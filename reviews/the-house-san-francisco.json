It was past the usual lunch hour rush so we were seated within a minute of arriving.\n\nWe ordered a few items to share.\n\nUnagi avocado sandwich - I did not know this combo was even possible. I have only had unagi in sushi, but this sandwich was amazingly delicious. And only $14??? I have had fried chicken sandwiches which have cost more. This was a steal! \n\nSmall plate - white shrimp & cheese chive dumplings - This was honestly the best shrimp & chive dumpling I have ever had and I have had many in various dim sum restaurants. The meat portion was absolutely perfect. \n\nSmall plate - Grilled octopus came with tempura potatoes and aioli. The octopus & aioli were a great match.

My boyfriend and I came on a Tuesday at 7PM for dinner.\n\nWe ordered the following five items to share:\n\nMiso black cod, crab avocado maki (5/5) - The cod with the sauce was delicious. This was my second favorite dish.\n\nDeep-fried salmon roll, Chinese hot mustard (5/5) - This is like a salmon egg roll. Perfect dish for people who love salmon and deep fried food.\n\nSoft shell crab with noodles (3/5) - The soft shell crab was alright. It came with cold noodles and I prefer to eat my noodles warm/hot. I felt like the liquid wasabi sauce didn't go well with the crab. I wasn't too fond of this dish. \n\nGrilled octopus with tempura potatoes (5/5) - I'm a huge fan of octopus and potatoes. This was my favorite dish. Everything was cooked and seasoned well.\n\nBittersweet chocolate truffle cake with ice cream (5/5) - This dessert dish is perfect for chocolate lovers.\n\nNotes: The restaurant is pretty small, so there's limited seating space. Make sure to make reservations ahead of time. After 15 minutes being seated, the restaurant started to get packed. Parking is extremely difficult, so I recommend taking public transportation, walking, or carpooling. The service was excellent. The waiters/waitresses were attentive to refilling our water cups and clearing out the empty dishes on the table. The experience was pleasant and we really enjoyed our meals. The food came out pretty quick, except for the miso black cod, which took a while. We will definitely come back here to try other dishes on the menu.", "author": "Sylvia H."}

The restaurant itself is quite small so I definitely wouldn't take a large group here but for groups of 4-5 I'd say it's perfect. It's a sweet little Asian fusion restaurant that encapsulates the name \"The House\" perfectly. \n\nI came here on a Wednesday night with three others and we were seated immediately even though our reservation was for an hour later. Service was quick & on point and they constantly checked on us to see if we wanted more water/wine. \n\nWe decided to go all out and treat ourselves so we splurged on two large entrees and several appetizers. My favorites were the steak (so so tender and delicious), the cod (the sauce is to die for!), as well as the poke and shrimp & chives dumpling appetizers. The sauce on everything was amazing and made the respective flavors really jump out at us. \n\nFor dessert we had the blueberry bread pudding with vanilla ice cream as well as the chocolate cake with coffee ice cream.

Maybe a bit more acid, like lemon, to brighten it up? Something is missing. \n\nWasabi noodles: 4.5/5 the pork was a bit dry. Appreciated the kimchi like flavors throughout the dish.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-08-29", "description": "Beautiful little spaces that do their own thing, night after night, and have it so dialed in that it's a delightful experience, are very rare to find. You may see a few more in big cities, because of the make-or-break nature of a saturated dining scene, but no matter where you are, this is a real feat.\n\nBeating the odds failure for any restaurant, after all, is a pretty hefty task. So when I sat down at The House after a last-minute invitation from work family, I really didn't know what to expect other than I knew already like the space, cozy as it was, and that I was with some serious food fans.\n\nIt didn't take long to realize that The House knows what's up. That they're dialed in and focused on what they do, that they know their identity, and that they turn those tables efficiently while still allowing you to enjoy your evening. They're well-oiled.\n\nIf you can go with friends, I recommend it. There are so many items you'll want to try and being constrained to just one would have been rough. Between the four of us, we ordered grilled octopus, ribs, noodles & steak, tuna tartare, sea bass, a pork chop, and cod. The sea bass had come highly recommended from a coworker and definitely didn't disappoint, though after we started with that tartare I knew we were in good hands--seafood can be an art and again, they've got artists on staff. If I had to pick a weak link it would be the ribs, but you're just not going to be disappointed in them. If you could only get one thing, though, I'd stick with that sea bass and ask if the cod is on special. I dug it.\n\nI expected to pay a little more, but for sure this isn't a cheap meal. They're efficient which means they keep prices competitive, but they're also making good food with fresh, quality ingredients and they gotta pay that rent. It's a great place for a classy work dinner if you know the folks, but more suited to something a bit more intimate--a nice night out catching up with old friends, somewhere to take your parents when they visit from out of town, or a third date when you really like them.", "author": "Jeffrey S."}

However, The House has achieved this balance with innovative and tasty food! \n\nI walked in at 7pm and thought I wouldn't be able to get a spot for 2 without a reservation, but luckily there are tables crammed into the hallway behind the central area you see when you look through the window. It's a tight squeeze, but I'd rather run into a couple elbows than not get my dinner. \n\nWe ordered the grilled shrimp salad, deep-fried salmon rolls, Korean short rib special, and wasabi noodles with flatiron steak. The grilled shrimp salad was a bit weird to me - I couldn't really identify many pieces of shrimp among the pork skin, and I'm also not a huge fan of chicharrones. The deep fried salmon rolls had a deliciously thin fried layer, but the best part is the tingly sauce you dip them in. \n\nWhile the wasabi noodles had a good texture, I wasn't really tasting the wasabi until the very end. The real show-stopper was the Korean short ribs. They were so tender and cooked perfectly, the small mountain of fried shallots (or whatever it was) managed to be flavorful, and the kimchi had this hint of sweetness that you don't normally get from jarred kimchi from the supermarket.

They did such a good job cooking the fish, the sauce was amazing, and they added elements to make the dish all around textured. Crispy elements with the crunch on top. It was perfect! Still thinking about this :)\n\nHalibut with noodles (5 stars)- Basic fish dish but my cousin has some dietary restrictions and so this was perfect for her. But even without all the fancy sauce or condiments this was very delicious and she enjoyed it!\n\nShort rib special with kimchi (5 stars)- This was amazing! I was skeptical when this came because it was cut up and looked like a flat iron steak which is normally super chewy. But it wasn't and was soooo tender and full of flavor, also had some crunchiness goodies on top which made the dish even better.\n\nMade a special vegetarian dish with noodles and tofu in a curry sauce (5 stars)- Awesome they could accommodate vegetarians with tasty dishes too since it's mainly an asian seafood place.

My memory fails me as this was over two months ago\nCONS:\n-none\n\nSeared Ahi with green beans\nPROS: \n- perfect quantity, even to share\n- well cooked, not under and not over\n- well seasoned: not too salty, not too bland\n- green beans were not overly oily\n- nice balance between carbs, protein, and vegetable\nCONS:\n- some kind of sauce or glaze would be nice but not entirely necessary\n\nI'd definitely come back here.  The service was great, never had to wait or ask for any refills for water.  Admittedly, the wait is long but that's normal for a good place.  For those of you who refuse to wait, that's totally fine but for me a lot of things are worth the wait, food included.  I'd totally recommend this place as a good date place except for the fact that it is loud and the space is a bit cramped.  Good to catch up with a friend though for sure!", "author": "Vera L."}

Super happy that I finally get to experience The House, during my recent visit to SF with my cousin and her family who lives in Daly City. This is her favorite restaurant. Prior to visiting she gave me a list of restaurants and suggestions and after seeing the photos and Yelp reviews I told her lets go to The House!! \n\nReservations confirmed, meet at The House at 11:30 am. We took the Bart and headed to SF's Chinatown before meeting up. I had my luggage  with me so the restaurant staff was nice to let me store them in the corner. The House is a tiny fusion restaurant, and during my dining experience we did feel crampy, when we got to our reserved table, but it was fine, The main thing I was grateful I am in SF, at The House, and get to spend time with family. The House sure filled up fast for lunch. \n\nSince my cousin doesn't eat seafood but loves The House's King Salmon entr\u00e9e we let her do the ordering for us. She raves about the king salmon with wasabi noodles. We started off with complimentary pickled cucumber from The House, which was refreshing. Our waiter was friendly and patient. \n\nNote: The salmon entr\u00e9e is spicy so don't forget to order it mild, my cousin noticed it was a little more spicy this time. \n\nOur orders: Salad, baby greens passion fruit , with vinaigrette ( 10.00)\nI am not a fan of salad but this salad was very tasty, light, and refreshing. Baby greens, with slices of apple with a light vinaigrette dressing. \nWhite shrimp and Chinese chive dumplings ( 12.00) As I am eating the dumplings, I can see they don't skimp on the filling, its huge. This dumplings is nice, soft and cooked just perfect.\nThe grand finale, 4 orders of King Salmon with wasabi house noodles (15.00) Wow!! This entr\u00e9e is AMAZING! I can see why this is my cousin's favorite entr\u00e9e. This entr\u00e9e is very fusion, I'll say with a mix of American, Chinese, & Korean. I loved the Wasabi noodles, very tasty, chewy, served with shredded cucumbers, pickled kim chee veggies, and a huge piece of King Salmon flavored and cooked to perfection. \nOur entire party of 5 enjoyed this entr\u00e9e. The prices are reasonable! \n\nParking: Parking could be a hassle in the city but super worth it, even though we Bart it, parking info. will be for my next visit.  Metered street parking lots at 766 Vallejo Street Garage and around the corner From The House at 65 Fresno Alley Parking Lot. \n\nThe House is very popular, on Zagat's Top 50 Best Restaurants in San Francisco, on Zagat's 10 must eat dishes. \n\nOverall, I thank my cousin for the recommendations. Great times with family @ The House in San Fran. I can't wait to be back again!! \n\nIt is a must to visit, when in San Fran!", "author": "Judy C."}

Complimentary Salmon Roll - delicious!  The entire roll was salmon as you can see in my photo.  The sauce it comes with tastes like wasabi which I loved.  \n\n2. Steamed mussels in garlic infused shrimp broth - this was really good. The mussels were a little small. The broth was delicious. Although, I actually prefer the buttery french version. \n\n3. Grilled Eel, avocado sushi rice, bonito flakes - really delicious.  This is probably my favorite of the appetizers I tried.\n\n4. Caesar Salad, cripsy scallop - this was good. The best part was the fried scallop.  They cooked it just enough so the scallop was still tender.  The rest of the salad was kind of boring.  \n\n5. Grilled sea bass, garlic ginger soy - absolutely delicious. The sea bass was again cooked just enough so that it was still flakey and soft. The soy sauce it came with was the perfect compliment. It comes with a portion of noodles and green beans. The noodles were delicious even though they were too soft for me. They would have been better if they cooked them for less time. The green beans were unremarkable. \n\n6. Ahi tuna, spicy mustard aioli - underwhelming. It looks more exciting than it tastes. The tuna was cooked well, still raw in the center. Overall, it was pretty bland. The rice isn't sushi rice either. It could have used more aioli. I ended up using the soy sauce from the sea bass to add more flavor to the tuna and rice (which is pretty much the plate)\n\n7. Panacotta - this wasn't on the menu but the waitress mentioned it. I would pass on this. It's good if you want something not too sweet..but it's also not flavorful either. It's kind of like soft jello with some berries on top. \n\n8. Bittersweet chocolate truffle cake, coffee ice cream, coconut caramel - The cake was absolute delicious. If you are someone who loves dense chocolate cakes you'll like this.  It's actually not really a cake; it's more like a large slide of fudge.  I think vanilla ice cream would have been better than coffee. \n\nThe service was eh. Not the usual super nice treatment you normally get at these types of places. But it wasn't terrible. My biggest complaint was the wait. I had 7:30 reservations and ended up waiting a half an hour. It kind of defeats the purpose of getting reservations if I still have to wait. \n\nTL;DR: Some of the dishes were really good, some weren't so much. If you have a reservation, still expect to wait. The eel appetizer, sea bass main, and chocolate cake were bomb. I would come back again.", "author": "Jon P."}

This place clearly honed in my mind why San Francisco is such a great \"foodie\" city. The food here was incredible. And usually, after eating Asian food, I tend to feel like shit because of all the oil but after this meal, I felt real clean even though I just ate 2 people's worth of meals. \n\nAppetizers: We started with a half dozen of oysters ($13) and they were some fresh AF oysters and reeaal tasty. I mean, you're in SF, so expect some real good oysters but the oysters they have here were top notch. We also started with the octopus with potato tempura. This was also amazing and a must- have appetizer. Octopus was tender, and the potato tempura, which I've never had, were nice and crispy and tasted great with the sauce they put in. \n\nEntrees: Two of my lunchmates had the pork chop ($23) which looked AMAZING. It was made with a pomegranate seed sauce which I've never seen but  the two guys who were eating raved about it and licked every piece of meat off the bone. I had the sea bass ($24) with noodles and green beans. Everything was good on my plate, I was just hoping for the sea bass to have more flavor but the sauce they provided helped and was real tasty but a little on the salty side. My 4th lunchmate had the wasabi house noodles with salmon ($12). He said it was tasty as well, and it's one of the more affordable entrees. \n\nDessert: Of course, with everything tasting so good, we had to try some desserts. The desserts we had are seasonal I believe so they change them every so often but will always be good! Two of us had their homemade cheesecake ($9) which was great and much better than cheesecake factory's! Another had the chocolate truffle cake.\n\nService was amazing as well, the staff was so nice and accommodating. Coming here you will absolutely not be sorry.

They refilled waters when needed and didn't bother us to much or try to make a ton of conversation. They don't need any improvement on this part whatsoever, but it wasn't anything to rave about. You come here for the food anyway!\n\nWe came for dinner on a Thursday night, the day after Valentine's Day to celebrate it.\nArrived at 725 for a 730 reservation. They seated me within a few mins and gave menus. They didn't bother me while I waited for my boyfriend to park the car which was nice.\n\nI heard a family of 4 being told it was a 40 min wait for a walk in. And I never saw more than 1-2 small parties waiting at a time.\nI also heard the waitress deny the party sitting next to me from ordering more food (they were a party of 6 and had mostly finished their entrees except one guy who was working on the last of it) stating that they have a time limit on the table because they have people waiting. From the looks of it, the guy had probably made 2-3 additional entree orders while the rest of his group just sat there waiting.\n\nAfter parking down the street and around the corner, my boyfriend and I settled on the mussels and ahi tuna tartare for apps and the prime rib eye and sesame soy king salmon.\n\nThe food came out surprisingly fast for how busy it was. It probably took about 7 mins for the apps which came out at the same time.\n\nThe mussels were very good. I'm a huge fan of mussels in general, but these were cooked to perfection. The broth in them was very good as well, so we got some extra bread for dipping it.\n\nThe ahi was good as well, but I probably would have preferred to try the salmon rolls instead. The tartare was flavored well and fish was very fresh, it was just missing a little something to make the dish whole.\n\nThe entrees came to our table perfectly-timed, just as we were finishing up the appetizers and had some more room on our cozy two person table.\n\nThe salmon was perfectly cooked as well and the glaze on it was very good. It's an extremely light dish which is nice. (I only ordered this because I was being basic on the keto diet at the time.) But it was very enjoyable. I'm definitely familiar with bok choy which it the salmon sits on, but never have I ever seen it this perfectly cooked. Typically you need to chew it a little to break off pieces that are social acceptable for you to chew and swallow (and without choking) but my teeth cut into those babies like a warm knife on room temp butter! I was incredibly surprised!! The salmon was MOIST (sorry) and flavorful.\nI was confused about the broth...the dish came with a bowl of rice, was I supposed to dump that in and eat it with the soup? (It seemed weird and I wasn't eating rice anyway) but the broth seemed too thin for that, but it was very good alone.\n\nThe ribeye was extremely good. There was very little inedible cartilage (which, hopefully you are familiar, is completely normal). The mashed potatoes were extremely...okay. It wasn't on the level as the ribeye or anything else we had was. It was just plain mashed potatoes. I can't say the texture or flavor was anything special. It was something you had at thanksgiving from someone that made it 1-2 times a year and you can accept. Though my boyfriend said he really like the cauliflower (which i didn't try) too many carbs LOL.\n\nThe creme brulee the table next to us got looked delicious, but we had plans to go across the street for dessert. In hindsight, should have gotten the creme brulee!\n\nOverall, they cook everything perfectly. Seriously.

It may be hard to score a reservation, but if you dine at an off-peak time you can just walk right in like we did.\n\nI originally dined here on my bday earlier this year and just loved it so when we were on the hunt for a place to eat last night we took a chance that maybe there would be a spot open since it was already after 8pm.  Sure enough there was no wait!\n\nLike last time, we started off with the Ahi tartare because it's so hard to resist.  You may argue who would pay $13 for 3 chips and a small heap of raw fish but if you close your eyes with every bite you'll be able to savor the poke and the nori chip that no Poke Bowl can replicate.  The other not-to-miss favorite would have to be the Seabass.  It's about a 4x4 inch grilled chilean Seabass that's cooked to perfection and served with a side of green beans on the night we went.  I wanted the ribeye, but since was already sold out so we opted for the flatiron steak which I would skip next time.  It was a bit dry and not what I would expect from The House.\n\nThe place is very small and cramped so if you aren't into eavesdropping on your neighbor's conversation and playing footsies with them then this place isn't for you.  Also since a table for 2 may be a bit small for the dishes, try to score a larger table or eat fast before the next plate comes or you'll be stacking dishes.  \n\nService is always great and the single bathroom is quite clean.  \n\nIf you dine here, let me know if the placemat is distracting to you like it is for me.  My peripheral kept making me think I dropped something!  Stop messing with me guys!", "author": "Alex L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-08-20", "description": "Asian fusion on steroid, that's probably the best way I can describe this place.\nThe House was recommended by a lot of our friends who visited previously. I wasn't sure how busy or crowded this place would be on a Friday night so I called ahead to make the earliest reservation possible- They open at 5:30pm so 5:30pm it is. \n\nWe got to the area a little bit earlier because we don't know the area very well and surely we got lost.  Btw the restaurant is not easily noticeable from the outside and it's located on an unassuming street (almost seems like you are going into a small alleyway). So the best way to find the place is once you made a right turn onto Grant Ave, look for an erotic lingerie place and the restaurant is right next to it. \n\nFirst impression- very simple d\u00e9cor with beige color tables lined from the front to back.  Organize, bright and clean. There is very little room between the tables but since we came early and the restaurant was not full so this wasn't an issue.\n\nOnce we were seated, our waiter presented us with a small menu and began to tell us about all the specials they have for the day. Little did they know, we already knew what we wanted before we walked in (thanks friends and Yelp), but we patiently waited for our waiter to finish and ordered the following:\nSoft Shell Crab appetizer \nGrilled Sea Bass, garlic ginger soy sauce with garlic noodle and string beans entree\nGrilled Ahi Tuna (rare), spicy mustard aioli with sticky rice \n \nThe soft shell crab appetizer was nothing but spectacular both in presentation and in taste.  I'm a bit afraid to eat soft shell crab because sometimes they taste super mushy in the middle and gives this raw taste in the center.  I'm glad this is not the case here, the soft shell crab tasted fresh and cooked perfectly, crunchy on the outside and soft but still somewhat firm on the inside- exactly what you expect fresh seafood to taste like.  The sweet and sour tomato spaghetti? was an interesting side to accompany the soft shell crab, I'm not sure if it's a different take on the traditional sweet and sour sauce but it works great to balance out the greasiness and eliminate some fishiness from the soft shell crab. \n\nThe Grill Sea Bass, garlic ginger soy sauce with garlic noodle and string beans had to be my favorite out of the three.  Sea Bass was perfectly cooked, it was flaky, buttery, well-seasoned and lightly grill on the outside for a slight smoky flavor.  The garlic noodle had a stronger flavor which went great with the light and buttery sea bass and the string beans served as a perfect balance between the fish and the noodle, giving it a refreshing and light crunchy texture. It was just delicious and the sea bass really melts in your mouth and both my wife and I had our eyes wide open after our first bite wondering how they made it so buttery. This is a must try!\n\nThe Grilled Ahi Tuna, spicy mustard aioli with sticky rice and snow pea leaves(?) was an excellent choice as well.  The presentation was amazing, 5 pieces of grilled Ahi Tuna, leaning on a sticky rice island with snow pea leaves on the side surrounded all by spicy mustard aioli with the rice and Ahi Tuna island was topped with fried taro straws, gorgeous, just gorgeous presentation.  The taste was as strong as it's presentation. The Ahi Tuna was fresh and seared nicely on the outside, the raw part of the tuna was not flavored but I'm okay with that since the spicy mustard aioli provided much of the seasoning. The spicy mustard aioli was not too mustardy but it was creamy and super flavorful. The rice and the snow pea leaves were a great compliment for the tuna to offset the fishiness and give the dish more variety of textures and flavor. By the way the snow pea leaves was silky smooth and well-seasoned.  The rice had a somewhat chewy texture and balanced the rich and creaminess of the dish well. The fried taro straws gave it that much needed crunch and extra flavor.  It's truly a texture and flavor overload and it's a dish I enjoyed from start to finish.\n\nService: Our waiter was friendly and attentive and check frequently to make sure we are doing well.\n\nPrice: A bit higher than most Asian food in the area but it is very reasonable consider the food quality and service.  Another thing regarding price- You would expect a restaurant like this to give you small portions but nope, their portions are HUGE (and we are no small eaters) so you will walk out full and not need to eat instant noodle afterward. \n\nOverall: Definitely a must try restaurant when you are in SF! Excellent in food quality, service and value. Be sure to make a reservation because the restaurant tends to get pack fast and definitely try to sea bass.", "author": "Felix S."}

The salmon itself was good quality, with no gristle. The breading was crispy and had almost a tender flakiness. There wasn't much of a wow factor in its flavor. Probably the biggest fault was my overactive imagination, dreaming up something that would blow me away. The Chinese hot mustard came with it, pops spicy like a firecracker. \n\nThe umagi was some of the best eel I've had. It was so soft, I didn't have to use your teeth.

It was one of the few times in life where I couldn't tell whether the meat for the sauce was the best thing about the meal. The card was cooked just right, being tender, juicy, flaky, yet sturdy.  The lemon ponzu sauce was robust, sultry, yet with a light grace to it. The avocado oil surrounding the plate was a really nice touch.

The list can be pretty lengthy, so don't be afraid to ask twice. My fianc\u00e9 and I started with the mussels as an appetizer. The sauce was so delicious that I had a few more spoonfuls after the mussels were gone. I order the flank steak over wasabi noodles, a dish I was hesitant to get but was not disappointed. The steak was medium, just as I ordered it. It was already pre-sliced but savory. The noodles were fantastic and left a sweet hot aftertaste in your mouth. Before you know it, you're full and with a smile on your face. Next time I'm going to make room for dessert.", "author": "Joel G."}

I lived in North beach for almost 2 years walking by it daily and never went in (not because it didn't look cute/wasn't always packed...bc it is) but because I did not understand what I was missing out on!\n\nTHE SALMONS ROLLS ARE TO DIE FOR! DO NOT EVEN COME IF YOU DO NOT ORDER THESE! sorry for all caps..super passionate about this one I guess. \n\nAdditionally, from someone who likes pretty much everything but pickles...this place has some amazing pickle (swear they cannot be) that they bring out before the meals.  I OBSESSES OVER THE SPICY STEAK NOODLES and THE CHICKEN ENTREE WAS MELT IN YOUR MOUTH (best chicken i have ever had in my mouth to be exact)! okay I will calm down now..\n\nPS.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-03-31", "description": "We came here for an anniversary dinner on a Friday night -- the place is nestled in a little side street just off Columbus, so it's a good area if you are planning on going out in North Beach that evening. It's a bit small and cramped, and it seems pretty clear that the place is still figuring out what it wants to be exactly, but I feel like it was worth the shot in the dark even though it didn't blow us away. \n\nThe food portions were really intense. Normally for a fusion place like this I would expect a series of smaller plates, but the server recommended only one starter and two entrees. He rattled off a list of specials that was quite long and a little hard to keep track of, but we did end up going with his recommendations to varying degrees of success. The sake, wine and beer list was alright -- we just went with a few Hitachino beers, which was a nice touch for the place. \n\nWe started with the Hokkaido scallops, which had a nice sear and a pretty good texture. The flavor was alright and about what you'd expect for someone who knows how to cook them, but nothing out of this world. For entrees, we went with the black cod and short rib specials, which again was kind of a mixed bag. The black cod was very flavorful and cooked at a perfect temperature with a nice seat on it, but the miso flavor was a straight kick in the teeth strong. It wasn't bad, but it was quite intense. I didn't order it for myself and I'm not sure I could have finished it. \n\nI should probably mention that the portion sizes are massive. This felt like the kind of size you'd find at a restaurant in the south. The short rib came served with some shredded sweet potato (good), kimchi (great, but easy to find), and at least 8 or 10 ounces of short rib. I didn't come away from this dish feeling like it wasn't something I could pull off myself with a sous vide setup, but the temperature and flavor on it was quite good. It just didn't feel like something truly unique -- just a short rib that they nailed as good as you can get. \n\nThe desserts were fantastic. We went with the coconut cream br\u00fbl\u00e9e, which had a very rich cream, but the passion fruit flavor cut through it very nicely and it felt lighter than the actual content. The coffee and truffle chocolate cake was also great with a nice rich flavor and texture, though a bit unwieldy at times. Both of them were relatively inexpensive, but again, the portions were quite robust. \n\nThe total price of entry was just about $160 for two, which is something you'd expect for a mid- to upper-range restaurant. This place was pretty loud and I felt like I just about got my money's worth based off the whole experience. I did enjoy myself, but the meal did feel a little rushed, so I couldn't tell if they were trying to turn the table over quickly or things were just hectic. I would recommend it as a nice Friday date spot if you're looking for a little splurge, but not a place for a celebration as there are a lot of restaurants in SF that punch way above their weight at that price range.", "author": "Matthew L."}

I had the two coincidently planned all along. \n\nThe House has been on my radar for a long time. And when I first started yelping back in 2006, there were only 50 positive reviews. Now the restaurant has 4,000 with the latest review given by Joe Cool. \n\nWhat deterred me to dine here? And why did I wait this long?\n\nThis somewhat tiny restaurant is always crowded. It is also a bit swanky for me. But every now and then, I do like to treat myself.  \n\nI was here for lunch. The restaurant does have daily specials: one with seafood, which I don't like and one being a Rib Eye steak entr\u00e9e. It is not rocket-science to figure out what I opted for. For $30.00, the rib eye steak is an 8oz cut and flamed broiled to my liking. My entr\u00e9e also comprised garlic mashed potatoes and grilled cauliflower florets. The presentation of this dish was a work of art. And the tender steak is cooked perfectly. Honestly the House's version can give any steakhouse a challenge. \n\nI also added a large bottle of San Pelligrino mineral water for $5.00. The House also has a wine bar for all you wine-lovers. \n\nThe long-awaited visit has finally been accomplished. And the food and service by the cute waitresses were 5-stars.

The wait time was estimated to be about 30 minutes. They have a reservation system where it'll text you when your table is ready, so no need to linger around and wait.\n\nAlong with the standard menu, they have a long list of specials that the server will describe out. I found this to be unhelpful as items were easy to miss and we had to ask him to repeat the list.\n\nWe ordered the softshell crab appetizer (special), kobe beef tartare (special), and dumplings for our appetizers. For the main entrees, we ordered the korean short ribs and sea bass. Presentation here was on point!\n\nThe softshell crab appetizer was unique and was served alongside a side of spicy soba noodles--pretty good. I'm not a fan of raw beef so I didn't try the tartare, but my s/o said that there was way too much sauce to taste the beef flavor. Last and most disappointing, were the dumplings. For some reason, I thought that they'd be pan fried, but nope, they were boiled and kinda sad looking TBH. The flavor of the dumplings were nothing special.\n\nOnto the entrees: the korean short ribs were delish! Served with a side of rice, some broccolini, kimchi, and a mountain of fried sweet potato ribbons. The short ribs were nice and tender, but I wish there was a bigger portion of it. Half of the dish ended up being kimchi and sweet potato.\n\nThe sea bass is probably what The House is known for, and I completely agree, the fish was cooked perfectly! However, everything else that came along with it was extremely salty. The fish was already well seasoned, but paired alongside the noodles and green beans and dipping sauce, it was a salt overload! \n\nService was attentive, our glasses were never empty for more than a minute or so. \n\nOverall - glad I gave The House a try, but sadly, I don't think I'd come back for more.", "author": "Shirley H."}

If you intend to eat here, make a reservation. \n\nI have to start off by saying that the \"ramen\" wasn't really what I thought it would be. Which is probably why they didn't name it \"ramen\" on the menu. The Udon noodle soup with grilled chicken and toasted nori was delicious, but not really my speed. I wasn't a fan of the noodle texture, but wanted to try it anyway. It was seasoned to perfection, I just didn't like the mouth feel of the noodles. I'd use the broth for something else though! kudos!!!\n\nThe grilled octopus was to die for!!! I hadn't paid attention to the word \"grilled\" so when I got it, it was a surprise, but a beautiful one! The sriracha aioli was fantastic! I'd put it on everything! Actually we were dipping our food in the left overs because it was that good!!! \n\nThe Wasabi house noodles with grilled pork was one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. The pork was seasoned well, it fell apart in my mouth. The noodles were perfect, and there was the most fantastic seasoning ever! I'd honestly eat it by the buckets and didn't want to share.

Luckily, my friend made a reservation in advance, we showed up early, and we were promptly seated shortly after.\n\nThe restaurant is busy. There's no way around it, yet their service and staff are on their A game, juggling their many to-do's and customers. My glass never saw the halfway mark and the waitress knew exactly how to describe flavors and answer my party's questions.\n\nMy friend and I shared two small plates for our appetizer. The first was the Caesar salad with the deep-fried scallops. I'm a sucker for a good Caesar salad and the scallops were a nice treat to accompany the greens. But the grilled unagi appetizer, holy moly! The thick eel filet was hearty and succulent and perfectly matched with a seasoned avocado sushi rice. I still think about that eel dish to this day and if you do decide to get any kind of small plate, get the one with the unagi #casualFriendsreference\n\nFor my entree, I had the flat iron Angus steak with wasabi noodles. You're not getting his with the overbearing, sinus-cleansing type of wasabi you would normally get globbed up in a dish at your casual sushi joint. The flavor is subtle and expertly dressed on the noodles which are accompanied with housemade kimchi and other pickled vegetables. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare as ordered.\n\nMy friend had their lamb special that was being offered for the night of our visit. I'm not a huge lamb guy, I'm not fond of the gaminess in particular. But I had a bite and I could tell right off the bat that this lamb was cooked with care and precision. No gaminess and it just melted into your mouth. The three double-boned lamb lollipops were served with what seemed to be normal white rice. Be wary though, my friend's special was double the price tag of my steak dish and I feel like I ultimately got the better deal taste to price wise.\n\nLong story short, order that unagi dish!", "author": "Jonathan N."}

If you're coming by on a weekend afternoon, it might be a good idea to have a reservation, as it can get full inside. Here is what I tried:\n\nDeep Fried Salmon Roll - Simply incredible. It came out hot, crunchy, and the salmon was not overdone. Don't be afraid to try it with the chinese mustard-- it seems like it might be spicy, but it's delicious. I'd come back just for this dish alone.\n\nUnagi Avocado Sandwich - I really wanted to like this, but there were a couple of things wrong with it-- the bread was way too toasted. The toastiness/char on the bread took away from the unagi and avocado. I would have preferred that the bread by lightly toasted so that I could get everything in a single bite.\n\nUdon Noodle Soup - A wholesome, hearty soup, and perfect to help you get over a cold. I was prepared for the chicken breast to be slightly overdone (which wouldn't have mattered to me, since I know it'd be swimming in the broth), but to my surprise it was simply perfect. Still juicy and tender. The broth itself packed a little bit of a kick, and the cherry tomatoes packed a neat little burst of umami in every bite.

It looks unassuming from the outside but the inside is quite spacious - my only gripe is that the tables are placed pretty close together so you can overhear a lot of other conversations. The service was prompt and our waters were refilled multiple times. There were also 4 appetizer and 3 entree specials, so be sure to hear what those are before deciding! \n\nWe ordered the following:\nDeep fried salmon roll, Chinese hot mustard ($13): after reading all of the rave reviews about this appetizer, we had to order it. I think this was the only part of the meal that didn't exceed expectations. The deep fried roll was crunchy and warm and stuffed with a lot of salmon, but the flavors didn't blow me away. The hot mustard was a nice touch and definitely cleared the sinuses. I like the pickled vegetables that are served with the dish which can help temper the hot mustard.\nCurry noodles with grilled chicken ($14): this was delicious, and a huge portion! Definitely a great deal. The curry was thick and fragrant, and the chicken was super tender and flavorful. Some of the best grilled chicken I've had in a while. The presentation was also beautiful and this is probably the first dish I've had with carrots that I didn't dislike (I normally- the carrots were mainly a garnish on top and were thinly sliced and fried for texture and crunch. \nGrilled sea bass ($29): enough has been written about the sea bass on Yelp so I won't recapitulate, but suffice to say this is probably the best sea bass I've had. It was buttery and flaky and delicious, and paired really well with the salty soy dipping sauce and the garlic noodles and green beans. Again, a hearty portion. \n\nOverall, I think this restaurant is a 4.5 rounded up to a 5.", "author": "Amy C."}

You seriously can't go wrong with anything on the menu and the server thought we were crazy when we wanted to order so many dishes! What's great is that this restaurant is super accommodating -- we really wanted to try the wasabi noodles but also wanted the sea bass. He was able to swap out the steak w/ the sea bass! Win!\n\nAll the dishes were flavorful and well thought out. I personally thought the appetizers were the star dishes -- We started w/ the fried salmon rolls (sounds weird, right?) but the mustard dip complimented it so well. the scallops and the ponzu yuzu sauce was amazing, and so was the unagi avocado rice. Clean plate club! Finished everything!\n\nThe main dishes were pretty good, too. I thought the pork chop was a bit overcooked and dry...so i was not impressed with this. It's a huge portion btw, I was surprised a lot of people were eating this as their main dish. The sea bass was cooked perfectly and so buttery and melts in your mouth! We wished that the sea bass was served on the side and not on top of the wasabi noodles because we felt the sauce and flavors of the noodles overpowered the fish. We were also a bit confused because we didn't really taste any wasabi flavors? It tasted pretty garlicky and savory so we thought they cooked us garlic noodles by mistake.

The outside is very unassuming and could be easily missed, and that speaks to how good this restaurant is, since even though the exterior isn't particularly flashy, it always has a full house! He interior is modern and cozy, perfect for a date night! We started our meal with the salmon rolls and the unagi. The unagi was tasty with a really delicious sauce covering the whole roll, but we decided when we come back we probably won't order it again since it is so similar to an eel roll you could get at other sushi places. On the other hand, those salmon rolls were amazing! Crunchy exterior and nice meaty pieces of salmon on the inside- we could've eaten a couple of orders of those! Next we got the black cod which was one of the specials. It has 2 little rolls on top of the fish which were tasty, but that cod was definitely the star! It had a subtle sweet flavor and was cooked to perfection with an awesome buttery texture. That was definitely my favorite dish! We were still a little hungry after splitting those dishes, so we finished the meal with the sashimi which had 2 pieces of each of 3 different fish. The fish was super fresh, and it was the perfect palate cleanser to end the meal. Overall, this restaurant was definitely worth the wait, and we'll definitely be back!\n\nAlso FYI, we called to ask about what the corkage fee was, and I think it was either $30 or $35!", "author": "Rachel D."}

I absolutely love unagi, and it came baked and was placed on top of rice. The rice was seasoned and had this magical sauce mixed on top, which made it taste so good.

While the decor is nice, the place is definitely cramped, so be prepared to bump elbows.\n\nWe started with the deep-fried salmon roll with Chinese mustard sauce--the salmon was partially cooked and the rolls were beautifully presented. They went so nicely with the slightly spicy sauce on the side. The scallops (a special on the appetizer menu) were fried and served with a tasty sauce, but some of the coating was burnt and there was a slight bitter tinge to them. The homemade shrimp and chive dumplings were tasty, though I didn't find them all that memorable. While the appetizers were decent, I think the main course dishes are really the ones to come for!\n\nFirst, we had the wasabi noodles with flatiron steak, dressed with cucumber and kimchi. The steak was cooked to a perfect, tender medium-rare, but the noodles were a miss for me--they were too garlicky and didn't have much other flavor (certainly none of the wasabi flavor I was expecting). My favorite dish overall was the seared ahi tuna--the middle of the tuna was still rare, and the slices were so tender. The tuna came with rice and strips of taro, along with a spicy mustard aioli--combining all of these components yielded perfect bites of contrasting textures (soft and crunchy) and amazing flavor! While my favorite dish overall was the tuna, by far my favorite protein from the menu was the sea bass (which came with a garlic ginger soy sauce)--seared to perfection and so soft, buttery, and flavorful--this was some of the best bass I've ever tasted!\n\nOverall, I found the dishes here very creative, and the entrees were especially memorable.

The specials of day are not on the menu. They list the specials verbally when you sit down. We ordered: \n+ Oysters (6) $15: very fresh oysters served with a soy sauce mixed with cilantro and jalapeno\n+ Grilled Octopus w/ deep fried potatoes: super crunchy octopus with sauce that complimented it very well \n+ Scallops (3): this was soo good! The scallop was cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious! Everyone went back to spoon more sauce on their scallop.   \n+ Truffle Halibut (Special) Halibut: this is a creamy dish. With halibut served on a bed of mash potatoes and corn, topped with deep fried beets. This was a very flavorful dish, but the truffle flavor wasn't strong enough. \n+ Black Cod: Best dish of the night! Best cod I've ever had! No wonder everyone orders it! The cod was so tender it practically melts in your mouth! and the 2 slices of sushi was a great touch to the fish. And the sauces worked very well with the dish. \n\nSERVICE: \nSuper attentive and friendly! The food also came out pretty quickly! \n\nAMBIANCE: \nVery cozy! It's actually a lot smaller than it looks like in the pictures. They fit mostly tables of 2-4 people. Although, I'm sure if you make reservations they can accommodate for more. They are located in North Beach (aka: impossible parking) so I would recommend parking in the parking lot under the park in Chinatown and make the short walk here.\n\nVerdict: I would definitely come back to check out their other entrees! Or perhaps for lunch!", "author": "Samantha F."}

Both of them straight up said \"you can only get the sea bass or the pork chop.\" They were right! \n\nAPPETIZERS \n-Scallops: 5/5\nI don't know what they made it with.... magic? But it was like a party in my mouth! Soft scallops that melt in your mouth, topped with sea crest and an amazing olive oil sauce? & caviar.... FANCY! \n\n-Deep fried salmon rolls: 3/5 \nI read so many good things about this fish. Must say.... I wasn't that happy with it. The soft raw salmon inside and the crunchy wrap on the outside, YUM! But the spicy mustard.... eh. \n\nENTREES \n-Sea bass: 6/5\nYaaaaas! You get a perfectly cooked piece of meat, with a side of bomb dot com garlic noodles &I also yummy greens. Everything about this dish is \"YAS!\" I literally wanted to lick my plate. \n\n-Pork chop:4/5\nThe pork chop came with a pomegranate sauce, it was pretty tasty! The pork chop was cooked medium- perfect! Overall it was yummy yummy, but having a bite after my sea bass... nothing compared.\n\nDESSERT\n-Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e: 2/5\nIt was a coconut creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e with a passion fruit glaze. The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e alone was good but the passion fruit glaze made it very tart, my eye was twitching by how sour it was. \n\nOverall it's a VERY SMALL place. A reservation is a MUST! There's around only 15 tables? And they're all very close together. Imagine the wait? Nightmare! But this place was amazing!

I always thought The House was making Asian food with a French food making attitude. I've been there many times and had brought friends over many times for that reason to enjoy the beautifully created and delivered food. However, I was very disappointed with the current menu as many of the iconic options are no longer available. For what's available, nothing stood out to me. Additionally, the food quality is no long the same in my most recent visit last week.

It was still my birthday weekend and we were in town as a stop-over on our way to Palo Alto. Looking at the reviews on Yelp and seeing how crowded they were on that overcast morning, we were suddenly very excited to try out their offerings from the moment we walked in. We tried the Salmon spring rolls to start--this was a direct result of some of the reviews we read. They were very well flavored and with just the right amount of crunch. Good so far but I've had similar in a popular chain of restaurants so I wasn't blown away as I thought I might be. Next, I tried the halibut and while I would say the amount of food offered was not a lot, the fish was cooked absolutely perfectly with just the right amount of crispness on the edges. It was placed over thick noodles that seemed to be high in liquid smoke, but quite good. I was definitely happy. And as it was my birthday, we opted for flourless chocolate cake and a scoop of coffee-flavored ice cream (which they comped). It was surprising how typically American the desserts were. Not a problem, but just an observation. \n\nI'd say we left happy, though maybe for the amount we spent, we felt like the value wasn't the greatest. Still very good.", "author": "Brad S."}

I was looking for the top places to eat in San Francisco so I gave it a go. We made reservations because we heard it gets really packed on the weekends. Before I went to The House, I looked it up on yelp to see what kind of food they served. It looked like Asian fusion that looked more upscale.\n\nMy thoughts and ratings:\n\n FIRST IMPRESSION: 2 Stars\n\nThe place is kind of hidden. I abruptly stopped walking because our friend knew where the place was. The restaurant looked kinda out of place. The inside was much smaller than I had expected. It looked like a small Pho restaurant (viet noodle restaurant). It was very cramped and claustrophobic. For upscale food, the restaurant itself looked very casual.\n\nSERVICE: 3 Stars\n\nRight when we got into the restaurant, we told the servers that we had reservations. Now, I have worked in various restaurants with reservations. You could immediately tell they did not have us planned to dine with them even though we called and made reservations. So guess what they did? Cleaned up a corner table that recently left and then sat us there. There were 5 of us and it was super cramped. Was not happy about it but hey, we got a table. Rest of the service was average and the food came out quickly. I think they need to train their servers on pouring bottled beer into a glass. The server had no idea how to pour the beer into a glass. It was 70% foam in the glass. We had two beers and she poured both of them like it was wine. Not really impressed.\n\nFOOD: 5 Stars\n\nOh Em Gee. The food was bomb! We ordered the salmon roll, seabass, salmon, pork chop, and the cod. The food looked so delicious and it tasted even more delicious. My favorite was the cod with slanted sliced sushi rolls. The food was very flavorful and really well presented. I was really happy about the food.\n\nOVERALL THOUGHTS: 4 Stars\n\nThe restaurant was cramped and it did not match the upscale look of the food they were serving. The service was average and nothing to really rave about. They had wine bottles by the cash register which was... odd. My view of the restaurant where I was sitting was the cash register and the kitchen right behind it. Not exactly the type of view I would want while eating great food lol I wasn't very far from it either. It didn't have any ambiance. This restaurant is more of a, \"eat your food and then go\" type of place. I felt like I couldn't really stay and enjoy the company I had. The only thing that saves this place is the food. Nothing more. If you're looking for a place to just have bomb Asian fusion food, this is definitely the place! Definitely coming back for the food only!", "author": "Tiger Y."}

If you want Asian fusion in the $24-$40 range per plate, I would recommend this spot..depending on what you order\n\nTo start off, this place is notoriously TINY, tiny as in \"you can bump elbows with the guest next to you\". So tiny that, my boyfriend was inches of getting barfed on by a passing customer (tru story). So it's best to get a reservation, especially if it's a party larger than 2. \nWe came around 6:30-7 Sunday night and only waited about 5 minutes for a table.\n\nMuscles appetizer: The broth for this dish was SO flavorful. My boyfriend and I ended up spooning the sauce as if it were soup when we were done. I wish it came with a side of some bread however. 8.5/10\n\nSea bass with garlic noodles: this is a dish The House is most known for. Admittedly the seabass was flakey and buttery, however it did not WOW me. The garlic noodles were very saucey, different than what you would typically find at Vietnamese/Cajun places. The sauce they provided on the side tasted similar to the sauce they use for the garlic noodles. If you really love grilled fish you may like this, but I think there may be better things offered. 7/10\n\nAngus steak: It was cooked to a medium rare and was quite juicy. It came with a side of mash potatoes that did not wow us, and some cauliflower. 7.5/10\n\nSolely on the food this place is a solid 3.5-4, however I wish they had their daily specials on some sort of board or menu. I'm sure I would have liked something better on that list.

There was no part of the meal that disappointed.\n\nThe pork chop is the best pork chop that I've ever had in my life. A lot of pork chops that I've had have been dry and tough, but the pork chop here is moist and soft. \n\nThis was my first time ever having sea bass, and I think I'm ruined for life. It was so soft, flakey, and buttery. The garlic noodles was a good pairing, as having the sea bass by itself may not have been enough food. \n\nEverything had a great flavor, and was not bland or too salty.

None of the main dishes stood out, so my friend and I ordered multiple \"smalls\".\n\n- Pickled cucumbers.  Bomb. Complimentary starter.  Fantastic zing from the vinegar with a hint of sweetness to balance it out.  Too bad you only get one tiny dish of it and then have to pay $5 for each extra one.\n- Unagi on avocado rice.  Let's be real...it's hard to get eel wrong...it will almost always be enjoyable.  Theirs was definitely flavorful, but it came from the dousing of terryaki sauce on the eel as well as the avocado rice below it that was probably more mayo than rice.  Let the eel speak for itself please.\n- Scallops.  The most well-done dish.  I'm not a huge scallops fan, but they cooked it extremely well.  Soft, but with a good bite to it.\n- Grilled Octopus.  Again...saucy.  I can't even give a review on what I thought because all I tasted was sauce.  Although...the crispy fried potatoes that are part of the dish were EXCELLENT.\n\nIf you couldn't tell by my review....it can be summed up in two words: Too Saucy.

And yes, the food here is DELICIOUS! \n\nIf you are going to attempt to order food to go, here is the  deal: they probably won't let you. \n\nOne fateful night, that Seabass was callin' our name and we attempted to phone in an order because we just didn't feel like dressing appropriately, showering, waiting in the cold, waiting in a packed restaurant, dining in a packed restaurant. You get the gist: it was a garlic noodle and Netflix night. \n\nOn the phone, a (bless her heart) airy gal said we can't make a to-go order unless we are on the approved list and if it's our first time ordering to go, it must be in person (which, albeit, unfortunately MOSTLY defeats the purpose of ordering to go for this situation). \n\nNext, manager hops on the line. To be fair, she was nice and I could tell she cared to an extent. She said if she could pull up an old reservation she \"would ALLOW me to order\" (Cue imperious tone). Problem is, though we've been there 4-5 times (and recommended this place to others) we've never made reservations. Cue awkward pause. \n\nWell. Thanks for offering me the favor of giving you my business but I'm not going to beg you to let me give you my money, if the pause was awaiting a plea & bargain. \n\nTo whoever owns this joint: It's 2017. Your food is popular and that's a great thing! We are in the digital age, in San Francisco for crying out loud. I know some very discourteous Donkey's probably order and never pick up- which creates a loss, but I offered to pay over the phone. There are services you can utilize to protect your business and better serve your customer (and not lose either way). \n\nI'm not going to be dramatic and not come back- heck, no one else in town is serving Sea bass like yours (yet).

Definitely recommend making a reservation if you have a larger party, or anything in general, since this place is quite a small establishment and quite popular even on a Monday! We came for my college graduation dinner, and I've got to say, I'm happy I chose this place. There's something for everyone (except I wouldn't recommend this place for vegans / vegetarians) - mostly known for their seafood, their pork chop was also AMAZING. \n\n[FOOD]\n1) Mushroom Rice with Truffle and Prawns (6/5) - This absolutely blew my mind away!! My mom and I were in heaven with this dish and that says something because my mom's taste buds are sooooo picky. The truffle taste wasn't too overwhelming, but perfectly there and the rice wasn't overlooked nor undercooked. I loved the bits of vegetables mixed in, as it added more texture and substance to the dish. \n2) Sea Bass (4/5) - Many fellow Yelpers love this dish, and I could see why. The sea bass was perfectly soft, smooth, and moist. Dip it into the sauce, and it was A+. My only gripe are that the noodles and the beans that came along with it weren't \"OMG\" but just a \"Oh, that's good too\". \n3) Pork Chop with Cranberry Sauce (5/5) - My second favorite dish here - the pork Chop was cooked to perfection, so moist! The cranberry sauce added the perfect amount of sweetness to bring this dish to a whole new level. Must get!\n4) Salmon Deep Fried Roll (3/5) - It wasn't anything too spectacular; salmon itself tends to be a bit dry. Dipped in the sauce, it was filled with flavor. \n\n[DESSERT]\n5) Blackberry Crumble Pie (5/5) - Yesssss!! My favorite dessert here. I don't know what it is about this; normally, I'm not a fan of Pie, but I think the crumble complemented the mushiness/softness of how a fruit pie usually tastes. I can't say the blackberry taste was very strong as there was also apple or something (I can't remember). \n6) Chocolate Macadamia Tart (3/5) - This was okay.. the chocolate macadamia tart part wasn't anything spectacular. The coffee ice cream went well with the chocolate, and it was definitely very chocolatey. I can't seem to describe the texture though \n7) Coconut Creme Brulee (4/5) - I think the sugar also has some lime, which some people in my family thought was odd since it wasn't exactly mixed into the dessert, but just a \"BAM! sour!\" The coconut part was very smooth, and not too overwhelmingly coconut if that's a concern \n\n[PARKING] \nParking can be a pain, especially in SF. There are plenty of street parking around, although difficult to find an open spot. I did see a parking lot sign right next to the restaurant though. \n\n[SERVICE]\nthey have specials of the night, and the waitresses and waiters were all very friendly.

They don't have an OpenTable or anything.\n\nI've ordered:\n1. Tuna tartare\n2. Shrimp and Chive Dumplings\n3. Deep-fried salmon rolls\n4. Grilled sea bass\n5. Wasabi noodles w/ flatiron steak\n\nI think that you can't go wrong ordering the grilled sea bass or the wasabi noodles. Those seem to be the dishes that people recommend the most, and there is a reason for it. The wasabi flavor in the noodles is not strong. The sea bass is always cooked perfectly. I tried the salmon rolls twice. It is served with a Chinese mustard sauce. I think it is worth trying once, but I don't have a strong urge to order it again. The dumplings are dumplings. Did they taste good? Yes, but I don't think I would order them again. I would want to try something else. The tuna tartare is always good.\n\nThis place is pretty small, and there are a ton of tables. Be prepared to basically eat on top of your table neighbors. Given the size of the place, I don't think this place would be good for large parties. The service can be a hit or a miss. There have been times that I have gone and service has been excellent. There have also been other times that I have gone and the service was meh with a lot of attitude. Given everything, I would come back. I think that the prices can be a bit steep for the portion that you get, but the food is always tasty and well executed.", "author": "Carolyn Z."}

I've never been a big fan of asian fusion restaurants but The House unexpectedly gave me a great impression!\n\nDeep fried salmon roll: 4.5/5 Did not smell fishy. Great textures: softness from salmon and crunchiness from the seaweed wrap. The Chinese mustard had wasabi in it and it went well with the roll.\n\nWasabi house noodles w/ flatiron steak: 4/5 I asked for a medium steak and I wish I gotten it a little rarer. I got this dish because I wanted to see what the hype over the wasabi noodles was about... I liked the noodles but without the wasabi it would've just been typical lo mein noodles with a lot of sauce. The noodles were a bit overcooked. Still good but not as impressive as the roll.\n\nLast but not least, the sea bass! 5/5 OMG this was the best dish of the night! I'm not a big fish fan but this sea bass blew my mind.

It was nearing dinner time and we decided to go down to The House. This is a pretty popular restaurant in SF, so we had to wait around 40 minutes. I recommend going there earlier so the lines are shorter. \nHowever, the lines were most definitely worth it. The food was AMAZING with a capital everything. I love love loved all the dishes my family ordered. The House is on the pricier side, so I recommend going there for a celebration of some kind like a birthday. To start off the meal, we ordered the appetizer, avocado dungess crab cake. It was sosososos good. It had a wonderful medley of flavors. I recommend ordering this. A tip of advice is incorporating everything into one bite. Like get a little of this and a little of that. I'm not really sure how to describe it... but yeah, order it! \nThen for the main courses, we ordered wasabi house noodles with angus flat iron steak, grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy, kurobuta pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce, and prime angus ribeye with house made teriyaki roasted garlic butter. The pork chop was the dish I ordered and I'm so glad I did. I stole little pieces from the other dishes my family ordered and the pork chop was the best, most outstanding dish. The meat was super tender and flavorful and that's not even the best part. The best component of the dish was the pomegranate current sauce. Wow, just wow. It was the perfect combination of sweet and a little acid. The house noodles were a close second though. My favorite type of noodles is thick chewy ones like the ones we got at The House. They were magnificent. They are a tab bit spicy so watch out for that. As for the ribeye and the sea bass, those were super delicious as well. I recommend all four of these main dishes. We didn't order dessert sadly because we were stuffed. The price for these dishes were not cheap, but at least they came with huge portions.

Call a week ahead too if you want to get a reasonable time for your party.\n\nThey have daily specials in addition to their crazy delicious menu. Came with 3 friends and we got their soft shell crab appetizer special. The presentation was spectacular, and it tasted even better. It was served with some angel hair pasta and the crab had some breadsticks sticking out of it for added effect. The crab was light and airy while still perfectly crunchy and without any of the pungent seafood smell.\n\nFor our main dishes, we went with the halibut special, which was served with a cream sauce, the flank steak and wasabi noodles and the lamb special. The halibut was cooked to perfection. It was crispy on the outside, but flaky and succulent inside. Paired with the cream sauce, it was a match made in heaven. The lamb chops were frenched on the rib, a difficult technique to get right, but this place made it look easy and clean. They'll cook the lamb to whatever temperature you request, and they'll nail it. The wasabi noodles and flank steak is their calling card, and it's easy to see why. The noodles are al dente and the wasabi has the right amount of spice to cut through the richness of the steak.\n\nThis place is ideal for a casual meet-up with friends, or it can be for a special occasion as well. The staff is really friendly and the service is timely and efficient.

I was pleasantly surprised since it was a Friday night and this restaurant is always packed. We got in a bit late due to the lack of parking around the area but we were still seated within 20 minutes. When we sat down, waters were brought to us almost immediately and our server told us about the specials that they had that weren't on the menu. I settled on the sea bass ($31) while my boyfriend had the wasabi noodles with flat iron steak ($24). O M G the sea bass was the best cooked fish dish I've ever had! It came with mini string beans and noodles - I don't know what kind of noodles they were, but I just know that it was full of flavor. Everything was insanely delicious and the sea bass paired perfectly with the sauce and literally melted in my mouth with every bite. I've had the wasabi noodles in the past and they're also very flavorful while the steak is always cooked to perfection. I wish I could've ordered small dishes/appetizers to try since our main dishes were so good but there's always next time. The entrees are decently priced for the portions given. I noticed they have a huge selection of wines as well - also a plus. Everything was fantastic and I can't wait to go back! \n\nTip: Reservations are a must since it's a smaller restaurant.

The best, hands down, was the sesame soy glazed king salmon. Though a bit pricier than the rest of the lunch options, the intense yet not overbearing teriyaki flavor that they are able to infuse with the salmon is mesmerizing. I usually find that salmon is almost always good, but rarely phenomenal because it's a relatively lackluster fish to start with. But for anyone who enjoys a great fish, this is a must. It's beautifully plated treasure for anyone who orders it.\n\nThe warm wasabi house noodles (which I got with chicken instead of salmon and that was a mistake!because the chicken came with the skin on it) was also a great option. It wasn't too spicy and the noodles and flavors were so unique. Next time, which there surely will be, I'm sticking to the salmon.", "author": "Jason S."}

The closest parking garage is about 2 blocks down on Columbus & Kearny St. I paid $18 for 2 hours. If u prefer to go the cheaper route (parking on the streets), give yourself 15-20min to find one. It is SF and the area stays busy. \n\nNow on to the food! The hype is REAL! LOVED the food! I highly recommend the Salmon Rolls for appetizers. I absolutely loved the texture of the Salmon with the crisp of frying the roll. They serve it with a wasabi sauce/salsa. I don't recommend dipping the roll in the sauce unless u absolutely love wasabi. Wasabi has a very particular taste and overdoing it can really ruin the taste of the roll. For dinner, I had the Wild Rice Mushroom Prawns and the Iron Steak with Wasabi Noodles. The Wild Rice Mushroom with Prawns was amazing. If you love comfort food, this would be the dish to get. It was a very unique dish and I've never had anything like it before. Really good though. The Steak w/ Wasabi Noodles I LOVED! The steak was cooked to perfection, so juicy and tasty.

I'm clearly part of the very small minority that doesn't see what the hype is with this place. I ate here for dinner with friends and none of us were blown away by the food. Now, to be fair, when I read Yelp reviews and see all five stars, I expect the food to knock my socks, pants and shirt off. Unrealistic? Perhaps. But when a restaurant has 4K+ reviews? I'd say it's downright as realistic as a heart attack.\n\nI don't know if one of my 10,000 tastebuds were just off the night I dined here, but I found almost everything I ate to be too salty. Here was our line-up:\n\n- Blue Lake Bean Tempura: Good, but how can you screw this up? It's just a green bean tossed in tempura batter and fried.\n\n- Ahi Tuna Tatare: Great. I wished I wasn't with three others so I wouldn't have had to share.\n\n- Steamed Mussels: So-so, but only after I shook the broth off of it. The broth was very salty.\n\n- Grilled Seabass (with garlic noodles): So here's the part where I think people would likely throw stones or tomatoes at me if I were reading this review aloud given the vast majority of diners come here for this dish alone. Now, let me first preface by saying I fully understand and know seabass is a naturally oily fish, but it's still my favorite type of fish nonetheless. BUT, for some reason, I felt the seabass here was even oilier. It tasted as if I was eating oil with a side of fish. And on top of that, the garlic ginger soy sauce was extremely salty. The garlic noodles ended up getting drenched in the garlic ginger soy sauce since it was all plated together so even that was too salty. It's unfortunate because I don't actually know what their garlic noodles should have tasted like. I wish they would have served it on the side vs. it swimming in the sauce. Two other friends ordered this as well and had the same overall opinion. It was quite disappointing because we all had high hopes for this dish. Another friend ordered the misoyaki fish entree off the specials menu and I wish I ordered that instead. Too bad it was just part of their specials because I would be willing to return for that particular dish. \n\nNeedless to say, I'm glad I tried this restaurant, but I won't be returning.

When we arrived we checked in with the server letting him know all our party member are here and our reservation was at 8:30. Our table wasn't ready yet so we just waited outside. There's not much space in here so usually people just wait outside. I knew exactly what I wanted so we ordered right away after we sat down. Customer service is great here, the staffs are very attentive. We got the ahi tuna tartare, grilled octopus, deep fried salmon roll, kurobuta pork chop, lastly strawberry rhubarb as our dessert. My mom got the famous grilled sea bass, brother got the wasabi noodle with Angus ribeye steak. The bill came out to be $190 not including tips. I would recommend this restaurant to all my friends! :)", "author": "Tina C."}

It would have been more helpful if specials were posted instead of recited by the servers. The first server we interacted with was all smiles but spoke so softly that we asked her to repeat twice, gave up and asked a different server. The second server was rude with how she questioned us about our orders and was a bit intense and cold. She was very quick not in an efficient way, but in a way that made us feel rushed and uncomfortable. The host just seemed unfriendly but we managed to get a smile out of her when we paid and left.\n\nThe sea bass and scallops were tasty! We ordered the Kobe beef but saw that the flat iron was more popular amongst that night's guests and looked to be a much heartier portion. The fried salmon and unagi were tasty with heavy Japanese influences.The halibut was also very good. I would have enjoyed a different side as both fish dishes came with a heavy portion of mashed potatoes that weren't quite seasoned or flavored. We finished with the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e which was nice. \n\nI don't know if I would return because I feel like fine dining needs be good food paired with great service.", "author": "Jay G."}

It is my new favorite spot, can't wait to go back for dinner, and try more of the menu.  It was so good, innovative, great, fresh ingredients taken to a new level.\n\nWe started with the octopus, I am now a major fan of octopus, tender meat, the sauce was siracha based I think, so good.  Similar to abalone.  I decided to have the fresh hamachi poke as my main, it was the best I have ever had.  Hamachi, tuna, avacado, popped rice for texture and an amazing dressing.  My husband had the warm, wasabi noodle bowl with sliced pork.  That was so good as well.  The flavors, textures and fusion twist makes for an exciting foodie experience.  Will be going back soon to try everything.  The dishes I saw coming out of the kitchen were all so delicious looking.  Service was good too.  It is a small restaurant, so when I go back I will make reservations.", "author": "Carole W."}

Our party of five at table meant for four. End seat inches from next table. Can hear everything they are saying. Hope they are neat eaters. Don't want to find food bits in my hair or on my leather coat. Btw, the adjoining table is a table of three stuffed into table for two. I wish they had stuck to the larger Sunset location and closed this closet instead.\n\nQuality and taste of food not as we remembered either. Sea bass and black cod not taste and texture we've enjoyed in the past. Pork chop much smaller, no longer thick cut and tasted like Chinese style Cha Siu, BBQ pork. Sauces way overdone..too sweet, too salty, etc. Not the umami flavors we used to love about this place.\n\nAnother star off for faking us out about coffee. Sold us on coffee being from Caffe Trieste and was French press. Did not mention not fresh French Press, but split leftover coffee from previous customer so my sister and I each got half a cup of lukewarm coffee that tasted watered down. So sad to see decline of this place. Fighting traffic and difficult parking to eat here no longer worth it. We typically spend about $300 for dinner here.

I went with my girlfriend on a Friday night around opening for dinner and the wait was already 45 minutes. Parking here is always a burden but luckily we were able to find a spot nearby. They send you a text message when your seat is ready so that is extremely convenient when you don't want to wait in SF's cold weather. \n\nThe servers are extremely attentive and know their menu very well. I was bummed that the soft shell crab was not in season because that is the best thing there! We ended up ordering the string bean tempura and those are to die for. The tempura batter is not heavy and there is still a crisp to each bite. Their tempura sauce is not the typical sauce you find at Japanese restaurants. It is more tangy and spicy, which gives the tempura string beans a good kick.\n\nFor dinner, my girlfriend and I love the wasabi noodles so much that we both ordered the same thing: Wasabi noodles with the flat iron steak. The steak was cooked perfectly to order and works well with the bed of zuchinni it sits on and red cabbage slaw on top. The ultimate bite is combining all four components of the dish. I would 100% order this again and again.\n\nAll in all, my experience at The House has been the best every time. Their food and service is top notch.

So I called The House from Hawaii and had no trouble getting in on Sunday, our arrival day.\n\nWhen we arrived we spent some time in Japantown and worked up an appetite.\n\nWhen we got to Chinatown and little Italy, we found exceptionally reasonable parking at the Police Station on Velajo. The restaurant was a short five-minute walk from there.\n\nWhen we got there we were greeted and seated rather promptly. After hearing the appetizers and specials, we decided to try it all along with their famous baked unagi.\n\nBoom! This restaurant rocketed to our Top 3 in the Nation. Up there with Spago Beverly Hills, , California and Mangowood in Woodstock, Vermont.\n\nThe lobster tempura was large. The base was light and tasty and the sauce rad incredible. The steamed clams were plentiful and served with bread to mop up the juice. The hamachi sashimi was oily and sweet and melted in our mouths. The seared scallops were lightly crusted on the outside and soft and warm on the inside.\n\nI was thinking if only I had ten thumbs they'd all be up at this point. Glad to say as the night went on they didn't eff up a thing. Except for the first appetizer that got set on our table with no introduction. The water was always filled and never got low.\n\nWe had the mushroom risotto with prawns. The sauce was piquant and the shrimps plump sweet and firm. Daughters had the angus steak and miso salmon. I had what I'll call, no blasphemy intended,  The Lamb of God. Tasted like it came off a Mongolian spit. It is was mind blowing.\n\nIf we lived here it's where we would go all the time.", "author": "Terry H."}

Ambience was more upscale than your neighborhood Chinese but not super fancy, so it was just right. Service was rushed, very hard to understand the specials because of the loud noise, our water was not refilled.

In other words, I experienced a fantastic Asian fusion meal due to the ingredients alone.\n\nMy Overall Rating - 5 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)\n\nAtmosphere - Make reservations!  It's a small restaurant so you'll get the best experience if you plan ahead.  San Francisco is hilly, so parking is a challenge but the restaurant is cozy and inviting.  There is raw wood featured throughout, giving it a very nice upscale, Asian feel.  1 Star.\n\nService - We had a team of great servers.  A restaurant like The House requires the staff to know and explain the menu.  We learned a lot about our dishes and they certainly made recommendations based on our likes and dislikes.  Throughout the meal the staff was attentive but not overbearing.   Great service.  1 Star.\n\nFood - Three standouts:  Wasabi house noodles (I paired it with Seabass), Kurobuta pork chop, & the Masami rib eye.  Bring a group of friends and order these items. The noodles were fantastic.  You can pair them with any protein, so I chose soy glazed seabass.  The fish was delicate, flaky, and absorbed the flavors well.  The Kurobuta pork chop is a Berkshire breed.  It was the juiciest and most tender chop I have ever eaten.  It was almost like a steak - but pork.  But surprisingly the rib eye was just as amazing.  I recommend splitting this dish into 3 or 4 parts so you can share.  The steak is well marinated and so tender.  The rib eye Asian flavors were subtle but delicious.  2 Stars.\n\nWill I Return? - Yes.  Every item we ordered was fully devoured.  The House is a great place for special occasions.  It's worth a visit whether you are local or visiting.  Quality comes first & it certainly shows.  1 Star.\n\nMy Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):\n1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.\n1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five-star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.\n2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.\n1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. \n\nEach Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score.", "author": "Trinh T."}

The decor was also very simple and minimalistic which allows our senses to fully enjoy the food at hand!\n\nI had the Warm wasabi house noodles with flatiron steak cooked perfectly to a medium rare. The dishes here were unique and I've never tried anything like them before.  A truly unique and original Asian Fusion place. The noodles were thick noodles, almost like udon noodles and had a great blend of spices and flavours, so it wasn't too bland but wasn't too overpowering. It was hard to describe in the moment but I remember it has something delicious to eat. It was a bit spicy which added nicely to the overall composition of the meal.\n\nAlso tried the Mushroom Cream rice with Shrimps! This dish was more saltier than the house noodles but it worked out very well. Sort of had the texture of risotto but was different at the same time and was put together very well.

Don't let the uninspired plating of the sea bass fool you - the fish was cooked simply but perfectly and melted in my mouth like butter. Far above and beyond the best dish of the night. In contrast, the pork chop was presented like a mouth-watering work of art - almost too pretty to eat! Their noodles appear to be made in house which is always an added bonus for me in any meal. We finished off with the coconut creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and a souffl\u00e9 for dessert. The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was underwhelming after the amazing meal we'd just had but the souffl\u00e9 was warm, fluffy, and perfectly moist.\n\nMake a reservation or expect to wait at least 30-60 minutes! Luckily they will call you when your table is ready so you can go to any of the nearby bars for a pre-dinner drink while you wait.", "author": "Nerri Y."}

Although i'm not much of a seafood person, I really love ordering the sea bass (instead of steak) with the wasabi noodles. The noodles - very thick, with hints of sesame, and a slight spicy touch to it - really complemented the sea bass. \n\nThe sea bass had such a rich flavor to it. The fish was very tender (almost as if it melted in your mouth) and this became my favorite meal at the house.\n\nAs for service and ambiance, I was pretty satisfied. The waiters and waitresses are dressed up and there's dim lighting which makes this a great date spot!", "author": "Julie N."}

We showed up and didn't have a reservation on a Saturday night. we had to wait for about 20 mins to be seated, so not bad. (we ogled other ppl's food till then and obviously checking yelp for photos).\n\nThe menu has something for everyone, really covers all the bases. its got veggies, meat(pork, beef, sometimes lamb), fish (halibut, sea bass) so you will find something to your liking. \n\nwe got green been tempura and Clams to start with, they are perfectly crispy and not battered heavily. liked it a lot, didn't care that much for the vinaigrette that it came with. Clams were awesome, came with toasted bread which you could dip in the scrumptious gravy. \n\nFor the entrees we got Pork chop and Halibut. \nFirst thing you see is the presentation and the quantity. They are huge, i love that. I feel like lot of fancy and top restaurant skimp on the quantity saying that a perfect bite is better that have a stuffing of a good portion. But there is not skimping at the House. You will be full after you eat here. \n\nThe taste: it was one of the better pork chops i have had, The pork chop was perfectly cooked and the pomegranate sauce with bits of pomegranate was perfection. Loved it. \n\nThe halibut came with i think sweet potato strings. the halibut was flaky and again perfectly cooked, and really packed with flavor. Loved it. \n\nI have heard a lot of good things about the sea bass so i will get that next time although its hard for me to deviate from the pork chop. \n\nJust get here and try it for yourself.", "author": "Anuj C."}

Came here on a Saturday night with a few friends around 5 PM. We didn't have a reservation, but since the restaurant had just opened there was plenty of seating and we were seated right away. \n\nThe House is very very very very SMALL. Emphasis on small. There are only a few tables, and even though you're sitting at different tables, it feels like you're literally bumping elbows with the people sitting at the table next to you. It's cozy though LOL. Decor and ambiance is very warm and cozy feeling, but still very chic. The staff is also very friendly and efficient! The service was excellent. \n\nThe menu included a lot of different items and the waitress also recited the specials to us when we got there. I sort of always hate that -- when they recite the specials instead of having it printed somewhere -- because I ALWAYS forget what the specials were/what's in it, etc. But the menu items were mid-level price range, ~$15-$35 depending on what you got.\n\nI ordered the grilled sea bass of course -- I needed to see what the hype was about. And our table ordered the scallops from the specials menu to share. It's $5 for 1 scallop, so we ordered 4. OK SO. SCALLOPS. SO FREAKIN DELICIOUS. They were probably the best scallops I've ever had. Pretty large, but a good one bite sort of deal for an appetizer. They were tender and perfectly cooked and flavored. The presentation was beautiful as well. Worth the $5 per scallop for sure. The sea bass came with green beans and garlic noodles. Overall the dish was delicious. The fish was cooked so perfectly. Like I am in awe of how soft and buttery and delicious the sea bass was. It astounds me how someone can cook fish like that. Because I definitely can't cook fish like that LOL. The garlic noodles were pretty good, but I love me some green beans. So they were a winner in my book. \n\nAll in all, I thought the food here was pretty delicious. I'm not a HUGE fan of semi-upscale Asian fusion food (hence the four stars instead of five). But definitely give this place a shot if you get the chance", "author": "Amy T."}

I had made reservations for 1pm, but arrived a bit earlier and was able to get seated before that time. Tip** parking might be hard to find in that area, especially on a busy Saturday! My dad had actually started leaning towards eating somewhere else less crowded but we ended up just parking near Pier 39 and walking to the restaurant - fortunately it was a nice walk and didn't feel long at all.\n\nWe started with a few appetizers (small plates) and then each got an entree. I have to say that everything was SO DELICIOUS. Every dish tasted so fresh and the seafood was cooked so well.\n\nDeep Fried Salmon Roll: This reminds me of an egg roll, but with salmon in it. The salmon tasted super moist and I liked the crunch of the wrap. I however can't handle spicy food and so the wasabi sauce was probably my least favorite part of the meal.\n\nAhi Tuna Poke with Avocado and Crispy Rice (one of their specials of the day): So good! The ahi tuna tasted really fresh and accompanied by the avocado and crispy rice (which reminds me of rice crispy cereal) was perfect. I only wish there was more to go around.\n\nMe: Unagi Avocado Sandwich ($14): I would definitely recommend getting this if you're a fan of the dragon roll. I really enjoyed this dish, especially the bread. The way they seasoned and toasted it was super good. This dish also came with a side salad.\n\nMom: Hokkaido Salad with seared scallop and shrimp: I had a taste of my mom's scallop and it was .... so good! (for lack of better words) \n\nDad: Wasabi warm noodles with grilled king Salmon: I also tried some of the noodles and a bit of the salmon and thought this dish was rather tasty as well.\n\nOur plates were clean by the end of this meal.

However we ordered a bottle of wine and it was at very warm temperature.  We asked the waiter twice to put the bottle to chill but he kept forcing us to drink it before it even reached a temperature we wanted.  With that, here comes their famous noodles with beef.  We ordered them medium and they the beef came quite rare.  We asked them to take it back to Cook and they made us put the beef in a separate plate so they can recook it.  Why would they not take our plate and cook the beef for us? I found that odd. At the end, place is alright, service was okay.

I'd compare it to a fresh sriracha sauce. We also had the scallops. They were seared perfectly; I tasted the char, yet the inside of the scallop still retained the raw ocean flavor. I would highly recommend both of those appetizers. For the main course we shared the sea bass with string beans and noodles.\n\nOur service was outstanding.

My girlfriend and I made reservations ahead of time and were seated by the window with a great view of the bustling city streets.  The ambiance was great.  The appetizers we ordered, the unagi and the mussels, blew us away.  They were the best appetizers we've had in a long time.  We ordered a nice, albeit overpriced, bottle of Riesling to accompany the meal.  \n\nWhen it came to the main course, we were extremely underwhelmed.  \n\nMy girlfriend ordered the steak atop \"wasabi\" noodles.  There was no detectable wasabi here, only red pepper, and the seasoning was just \"meh,\" salty and spicy but not much else.  The steak on top we ordered rare and rare, indeed, it came - complete with a huge gristly line of silver skin connective tissue running straight through the middle.  It was inedible and we didn't take the time to send it back for fear that all the meat selected in the kitchen was so terrible (not to mention it was just a bad dish composition in the first place!)  \n\nI ordered a special of the day, whitefish with a truffle cream sauce on top of mashed potatoes.  My first thought was that everything was rather bland and I could make better mashed potatoes at home.  There were some completely unseasoned fried cabbage sticks sitting on top.  The only redeeming quality of the dish was that the fish was well cooked, not overdone and nice and tender.  My girlfriend and I ate this together with sullen hearts.  \n\nA note to the management:  Would it kill you to get some new plates?  The white plates our food was served on looked like they had been around since World War 2, with plenty of knife scratches and weird discolorations from years of abuse and repeated washing.  \n\nTwo stars instead of one because I recommend you come here just for drinks and appetizers and then go elsewhere for some real food.", "author": "Julian W."}

However, I emphasize on the fact this is a fantastic Asian Fusion restaurant in the heart of San Francisco. Don't hesitate about where to take your wife or date or friends; just come here.  It's the best in SF area, hands down!. Fried Salmon roll is a MUST.\n\n\nExperience..\n\nMake sure you call for a reservation couple days in advance. Came here with newlywed, one of the greatest friends and his wife. Staff and waitresses are ever-smiling, hospitable and still chipper even for our late 9:15 pm reservation. Tables and chairs were clean, simple and non-extravagant. Your expectations are neutral if you just look at the atmosphere. It's a cozy and warm place with a family-owned vibe. \n\nSalmon Phenomena.. \n\nDeep fried salmon roll with Chinese hot mustard and roe is a MUST here. Ordered one and then had to ordered another one. We could've ordered 6 of these, finished dinner and left super happy. The taste of this roll is just phenomenal!. They were perfectly cooked, rare in the middle. Be careful not to pour too much of the hot mustard. Raging smoke will come out of your ears if you get too much of that sauce (like what happened with this dude). Seriously, you can eat only these salmon rolls and leave happy. \n\nEntrees..\n\n1- seared ahi with spicy mustard aioli on top of sticky rice\n2- ribeye steak with teriyaki, toasted garlic butter sauce\n3- pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce\n\nI tried the ahi and ribeye steak. The seared ahi was spectacular! It was the best ahi I've ever had. Ribeye was great, but between the awesome salmon roll and ahi, its thunder was stolen. \n\nPrices here are the most reasonable.  \n\nMy friend and his wife were super happy with the experience. My friend is a high class fastidious foodie and hearing how happy he was, made my night.. He paid for the food which makes anyone happy :).

And finally, over Christmas break we zipped up to the city just to get some good eats.  Found THE perfect parking spot, literally right in front of the restaurant door.  Love when that happens (never).   :)\n\nSmall place.  We knew that going in, but still it's difficult when you arrive you're being squeezed into a tiny spot between folk that are already eating.  Not the place for a quiet, romantic evening out.  And loud, very loud.  Very difficult to hear the server announce the specials.  Wow, I'm not old, but I sure sound like it.\n\nService was bare minimum.  I don't think our server checked back with us even once, but luckily we weren't in need.  The servers didn't strike me as experienced and everything felt so rushed.  No real time to talk about the menu and get opinions and recommendations.  This would be a great restaurant to come right at opening when they're not crazy busy.  That way, you could probably get some quality attention. \n\nWhat did we eat?\n\nDEEP FRIED SALMON ROLLS (5/5) These are bomb. Order these for sure, especially if you like salmon.\n\nGRILLED OCTOPUS (5/5)  Different from the way other restaurants serve it, this one had a sauce and was entirely tender and delicious.  Highly recommended.\n\nSEA BASS WITH GARLIC NOODLES (4/5)  My wife's dish.  She loved the sea bass.  She loved the fish more than the noodles. I thought the noodles were pretty good.  Thick, almost like udon.\n\nFLAT IRON STEAK WITH GARLIC NOODLES (3/5)  My daughter's dish.  She said it was not memorable, and that it's a steak you could get anywhere. She said the noodles were good, but again, nothing special.\n\nSHORT RIBS WITH MASHED POTATOES (4/5)  Not your average short rib dish.  It felt more like a tri-tip.  And it was served sliced, with a good amount of pink.  I was confused a bit when they asked me how I wanted my short ribs cooked.  Short ribs typically come braised or slow-cooked so sliced and pink came as a nice surprise.  I enjoyed the meat but the mashed potatoes were sorely lacking.  Served pretty much cold and lifeless.  Tasted like day-old Thanksgiving leftovers.\nNo thank you on the potatoes.\n\nTUNA POKE (3.5/5) Good but not great, somehow tasted too salty.\n\nCOCONUT CREME BRULEE (3/5) Good, but I had a problem with the consistency.  It was too loose for me and not strong enough on the coconut. And had a problem with the portion.  Like a 1/4 inch deep, what?\n\nTRUFFLE CHOCOLATE CAKE (4/5) If you're a dark chocolate fan, you will love this.  I'm not, but my wife and daughter are.  They raved and I let them eat it all.\n\nPERSIMMON PUDDING (5/5) Star of the desserts.  LOVED this. Rich and creamy, warm and inviting, full of persimmon flavor, big-time comfort food right here.  Inspired to make at home.  Kudos to the pastry chef. I hope this is still on the menu by the time you arrive!\n\nI think The House has the potential to be great.

Of course you can't forget the Seabass which is also a popular dish here and I definitely see why. It comes with noodles, sauteed green beans, and side of sauce (fish already has a lot of flavor so try not to drench it or it'll be too salty). The Pomegrante Pork Chops are also a must try!

The space is small but cozy, and service was very attentive and warm. I would give the restaurant 5 stars except for an issue with one of the dishes. \n\nOrdered the deep-fried salmon roll, unagi sandwich, and udon noodles. \n\nThe salmon roll was AMAZING and probably one of the best salmon dishes I've ever had. The roll itself is quite simple, but when you dunk the roll in the spicy mustard sauce, magic happens. Spicy feels all over in the good way. \n\nI tried udon noodles and was impressed at how clean and simple, yet deep and complex, the broth was. The chicken didn't end up over cooked which is always a worry in hot soups. \n\nThe unagi avocado sandwich was the major disappointment for me. I'm a lover of unagi anything, and was looking forward to it based on the rave reviews. But the concept of the dish is flawed - it treats the luscious unagi like deli sliced ham and crams it between thick bread and lettuce. Between the bread, tomato, and avocado, the eel got incredibly lost and the whole sandwich tasted like just a mushy sandwich. \n\nThe salmon roll will keep be coming back during my future trips to SF, next time I'll just avoid the unagi and try something else.", "author": "Constance C."}

It was pretty full when we arrived with a line forming as we got seated, so we were glad we made a reservation. We ordered the grilled unagi, warm wasabi house noodles, and sea bass. The sea bass was SO GOOD. The seared shell encased a buttery meat and I'd love to go back just for that. Its paired stir fry noodles were also quite good, but I didn't care that much for the beans. The grilled unagi is basically a deconstructed roll, and if you like lion king rolls (as I do!), the style of this is similar and worth trying. The house noodles were delicious, and the steak that it came with was decent, but I thought the contrasting flavors didn't pair well together.

The waiters were also awesome with the distribution of water as I had three glasses of water and they refilled it for me everytime without me having to ask. \n\nWe got the first two things on the mains menu (I'm pretty sure the menu changes often). I got the rice with mushroom and shrimp while my friend had the warm wasabi house noodles with steak. I LOVED the rice with mushroom and shrimp. The shrimp were large and cut nicely so that the whole tail is there and the shell was removed. The rice tasted like risotto and was sprinkled with dried bonito flakes.

It's like butter and the flakes were divine, not at all stale. \n\nSea bass and garlic noodles- the fish was prepared perfectly.

Garlic noodles were a bit heavy on the soy sauce or oyster sauce, and were udon noodles. \n\nRib eye, cauliflower, and mashed potatoes- again, they have an exquisite expertise in cooking meat. The meat was so tender and the fat was just a bit crispy, perfectly complimenting each other to not leave a very heavy grease taste in your mouth. Cauliflowers were flawless, in texture- perfectly cooked but still a bit crunchy and in flavor-so so delicious. \n\nTo top it off we had the pumpkin pie with Japanese custard/whip cream.

The restaurant has limited space, but was able to accommodate two large parties (6+ people) in addition to two and four-top tables. \n\nThere isn't much decor to the restaurant. The signage is very simple, there is a small house stamp on the place mat, and small pieces of Japanese art throughout the restaurant that aren't very noticeable. It's actually very minimalist, focusing on the food. The vibe is very casual here!\n\nfood\n+ CHICKEN VERMICELLI SALAD: As a starter, we were debating between this appetizer and the warm kale salad. I am so glad we started with this! The vermicelli noodles were light, accompanied with peanuts, chicken, cucumber and topped with nori. It was like a spring roll but in salad form!\n\n+ GRILLED UNAGI, AVOCADO SUSHI RICE: This is an amazing appetizer as well. The unagi is presented on top of the rice like a maki roll, but under the fish you'll find it is just a rectangular bed of rice topped with wasabi and avocado. It was simple, but I've never had unagi presented this way. \n\n+ SEARED AHI TUNA, SPICY MUSTARD AIOLI: Looking for a lighter dinner, we wanted a fish entree. The tuna was perfectly seared along the outside and soft in the middle. The chips on top added the perfect crunch and wasn't obnoxiously big to distract from eating the fish itself. \n\nAll of the dishes were simple, but executed really well. The Asian flavors were prominent, but not overpowering. Nothing was too salty or spicy, and everything was pretty light (at least our options were). \n\nservice\nThe restaurant gives a family-owned vibe, as there was no formal hostess or bussers. The same long, black-haired Asian woman greeted us at the door, asked us if we had reservations, sat us at our table, and cleared our table when we were done eating.

The Octopus had a great texture, probably the highlight of my meal. It was neither too tough nor too soft. Kind of that perfect balance you want with squid and octopus. It was served with deep-fried sweet potatoes and a few slices of avocado. Eating those three items together really rounded out the flavors and textures. We had the sea bass per the recommendation of other Yelp review, but I didn't find it too be as amazing as the hype. Still, it was a great dish. I've just had fish with more of the \"melts in your mouth\" quality in other restaurants. Overall, the food was delicious, not to get anything twisted. It just didn't have that \"wow factor\" I was hoping for. (Except for the Grilled Octopus appetizer. That was amazing!)\n\nService was very prompt and professional. No complaints there. Unfortunately, I didn't catch our servers name.", "author": "Ubi K."}

We arrived 5 minutes early, and waited maybe 10-15 minutes to be seated. The restaurant felt *almost* cramp with almost no waiting/standing area and the tables arranged quite close together. The decor was minimal and we were soon seated by a lovely waitress (unfortunately the other waitress we spoke with was slightly less lovely)\n\nWe were given a normal menu, a drink menu, and verbally told the day's specials. Personally, I am not a fan of verbal menus because restaurants are usually loud and I can't decide on/remember every item they recite. I listened closely, and kept my ears out for the black cod special. Unfortunately they were sold out! \n\nWe settled for the Sea Bass (with Garlic Noodles and Green Beans, which is not listed/described in the menu and I honestly can't say why they don't do so), the Scallop appetizer (one of the specials), and the Fried Salmon Roll appetizer.\n\nScallop appetizer: This was on the special menu that was verbally recited to us and I honestly don't remember the details anymore. These scallops were simply absolutely phenomenal and were definitely the best part of our entire meal. The aesthetic was on point, with the sauces dripped artistically on the plate, the 3 scallops arranged in a triangle, and a watermelon radish with green fish eggs (?) in the center of the plate. Also note that this dish cost $17, which we didn't know as the specials are recited without the price. If I had known this before tasting the scallops, I would not have ordered the dish. Even after tasting the scallops, I still find this ridiculous for the expected price point of this restaurant.\n\nDeep Fried Salmon Roll with Chinese hot mustard: This was a dish of 2 rolls cut in half on a bed of salad, paired with a hot mustard dipping sauce that provided the perfect amount of crunch and zing. Following the scallop appetizer, it was not mindblowing in any way, but the price was much more reasonable for a reasonably tasty appetizer.\n\nGrilled Sea Bass with garlic ginger soy, garlic noodles, and green beans: This was delicious! The sea bass had that buttery melt-in-your-mouth quality. It paired very well with the ginger soy dipping sauce, the noodles, and the green beans. The green beans were soft and perfectly seasoned. However, I have to say that the garlic noodles were my favorite part. The noodles were thick and chewy. I would have eaten an entire plate of just garlic noodles! \n\nOverall: The House is a small restaurant with simple decor. In comparison, the delicious Asian fusion food is quite extravagant. If money is not an issue, I highly recommended the Scallop appetizer special and the Grilled Sea Bass with garlic noodles. Otherwise, I would still recommended the Grilled Sea Bass! I would love to come back and try the Wasabi Noodles and Black Cod.", "author": "Vivian L."}

We were a party of seven and I guess the only availabilities for parties that huge are at 5:30pm or 9 (I forgot what they said exactly, but we could only stick with our 5:30pm reservation). It might be difficult to find parking around the area because it is in the city so I do recommend parking at the North Beach Parking Garage right across from the police station (0-1 hours is only $3). \n\nWe all ordered similar items on the menu. We started off with two orders of their deep fried salmon rolls and their calamari (it was one of the specials for the night). I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce for the salmon rolls. The wasabi flavor was too strong for me, but the rolls themselves were pretty good and crispy! The calamari was really good too! \n\nFor our entrees, we all got either the grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy as dip, kurobuta pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce, or the rib eye. The sea bass was so tender and tasted amazing with the sauce, garlic noodles, and green beans. The pork chop was MY FAVORITE. I wish I had gotten this as my original entree, but I only had a couple bites of my boyfriend's. Literally...it was perfect in flavor, in texture, in EVERYTHING. My brother was the only one who ordered the rib eye steak and I didn't get a chance to ask him how it was, but he seemed to enjoy it. I really liked how they didn't prepare his steak until he got there (he was 30 minutes late to dinner) to make sure it wasn't overcooked or too cold. Something I was truly amazed with was how fast they cooked everything. I swear the waiter had just taken our order and fifteen minutes later our food was here. Maybe it's because the restaurant is so small that they aren't backed up on so many orders? \n\nDefinitely a great place to celebrate a special occasion. I would love to eat here again and try other things on their menu!", "author": "Sydney C."}

Started with the half dozen oysters and shares the wasabi noodles and sea bass. I usually don't like cooked fish because of the fishy taste and how cooked fish leaves this sticky texture when it's too cooked but it did not taste fishy at all!

An explosion of flavors and the proteins are alway cooked perfectly. The chicken and pork are NEVER too dry and so moist and tasty. Definitely a must try in San Francisco if you're in the North Beach/Chinatown area.  I would recommend coming for lunch because it's a similar menu at a lower price point. Plus the restaurant is so small, it's less hectic and more casual during lunchtime. My favorite go tos are the wasabi noodles with pork and the curry udon with chicken. The sea bass is to die for!

I feel like I can count the number of times I've had actually good Asian fusion on one hand (and not using all of my fingers at that) because so often you find that it ends up as just a lackluster combination of inauthentic various Asian cuisines.\n\nThankfully, my dinner at The House was most definitely delicious, most definitely fusion, and most definitely worthy of our time there. I mean, I'm sure that my review will do very little to paint a picture different than that literally thousands of other amazing reviews on Yelp, but I'll break down what I had in case any of you are looking to take a trip:\n\nI started with the lychee black iced tea, which was delicious and had a nicely de-pitted whole lychee for me to fish out of the bottom. I also got a tsing tao beer because balance.\n\nFor our appetizer, we took Yelp's advice and went for the deep-fried salmon roll. It was oustanding, with a warm mustard sauce to drizzle or dip (however you like it), and just the right amount of crunch. I could have eaten five of these. Yum!\n\nFor my entree, I went with one of the specials mentioned, which was a miso black cod (or maybe a black miso cod, haha) served over choy with a slightly sweet sauce. It was beautifully cooked and super flavorful. \n\nI also got to try my friend's seabass (a classic dish here, I'm told), and it was perfect. Tremendously well-done, and I like the noodles that it was served with as well.\n\nI highly recommend making a reservation at The House, as it is teeny-tiny and many people got turned away or had to wait a long time. Our table was right next to the door so it got a little noisy, but our waitress was very attentive and we never felt rushed.\n\nThanks for an amazing meal, The House!", "author": "Gretchen F."}

I decided to give them another try for a Saturday dinner.  This time we were seated right at our reservation time, but the other problems were still present and in fact worse than before.\n\nI had reserved three weeks in advance but even so we were seated at the worst table in the house, right next to the door, cramped against a wood panel on the inside and in the pathway of entering diners on the outside. This wouldn't be so bad if they didn't allow the waiting patrons to crowd into the tiny entry way.  My husband, who had valiantly taken the outer seat, had to endure multiple bumps of his chair and person throughout the meal.  In addition, the door crowd added to the deafening din in the restaurant.\n\nHow loud you ask? So loud that I was completely unable to hear the server recite the long specials list.  Pleasant conversation was equally impossible.\n\nThe server did the bare minimum, not bothering to take drink orders until she was ready to take our food order (20 minutes after being seated). There's a busser, but for some reason all he does is drop off the first glasses of water. The server was busy clearing plates and re-filling water glasses while not taking our order.\n\nExcellent food + an unpleasant, uncomfortable atmosphere + sub-par service = not such a great meal.", "author": "Martha M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-04-11", "description": "Been meaning to eat at The House ever since it opened many years ago but the opportunity never arose until recently.  Was walking by at 5pm on a Fri, asked for a table and surprisingly they had one available.\n\nAs noted in other reviews, the space is VERY small and crowded.  Need to use the urban habit of ignoring your neighbors and their conversation even though they are only a foot away from you.  And, if you are a larger person, don't even think of trying to squeeze between tables to get to a seat along the wall; just take the seat on the aisle. There is only 1 bathroom and if you don't pick the right time to \"go,\" you could face a long line to get in to do your business.\n\nAs for the food, it was ok but not what I'd consider exceptional overall.  My GF and I shared a unagi appetizer which presented a long piece of eel placed on top  of what appeared to be a deconstructed sushi roll w/rice, avocado and a sauce that you would typically find adorning such a roll.  Nothing really special about it. \n\nMy GF had a shrimp salad w/pork rinds and I had the kale salad w/Pt. Reyes blue cheese and pistachios.  I liked the shrimp salad which was made w/shredded veggies (daikon and carrots among others I believe) and a light citrus dressing but the shrimp were cut into very small pieces and were frankly hard to find.  The fried pork skin added a nice crunch.  Didn't like the kale salad as much.  Too much oil dressed the cooked kale.  The pistachios were numerous but, like the shrimp, the blue cheese was almost invisible.\n\nFor the mains, my GF had a flat iron steak w/wheat noodle dish and I had sea bass w/wheat noodles and long beans.  We asked for the steak RARE assuming that it would come out overcooked (and hopefully, medium rare) instead BUT it actually came out RARE, which pleased me but not my GF so much.  I ate almost all the steak and it was good but I didn't care for the noodles or the sauce it came with.\n\nThe bass I got was cooked perfectly; buttery and delicious.  Again, didn't care for the noodles at all; bland and covered in too much oil.  Same for the beans; too much oil dressed them and they seemed bland and tasteless.  However, kudos for the bass which was the star of the dish.\n\nAdd a couple of glasses of white wine, tax and tip and it was a $140 meal.  Ok but not great.  Better than what you'd get at some other trendy North Beach establishments but you could fill yourself up on an equally greasy meal at one of the Chinese restaurants nearby for a fraction of the cost which is what I think we'll do the next time instead.\n\nIt was worth the opportunity to say that we've eaten there but, based on this experience, I don't think we'd bother going back again.", "author": "Martin C."}

Most of the dishes were 5 star dishes with a couple of 4 stars (although many other reviewers loved those dishes).\n\nThe restaurant is on the small side, so I'd recommend advance reservations if possible. We arrived promptly for our Saturday night, 6:30pm reservation. A table was there waiting for us. It's great when a reservation means you don't have to wait 10 minutes for a table.\n\nThe 3 of us split 3 appetizers and entrees and 1 dessert. We asked our waitress what the most popular dishes were and primarily went with those (mixed with a couple of specials of the day).\n\nAppetizers:\n1. Scallops ($18): 3 medium sized scallops (although I think they were described as \"large,\" they seemed more medium to me. However, I don't know enough about scallops so say that my size estimate is correct). This \"special\" was absolutely delicious. I've raved about the scallops at MB Post (in Manhattan Beach, CA) in the past; these were better. A bit pricey, but I'd order these again.\n\n2. Deep-Fried Salmon Roll ($13): Accompanied by a mustard sauce. Think of this as an eggroll stuffed with salmon. Nice crispy exterior. Unfortunately, this dish did not wow me and was my least favorite dish of the evening.  I just didn't find the deep frying as making it any better than a nice cedar plank salmon. \n\n3. Grilled Octopus ($16): Loved this. Tender pieces of octopus perfectly grilled and matched with a wonderful sriracha aioli. \n\nEntrees:\n1. Grilled Sea Bass ($31): This is one of their signature dishes. Unfortunately, I did not love it (it was good, but not something I would order again). Agree that is was perfectly cooked and the garlic ginger soy had nice flavor, but to me, was just not special. I did, however, really love the garlic noodles and thought the green beans were also very good. I will also mention that I typically don't order fish as I generally don't enjoy it as much as meat/poultry.\n\n2. Kurobota Pork Chop ($28): Loved this. Succulent, tender, flavorful. Pomegranate currant sauce was a wonderful alternative to apple-based sauces. The mashed potatoes were good, not extraordinary, but no complaints. My favorite dish of the meal.\n\n3. Kobe Short Ribs ($35): If you like kalbi, you'll love this special. All the same flavor as great kalbi, but incredibly tender. Served boneless over Chinese broccoli with a side of rice. Having said that, it's certainly very pricy. If you want the most tender kalbi ever, this is a winner. If you don't care about the premium price, go for it. But if you are basing solely on flavor and don't care about the chewiness at your typical Korean restaurant, then pass. Personally, I loved the dish but probably wouldn't order it again.\n\nDessert:\nBittersweet Chocolate Truffle Cake ($9): I was so full, that I had only a very small taste of this. Served with ice cream. I thought it was a nice dessert, but was surprised that the crust was not tastier. \n\nEven though it has been four days since I ate here, I still think about the great meal we had.

I finally got to come here to celebrate my and my mom's birthday with my family and boyfriend, after it being in my bookmarks since forever!!\n\nWe ended up getting 2 appetizers and 5 entrees to share. Sound like a lot of food...? It was!!! I got to try:\n\n- Deep fried salmon rolls: I really wanted to try these after seeing so many pics of them on yelp, and they did not disappoint! The salmon was cooked perfectly and was slightly rare in the middle, which I loved! The only thing I wish they had was a different dipping sauce because I don't like hot mustard. I probably could've asked but ehhhh\n\n- Seared scallops (this was a special!): The waitress told us this comes in orders of 3, so she added on 2 more for an additional fee. The scallops were beautifully seared and had the perfect bite!! I also really liked the lemon ponzu that came with it, and it all blended together really well. \n\n- Grilled ahi tuna: Another great dish!! Came with shredded taro chips on top and I really enjoyed those, I even started eating them with my fingers hahaha. Tuna was good quality and had a great sear on the edges. \n\n- American kobe skirt steak: This was a huge piece of meat!!!! Covered in fried garlic and cilantro so yummmm. Not my favorite of the night because nothing stood out to me, but the meat was still delicious and executed well.\n\n- Kurobuta pork chop: Tied with the seabass for my favorite dish of the night. Normally when you think of a porkchop, you think dry and tough. But this was the complete opposite!! So tender and easy to cut, and the pomegranate currant sauce was amazing!! I've never had meat with a fruit sauce, but this was sooo good. I ended up wiping the sauce with last few pieces of the meat, trying to get every last bit haha. Must order!!!\n\n- Grilled sea bass: Last but certainly not least... The famous sea bass!! The fish was so tender and flaky, and I even enjoyed the garlic noodles and string beans that came with it!! The garlic normals are not your usual PPQ/thanh long noodles, but are covered in a smooth garlic sauce. The garlic ginger soy poured on top of the sea bass really made the dish though. The sauce is slightly sweet and so flavorful!! We actually got 2 orders of this because we knew it was so good!!\n\nThe service was good as with any expensive restaurant, and the ambiance is open in the front but more dark and intimate in the back. This would be a great place for a date!! Except parking sucks haha.\n\nOverall I was very happy with my experience here!

We arrived around 6:20 and we were seated promptly once we walked up to the counter and asked.\n\nWe started with the Salmon Rolls since we had read on Yelp that they were amazing. I'd warn that the mustard sauce contains wasabi and definitely gives you that sting. That being said, neither my boyfriend or I are a fan of wasabi but we both liked the dish.\n\nWe split the Sea Bass and Pork Chop for our mains. The sea bass was grilled to perfection - crispy on the outside with an inside that just melts in your mouth. The green beans that came with the sea bass were delicious as well, and the garlic soy sauce was a great accompaniment. \n\nI usually wouldn't choose to order pork but I loved the Pork Chop dish as well. The presentation was gorgeous and every bite was cooked to perfection. The pomegranate sauce was just slightly sweet and went very well with the meat.\n\nWe ordered the Chocolate Macadamia Tart with coffee ice cream for dessert. The texture was similar to a thick brownie, with generous portions of macadamia nut mixed in. A delicious end to our meal.\n\nMy only complaint is that the restaurant is small - I ran into a friend but could barely say hi to her since there wasn't any space by her table. There is also only one bathroom for the entire restaurant. The ambiance is homey, but the food tops anything I've had at fancier establishments.\n\nWe'll surely be back!", "author": "Anna M."}

Interesting combo- would order it again. \nWasabi Noodles with steak: yes, yes, YES. I'm not a huge fan of wasabi and was scared to try this dish initially, but ended up loving it. There is only a hint of wasabi on the noodles. \nMushroom rice with bonito flakes and ...?: Good, but not memorable (I can't even remember what was in it). \n\nWe made a last minute reservation around 5PM on a Saturday night and the only available reservation was 10PM.

It came with cauliflower and mashed potatoes. The sauce was extremely flavorful and had a strong truffle taste.

We had made reservations for 8pm on a nice Saturday evening. We checked in early and were seated before 8pm. Seating is cramped and this is not a very large restaurant so you're almost elbow to elbow with the table next to you. Since it's pretty compact space, conversations from the other tables will carry across tables.\n\nI went with the Wasabi House Noodle with Angus Flatiron Steak entree, and we also shared the Grilled shrimp salad. The salad had crispy pork skin bits to give the salad a nice crunch and the flavors were mild and blended well together. For my entree, the wasabi noodles had a subtle wasabi kick and the flatiron steak was a bit bland for my tastes.\n\nOverall, service was what you should expect, prompt and quick, but not overly warm.

Next our server made an excellent suggestion of fried soft shell crab which was beautifully presented and comes with a side of cold pasta. The dipping sauce made the dish and we asked for more to pour over the entree. We also had jasmine tea on the side as a palate cleanser and it was fragrant and subtle.\n\nEntree: We had the mushroom rice and shrimp and the sea bass with noodles. Wow! Both were excellent. The grilled shrimp had a perfect grilled, almost tandoori style flavor, and the rice was very good. Huge portion. The sea bass...wow...I would order that again next time. The fish was melt-in-your-mouth buttery and the sauce paired with it was superb. Also loved the garlic noodles on the side.\n\nDessert: The creme brulee was excellent with a citrus orange sugar crystal top.

They don't serve cocktails here, only beer and wine, but the food was fabulous!  The scallops were cooked perfectly and so flavorful - I was sad I didn't get a plate for myself.  I ordered the sea bass, which came with thicker noodles and green beans - the fish was moist and tender and I liked the sweet soy based sauce that came on the side.  I'm missing the photo of the Rib Eye for some reason, but it was larger than we thought it would be ($35 I think).  It was also a tasty piece of meat.  The fried black cod was also prepared well, though I preferred the sea bass.  The only average dish was the Ahi - it was a little overcooked and dry.

Since then, the movement has shifted to California modern (whatever that may mean). Where many have faltered, The House is alive and well. I'm not sure how often they update their menu, but all their dishes, from the appetizers to the entrees, were solid. A quick rundown of my dinner:\n\n- Deep-fried salmon roll with Chinese hot mustard: This could have been better if my salmon wasn't thoroughly cooked on the inside. From the looks of some of the pictures, it should be pink. Otherwise, nice mustard.\n- Caesar salad with crispy scallops: Nice pairing of scallops with a classic salad.\n- Unagi with avocado, sushi rice: This was my favorite appetizer. Unagi was on point with flavor and texture. \n- Seared scallops with ponzu sauce: A nice addition to the menu topped off with watercress.\n- Charred octopus salad: the octopus was tender and I loved the accompanying sauce.\n\nSome of the entrees are synonymous with this restaurant. One is the Kurobuta pork chop with pomegranate currant glaze. This dish is spectacular. I couldn't get enough of the pomegranate sauce and the pork was cooked to perfection. I'm not a fan of pork chops,  but this one hit the spot. The other two are fish dishes, the grilled sea bass and the miso cod special. Of the two, I loved the cod, which I found to be more flavorful and tender. Interestingly, it was topped off by a California roll with real crab meat.\n\nThe service was excellent and they have a great selection of import beers.

My coworker and I had a reservation at 12 and we got seated as we arrived. \n\nOur server went over the today specials and handed us the menu. No one came back to take our order for a good 10 mins, and it wasn't even busy. We finally ordered. My coworker ordered wasabi noodles with pork. I ordered curry noodles with flat iron steak medium rare. Server did not write this down as she probably remembers. Then we sat around, no water no nothing. Wasn't until I waved down this other lady who might have been the owner for water that they gave us water. \n\nFinally our entrees arrives, however they got my coworkers wasabi noodles with pork correct. Then when they handed my plate to me it was wasabi noodles with flat iron steak. I instantly told the server. This is not what I ordered. I ordered curry noodles with flat iron. She then says oh okay, let me go check. She walls back to the kitchen, comes right back and says this is what you ordered wasabi noodles with steak. I repeat myself to her no this is not what I ordered. I ordered CURRY noodles with steak. Then she goes on saying this is the house noodles with steak. At this point I'm really frustrated already as I have to repeat myself for the third time. I ordered CURRY noodles, not wasabi and not the house noodles but curry. Then she got confused again and went to the server who took my order. I repeat again what I ordered and she said oh ok we will make the new one for you. \n\nGeez, first of all you took my order down wrong, maybe you should write it down ? And then after getting it wrong, your coworker seems to be so confused and can't even differentiate between wasabi noodles and curry noodles and I have to repeat over and over and she still don't seem to get it. And even after saying they will make my original order, there's no even apology for getting my order wrong or anything ?!\n\nThat completely ruined my mood and I didn't even feel like eating much after. Anyhow, I finished most the plate and asked for the check. When she brought the check over she didn't even bother to say thank you or anything. \n\nDon't know whether these 2 servers are new or what not but that is definitely some poor customer service. Took a while to take our orders, no water served or bother asking what would we like to drink, getting my order wrong and when I tell her that it is incorrect she can't even admit to being wrong and kept insisting that is what I ordered, did not even apologize at all, and finally when bringing the check can't even say thank you. After all this, this would most likely be my last time dining here. Food is decent but with that kind of service, I probably won't even have the appetite to eat.", "author": "Rosanna K."}

How any restaurant can pull off \"Asian Fusion\" is beyond me, but The House did it with flair. The entrees we ordered were perfectly cooked. We ordered the sea bass and pomegranate pork chop. Both are must tries in my book! The sea bass were so tender and flaky, and the accompanying beans and noodles made this a really homey yet innovative dish. The pomegranate pork chop was fantastic. It was cooked to a perfect medium, and it was also very tender and bursting with flavor. The mashed potatoes it came with were very plain, but the actual star of the dish, the pork chops, more than made up for it. The fried salmon roll appetizers were a disappointment for me though. Was very unmemorable and boring. but my bf enjoyed it. Our meal ended with the chocolate truffle cake with coffee ice-cream and coconut caramel syrup which was also delicious :)\n\nMy only gripes with this place is that the bathroom was not very nice, and the tables were very cramped together.

THE BEST. We loved every single dish that landed on our table. This spot is an absolute gem - here is what I ate.\n\nShrimp & Chinese Chive Dumplings. I would slap babies for these dumplings, I'm serious. They were filled with noticeably delicious, fresh ingredients and the dumpling wrapper was perfect - not too thick and not too thin. All of the dishes are garnished with different types of radish so that crunch was a nice compliment to the soft steamed dumpling. But, the sauce. Da sauce that came with the dumplings was divine. I saved the sauce and dipped everything I ate it in - that's how good it was. The sauce was a soy sauce and green onion base and that seems simple but it was perfectly acidic with the right amount of vinegar.\n\nWe also started with a special appetizer that's not on the menu. Seared scallops with micro greens. These were unique because most of the time seared scallops are only seared on the two flat sides, but these were seared all the way around. They were perfectly cooked. I am not sure what the yellow sauce was but it was good but not the star of the plate. I actually don't remember exactly what the sauce tasted like. It was lightly sweet which complimented the savory flavor of the scallop but I liked the fact that the flavor was secondary and forgettable.\n\nI had two appetizers for my entree because if you've read my blog before you know I can't choose just one thing. The Mussels and The Deep Fried Salmon Roll with Chinese Hot Mustard. The mussels were in a tomato based broth with tiny pieces of tomato and onion. I could have drank the stuff. They were savory and the flavors were really developed. The fried salmon was crispy and perfectly cooked which I know is really difficult. That part of the dish wasn't extremely special but the DA SAUCE - it was amazing. It was spicy and the flavor went perfectly with the salmon. I also mixed the dumpling and hot mustard sauces because yolo  - do it.\n\nThis is one of my favorite new restaurants in the city, hands down. I will now recommend it to every visitor of SF in my network.

The tables were full and a few walk ins were crowding the entrance waiting for seats to clear up.\n\nWe got seated towards the back after a short wait. The tables are tiny and closely next to each other, so expect to have a cozy meal. The d\u00e9cor is minimal and it can be a little loud in there, but who cares when the food is so good!\n\nWe're more of red wine drinkers, but they did not have many by the glass options however the pinot noir turned out to be perfect. For starters we chose the deep fried salmon rolls and the steamed mussels in shrimp broth. I've been dreaming about the deep fried salmon rolls before even trying them just from pictures of it and they tasted even better than I expected! It has a nice crunchy outside, almost like an eggroll but the salmon inside was so soft. The Chinese hot mustard dipping sauce was a little strong, but with the right amount it made the perfect pair. The mussels were good, but not really outstanding.\n\nI ordered the seabass with garlic noodle and green bean sides with no hesitation based on all the hype from previous reviews. The seabass was a slightly flaky on the outside and each juicy piece really melted in my mouth...so good! I enjoyed it even more with the garlic ginger soy sauce on the side. The garlic green beans were cooked perfectly and the noodles complimented the whole meal real nicely. I seriously had to tell myself to slow down and eat smaller portions at a time otherwise I would've finished my plate before my bf, which rarely happens. It was too tasty and I pretty much cleared out my plate haha.\n\nMy bf had the kobe beef ribeye with the mashed potatoes and cauliflower sides. It was a huge cut and he asked for it medium rare. The first bite from the edge seemed to be a little cooked passed medium rare, but it turned out to be perfect. It was super flavorful and juicy.\n\nEverything was very delicious and I now know why this place is always packed (aside from it being small). I highly suggest it if you're in for a nice dining experience--I feel that some restaurants don't do Asian Fusion well, but this place has mastered it tying in all the right, unique flavors. Not too fancy, but definitely a treat! The only thing I regret was not trying anything from the dessert menu (what was I thinking!)

At $31 it's over priced - but hey it's San Francisco and let's face it - this isn't a place you frequent regularly. I've dined there three times now - most recently this evening. The tempura salad was a nice surprise - and unique menu item; I highly recommend. Ordered the fried salmon rolls app and they were not as good as I remembered / very dry (actually looking at pictures other diners posted I see that ours looked nothing like it was supposed to. Ours was not rare - it was fully cooked and chewy.) The wasabi sauce helped moisten things up and my friends didn't seem to notice. Next time I would pass on this one. The rhubarb strawberry pie was a perfect dessert. I wasn't as thrilled with the mango creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. The mango flavor was overpowering - the dessert looked like it was swimming in mango juice. Would have been better in my opinion if it was just a hint of mango. As far as ambiance, you'll be sitting elbow to elbow with the diners at other tables (my first dinner here we actually had a group convo our entire meal with the table sitting next to us).  It's also loud AF in there - the waitress repeated the specials twice and I still couldn't decipher what she was saying. Perhaps put them on paper? Service was annoyingly very rushed for some reason for a Monday evening. The waitress cleared away wine glasses when we still had wine in the bottle. Odd. Don't want to deduct stars for service but just slow it down please - we are paying good money to eat here!

Definitely a great way to start your meal.\n\nMiso black cod and CA rolls -\u00a0it sounds weird, but it's definitely tasty. The cod is cooked perfectly and sits on a stack of Chinese broccoli. The sauce is flavorful (might be a tad bit salty, but I enjoy it!).

I was always annoyed with how many people bombarded the streets as they waited for their name to be called in order to be seated. This time, I went directly to The House. It was time to see what the hubub is all about. \n\nWe made reservations beforehand, but even when we walked in at around 12:15pm, the place wasn't entirely packed. (Maybe because it's a Wednesday). Anywho, we were seated near the back and I found it pretty dark and I couldn't help but feel extremely sleepy. I had to keep drinking tons of water in order to stay awake. \n\nWe started our lunch with the fried string beans and mussels. The beans had a nice crunch due to the light layer of fried batter. The mussels were okay, but the sauce is what really made it for me. We ordered a side of bread in order to soak up what was leftover. \n\nFor entrees, we had the wasabi noodles with salmon, chicken with mashed potatoes, and sea bass with garlic noodles and green beans. The wasabi noodles had an interesting taste. A hint of spice and a lingering seasoning of wasabi. The salmon was spiced and cooked to perfection. The chicken was juicy and tender and the mashed potatoes reminded me of Thanksgiving. The sea bass was also cooked perfectly. It had a nice texture that complimented my crunchy green beans really well. The garlic noodles wasn't garlicky enough, but it was still extremely delicious.\n\nWe ended our meal with an a la mode, mango tapioca pudding and a creme brule. Everything was extremely delicious! Nothing was too sweet and the texture of the desserts were perfect. I would recommend all of them!", "author": "Linda K."}

Everything about the service to the flavor of each dish puts you in a great mood for the rest of the day. Each dish has a simple ingredient that somehow elevates your taste buds to another level and leaves you wondering how did they do that? The rice flakes in their poke, the wasabi dip with the deep fried salmon roll, and the corn in the curry noodles are all great examples of this.  I highly recommend ordering the deep fried salmon roll, curry noodles with grilled chicken, and wasabi noodles with grilled pork, which were all $12-13. The ahi-tuna poke, also a must try, was a lunch special so listen to all of their specials of the day ($16)!", "author": "Kevin T."}

Definitely a must try, though I wish they offered a larger portion.\n-Deep fried salmon rolls: Saw everyone ordering this on Yelp so we had to try it. We were a table of 6 and the rolls only come in 4 pieces. The kitchen was nice enough to accommodate for all of us by cutting the rolls into 6 instead of 4 pieces! Extra star for that :)\n\nEntree:\n-Warm wasabi noodles with angus flatiron steak: Noodles have a strong wasabi flavor, and the steak was grilled to a perfect medium rare. The portion was just right (though I did end up taking home the leftovers!). \n-Sea bass with green beans and garlic noodles: My friend ordered this so I didn't try the sides, just the fish. The fish just melts in your mouth, so delicious. The sea bass itself was pretty big sized. I've been to restaurants that serve fish as an entree and it's as small as half my palm so this was definitely a crowd pleaser! \n\nDesserts:\n-Coconut creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e with grapefruit pur\u00e9e: this dessert is a MUST try. The cream is so silky, br\u00fbl\u00e9ed to the perfect crisp. The tartness of the grapefruit pur\u00e9e eaten alone is extremely sour, but it pairs wonderfully with the sweetness of the creme. And it's a huge portion, wish I had the stomach space to finish it!\n-Pineapple upside down cake: this was one of their special desserts. TO DIE FOR. The cake is soft and moist, and pairs so well with the fresh pineapple and vanilla ice cream. \n\nOverall:\nThis restaurant is pretty pricey, and you have a two hour limit.

But thanks to Miriam W planning ahead, we had a dinner reservation for 7pm at The House to look forward to, and it did not disappoint.\n\nWe arrived a bit early for the reservation and the restaurant was bustling.  I hear this is often the case at The House, so reservations are indeed required.  We waited a few minutes for our table to open up and then settled into a cozy spot in the middle of the restaurant, perfect for our party of three.\n\nService was attentive enough.  Our waitress went over the specials, ensured we had water, and gave us sufficient time to look over the menu and decide what to order.  We decided to order family style and share...  We started with the Deep Fried Salmon roll and Unagi as appetizers, followed by The House's signature Wasabi Noodle with Steak and Black Cod special entrees.  (The Unagi and Black Cod were the winners in my eyes!)  We also shared a bottle of Viogner, many laughs and some memorable conversations.  \n\nI almost forgot... we ended the meal sharing the Mango Tapioca, which was the perfect sweet ending to the evening.

The House IS indeed my favorite SF restaurant. I love that the ambiance is so simple and unassuming. Nothing about it tries hard at all. The House lets the dishes speak for its name. \n\n+ deep fried salmon roll - Ok I know it doesn't SOUND appetizing. I was expecting a Philadelphia roll-esque mayo/cream cheese-filled sushi roll deep fried in tempura batter... gross. This appetizer is far from it. It's like a .... salmon egg roll. Simple. Flavorful moist salmon wrapped in a crispy eggroll exterior and topped with salmon roe. Served with a yellow wasabi sauce. A must.\n\n+  sea bass with noodles and green beans - SEA BASS is on hit. So fluffy and buttery and just melts in your mouth. and the garlic soy sauce with the noodles was the perfect side. I don't even know what to say except YOU HAVE TO ORDER THIS and experience it yourself. Words can't describe.... Drool.\n\n+ wasabi noodles with steak -Another stellar dish. OBSESSED with the wasabi noodles. The steak was flavored and cooked to a perfection. \n\n+ miso black cod - One of their specials of the day. Cod was (you guessed it) cooked to a perfection and  served with an AMAAAZING SAUCE. Topped with a slice of a California hand roll. Why did the California roll taste so bomb? I have no idea, but it is so next level. \n\nI was seriously wow'd by every dish. Decently priced and so bomb. I vow to ALWAYS visit the House when I'm in the City.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-16", "description": "Wow. where do I start with this place?\n\nThis place started simple enough, a humble location with a well decorated interior. Nothing crazy.\n\nNow to start off with the food, I'll begin with the appetizers.\n\nThe first thing we got was the baked salmon roll. This dish was very solid and tasty. The salmon was clearly very fresh, and every ingredient was well thought out. The horse radish sauce was really good as well. The flavor was not anything mind blowing, but was solid.\n\nThe second thing we got was the cooked octopus dish. Now this is where it got really crazy. After the first appetizer I thought I had my mind wrapped around what kind of a place this was, boy was I wrong. This appetizer was incredible. I mean seriously mind blowing. I have not tasted anything close to this in my life. It was asian inspired, along with some sweetness and bbq to go along with it. I only had octopus once before, but this time simply blew my mind apart. Everyone at my table's eyes opened wide after tasting this dish. In addition the octopus was extremely fresh, wasn't too chewy, and cooked to perfection without being too much dry. \n\nAfter the roller coaster that was the second appetizer, we entered the entree.\n\nWe each ordered 3 different entrees, which I got the liberty of tasting each. We got the pork chop, the seared ahi tuna, and the rib eye. Between my group of friends, my friend and I agreed that the rib eye was the best, while my other friend decided that the pork chop was the best.\n\nNow for the rib eye. Oh boy... \n\nAfter the octopus, I had no clue what to expect. The salmon started off good, but still within expectations, and the octopus went above and beyond. I didn't know what to expect. When my steak arrived, the first thing I notice was how gorgeous the plate looked. What I also liked at first glance was that aside from being very visually appealing, it looked like a good sized entree. Aside from portion size, it smelled and looked incredible. Also being an asian inspired dish, it was made with a house-made teriyaki sauce, with toasted garlic butter on top. This thing was seriously a good-looking piece of meat. It even glistened when I took a picture of it, I swear it was sent to me by the heavens.\n\nAs I cut into it, I notice it was cooked a perfect medium-rare (just how I asked). This was already a fantastic indicator. The meat was also super tender to cut through. The first bite of this mystical piece of meat was something for the storybooks.\n\nThe first thing that I remember hitting my mouth was the steak marinated in teriyaki. Oh my god, this is not regular teriyaki keep in mind. This is there own version which is extremely delicious, yet gentle as to not kill the flavor of the meat. The next that hit was the beef flavor, which was cooked to perfection, and finally the garlic. This single piece of meat tasted better IN MY OPINION than Mastro's Steakhouse, Flemings, and other restaurants of the such. The reason is because this place truly added a unique flair that really brought the steak to the next level.\n\nI was so enthralled by the steak that I could barely pay attention to the other dishes, being the pork chop and the ahi tuna. \n\nThe pork chop was also extremely good with pomegranate currant sauce which once again was good but not overpowering. This entree was arguably as good as the steak, but I would pick the steak over this personally.\n\nThe ahi tuna was also cooked perfectly, but in my opinion didn't have the same wow effect as these two other entrees.\n\nFinally was the dessert, which was a apple crumble. It was a solid dessert, with everything being cooked perfectly. Nothing crazy was really happening here, it was just very well made and tasted great. The apples were cooked perfectly, the ice cream had a good texture and flavor, and the breading was moist and flavorful. Best of all the dessert wasn't too sweet, and it was easy to continue eating this dessert.\n\nOverall this meal combined great service, EXCEPTIONAL food, and a nice ambiance and therefore deserves and easy 5 stars in my book.", "author": "Yanir R."}

If you can, try to come here with at least a party of four so that you can sample more things because everything on the menu looks that good.\n\nWe had no reservation, the restaurant was packed so we were told it would be about a 45 minute wait.  Less than 10 minutes later a party of two is gone, they call the next name, that party isn't in front of the restaurant, the hostess was too lazy to call the name again so \"BAM!\" we got a table just like that.   Awesome.  This was the last stop on our one day whirlwind tour of San Francisco and we were hoping to finish it off right.\n\nPickled Cucumbers - Complementary, a palate cleanser.  Sweet, sour, vinegar, sesame seeds.\n\nDeep Fried Salmon Roll with Chinese Hot Mustard - A must get.  Fresh, fatty glistening salmon wrapped in seaweed then wrapped in an egg roll skin and deep fried. It further tempts you with black roe on top. The Chinese mustard sauce is nose clearing, but a little sweet too, like they might have mixed some miso in.  Whatever it is, the combination is tongue orgasmic.  Comes with red cabbage slaw (that you should eat it with to get all the flavors).\n\nWarm Wasabi Noodles with Angus Flat Iron Steak - The flavor of the steak was good, but it came out more pink and rare than the medium rare we ordered. It came with their signature red cabbage slaw and thick wasabi noodles.  The noodles are good, I could eat a whole plate of just that.  Sweet soy, but with wasabi kick.\n\nGrilled Sea Bass with Garlic Ginger Soy (and Garlic Noodles) - This dish came with green beans and thick Garlic Noodles.  The sea bass was grilled just right, with a few char lines on the outside, was firm but tender and fresh with buttery juices that just melted away in my mouth.  Pretty much perfection.\n\nLet's pause for the great noodle debate.  Garlic or Wasabi Noodles?  Both use the same thick noodles that sop up the juices of what they are cooked in so well.  The sea bass was better than the steak.  The wasabi noodles just barely edged out the garlic noodles as our favorite.  You cannot go wrong with either.  You can go wrong if you don't have some noodles in one of your dishes.\n\nLichee Black Iced Tea - This was the most plain thing that we ordered.  If it was infused, I didn't taste it.  I think it was simply black iced tea with a lychee dropped in it.  If you want iced tea, it's fine.  If you were expecting lychee sweetness, you'll barely taste that, if at all.\n\nCoconut Creme Brulee with Passionfruit Puree - I love creme brulee.  I love coconut.  I almost creme brulee'd in my pants before the dessert came out.  It was so good.  So so good.  And it's a large portion for $7, enough for two people to share.  I would just come here for dessert all the time if I lived in the area.\n\nThe House is a small place.  It's nice, dimly lit but not fancy inside.  You'll question if this is romantic and intimate enough for a date, but once that first dish hits and that fork gets lifted, you'll know you won her heart.  What I loved was that each sauce had a purpose, with many layers to accentuate its dish.  You will be distracted by all the sexy dishes being served around you... that's a good thing as it'll help you expand your choices.   If you get flustered and overwhelmed, let your servers be your guide, as they are knowledgable about all the dishes, alert and efficient.

Our waiter was very kind and efficient, even though it was busy.\n\nWe started with the Kobe Beef Lettuce Cups and the Salmon Rolls. We personally really liked the Kobe Beef Lettuce Cups - the different components worked well together, though it looked very difficult to eat at first, and made for a great appetizer. The fried Salmon Rolls were pretty good and unique as well.  Nicely presented.  \n\nThe sea bass was perhaps slightly overdone, but the dish's soy ginger flavor was pleasant and I enjoyed it.  Some other reviews say this is served with mashed potatoes (which I think I would have preferred), but this dish was served with udon noodles.  The green beans were nice and green, as well as slightly crunchy, which is good if you like that.  The wasabi noodles were served with ahi tuna on this menu.  These noodles were also prepared with udon noodles and the flavor just didn't pop or stand out, though it seemed well-done overall.  The ahi tuna was cooked right, but could have been seasoned more.  The protein just didn't seem cohesive with the rest of it. \n\nThe dessert we got was the bittersweet chocolate bread pudding, which was probably the best of the night.  When I like a dessert that is not very sweet, that's saying something!  We thought it was delicious and would recommend it.\n\nOverall, we didn't think The House quite lived up to all of the hype.

Having recently experienced some sub-par sea bass at another restaurant, I was a bit hesitant, but I would happily come back here EVERY WEEK just for this! The skin was perfectly crisped, and the fish and sauce went together perfectly! Honestly, the fish was so amazing by itself that I wouldn't have even noticed if there were no sides or sauce, and that's really how all fish should ever be cooked from now until the end of time. My date ordered the pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce, and ate every last bite! \n\nNow for the only two things that were so-so in my opinion: lychee iced tea and bittersweet chocolate truffle cake a la mode. While it was kinda cool to have a lychee in my tea, it would've been nicer to really taste it in there too. As for the truffle cake, it was plenty fine, I just didn't have that crazy desire to finish every last bite, especially with all the flavors of the coffee ice cream mixing with the coconut caramel sauce. Overall, AMAZING meal, and it's rare that I leave a restaurant as satisfied as this!", "author": "Christine L."}

The House offers Asian fusion fare. I am always a little bit hesitant when it comes to Asian fusion because I simply am not a fan of the marriage between these two types of cuisines. From my past experiences, the dishes always end up being a little too sweet, or all of the flavors are compromised to create a heap of confusion on a plate.\n\nI think that the food at The House defines what Asian fusion should taste like. \n\nMy dining companion and I ordered the best hits of the menu:\n\n-deep fried salmon rolls: This appetizer is simply fatty salmon rolled up into a wonton type wrapper, deep fried and served with a hot Chinese mustard dipping sauce. The salmon is generous in portion and I really enjoyed the hot Chinese mustard. Gave the dish an extra level of flavor.\n\n-warm wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak: the warm noodles had a tinge of wasabi so the flavor wasn't too overpowered. The paired well with the perfectly cooked, medium rare angus steak. Oh so good.\n\n-grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy: This was definitely the best dish of the night, hands down. The garlic ginger soy really complemented the sea bass which speared into perfect, flakey morsels. This dish was divine.\n\nThe House is one of those San Francisco staples that everyone should try at least once. The menu may not rotate often, as with the growing trend in the restaurant scene, but what the menu does offer is refreshing. It's a nice step outside of the New American dining menus that San Franciscan restaurants heavily favor.", "author": "Trung N."}

The octopus was okay, seemed slighlt on the salty side to use. \n\nMain courses: Sea bass - like others have said, the sea bass is great. Ours was cooked perfectly and the sides were nice.

Tasty nonetheless. Came with a white wasabi-like sauce so be warned! \n\nFlat iron steak with wasabi noodles: steak was chewy and not too seasoned. Wasabi noodles alrite - wasabi taste wasn't too strong. Came with slicely thinned cucumbers, radishes, etc.\n\nSeabass with garlic noodles and green beans: LOVED! Fish perfectly cooked and flaky, noodles amazingly flavorful, and beans delish! MUST GET THIS DISH!!\n\nNotes:\n\n1. Make reservations!!! If not you're probably going to wait 90 mins or more\n2.

The food is amazing and very high quality, and I have never been disappointed.\n\nSmall Dishes:\nGrilled Octopus - The octopus is so good! I've had it multiple times, and it's very fresh each time. I also really like the (slightly spicy) sauce that serve on top.\nFried Salmon Roll - This is not like \"sushi\" roll but more like an eggroll with salmon inside. Very delicious, and the dip is very good too, with a very light hint of wasabi. \n\nMain Dishes:\nPork Chop - My favorite main dish. The pork is so tender and extremely well cooked. Flavor is perfect as well-- not too salty, which can be the case sometimes with pork chop. I really like the cranberry sauce it's served with and the mashed potatoes and the display is also super cute with the yam chips.\nWasabi Noodles with Skirt Steak - So good as well. The noodles are the thick Shanghai-type noodles, which I really like, and the flavor is great, with a little bit of spice!\n\nThe dishes might seem pricey but are totally worth it, especially with the huge portions! When my mom and I came here, we split two small dishes and a main dish, and when my boyfriend and I ordered a small dish and two main dishes, it was more than enough.\n\nService is great as well, attentive but not overly so. Definitely make reservations; the restaurant is small. I had tried to make reservations the night before, but they were booked completely up until 9pm. They open at 5:30, and we went in a 5:30, and we were able to get a table right away, but the restaurant was already almost filled then! \n\nThis place is also great for a casual catch up or a nice occasion, great for dates too! :)", "author": "Tiffany J."}

But by the end of the night, we all left frustrated and unsatisfied with our evening. Let me present you with the good, the bad, and the ugly.\n\nTHE GOOD: They were able to add two additional people to our reservation the night before. We were all very satisfied with the food (the sea bass was very fresh and the garlic noodles were well flavored). The staff was attentive with refilling our water. \n\nTHE BAD: We had two people that were running late, but the server kept coming back and asking if we were ready to order, when we were clearly still waiting for the rest of our party. Once one more person came in, the waiter came quickly over to take our order, not even giving the chance for that person to look over the menu. We brought in our own birthday cake and candles and asked for a lighter. Sounding very rushed, the waiter asked if we were okay with the cake fee without mentioning the cost of the fee. I didn't think a cake fee can be too bad, so I said okay. However, when we got the bill, the fee came out to be $18. WHAT. $18 for them to cut and serve a tiny cake is absolutely ridiculous! \n\nTHE UGLY: With that said, we reduced our tip because we felt the service was subpar and it absolutely should not cost $18 to serve a cake that I purchased myself. The waiter came back out with the bill and had the audacity to say \"Do you have something you want to say to me? It is customary to tip.\" EXCUSE ME?! We never said we were not going to tip, and I have never experienced a waiter asking for their tip. That is the exact reason why we felt like their service is unacceptable. The waiter was cold and extremely rude, making us feel very unwelcome. I am appalled by how unprofessional this waiter was.\n\nOverall, this waiter has damper the evening for all of us, especially as this was suppose to be a birthday celebration.

Since it was Xmas week, the place was bustling, but we were able to be seated within 10 minutes because we had made a reservation on Open Table.\n\nFirst off, the place is quite small. In fact, when we arrived we had to crowd into the corner of the space just to be able to close the door to the entrance. Following that trend, the four of us were seated at a small table that was placed between a couple of larger tables, which made for a compact dining experience.\n\nWe had eaten not too long before this meal so we decided to get some appetizers and main plates to share family-style.\n\nSalmon rolls (3 stars): Though these were raved about online, I found myself to be slightly underwhelmed. They were cooked perfectly, but I thought that the salmon was a little more fishy-tasting than I prefer.\n\nSt. Louis BBQ ribs (4 stars): This was about a half rack and came with a sweet chili BBQ sauce. There was plenty of meat to go around, you just had to eat around the bone and gristle. This dish could have definitely been a little more tender, but it was decent enough for an appetizer. I have to highlight the slaw from this dish as it was one of the tastiest I've ever had--a great level of spice, paired with the coolness of the avocado, delicious.\n\nTempura Blue lake beans (5 stars): Yum! I love tempura anything and these beans were no exception. They were quite thick, which provided a nice contrast to the tempura batter. This dish was also a good portion size, especially for the price.\n\nBlack cod (4 stars): This dish was cooked well as the fish had nice flavor. The sauce it was served with was a crowd favorite and the veggies were good as well.\n\nWasabi noodles with flat iron steak (4 stars): The noodles were tasty, as was the meat, but I found the meat to be a little tougher than I was anticipating. Nevertheless, the flavors were there and the two worked well together. \n\nSea bass (5 stars): Wow--just wow. This dish had quite a lot of praise on Yelp and rightfully so. I am a huge fan of all types of fish, but this definitely had to be one of the best fish dishes I have ever had. The portion size was good and the fish was cooked absolutely flawlessly--so flaky and flavorful, yet there was still a nice crust from the pan sear. It was great by itself, but even better in a little bit of the soy sauce they provided. Though the fish was the star, the garlic noodles were also out of this world. If I hadn't had the fish, I would have been happy with just these noodles--that's how good they are.\n\nYou might be a little perplexed by the 5 star rating, especially when adding up all of the individual items--and that should show you just how special that sea bass dish is. Yes, this place is tiny but the flavors are big. The main dishes may be a bit expensive, but they are worth the price tag. In addition, our waitress and the wait staff overall was very attentive and friendly. Definitely check this place out if you are looking to grab a bite to eat around the area, you won't be disappointed.", "author": "Ryan R."}

The restaurant itself is very small so getting a table is quite difficult. Due to the small space, prepare to be seated very close to the table next to you. \n\nService:\nThe service was great! Considering the quick turnover of the tables, I watched closely how efficient they were. The wait staff worked well together to get people seated as soon as a table opened up. We were sat down right when it was our reservation time. We were served water right away and another person came up to tell us the specials of the day. Somebody always checked up on us throughout our entire meal. That's what makes for great service!\n\nFood:\nWe ordered the scallops which were part of the daily special menu. Soooooo good! I'm glad we went this because it was cooked just perfectly! You get 3 medium sized scallops.... The micro greens that topped it and the light sauce that was drizzled over it and tobiko made this dish very flavorful!!! Loved this dish for sure!\n\nI ordered the sea bass with garlic noodles. DELICIOUS DELICIOUS DELICIOUS! The sea bass was flavorful and not overwhelming... the portion was very generous too. Now although the garlic noodles lacked the garlic aspect of it, it was YUMMY! I would order the garlic noodles by itself if it came as an entr\u00e9e. Both the fish and the noodles complemented each other well. You have the option to get rice instead of the noodles, but I would definitely recommend the noodles. This dish also comes with green beans and it was also very good. \n\nMy friend ordered the ribeye steak, touch over rare. This came with mashed potatoes and charred broccoli. It was an excellent choice and cooked accordingly. I was impressed at how perfectly cooked this was. We do wish we ordered the porkchop instead but the ribeye was amazing nonetheless.\n\nProbably our least favorite was the dessert portion of our meal. The coconut cr\u00e8me brulee with the passionfruit sauce just didn't excite us. The brulee itself was great, but we were not a fan of the passionfruit for sure. It didn't complement the brulee and was overpowering. We ended up scraping it off and made the best of it. \n\nMinus the minor things, this place is amazing overall! I can't wait to be back and try their other menu items. I'm already planning to try the salmon roll appetizer, unagi and porkchop!!!", "author": "Jasmine B."}

They come as a side with the sea bass (good) and my BF ordered them instead of mashed taters with his steak (he enjoyed his steak).  To start, we had the shrimp dumplings which were tasty and the fried salmon roll thing (which neither of us loved but seems to be highly rated on here so do you).\n\nWe finished with the creme brulee which was fantastic.\n\nSERVICE\nWe had a 9:00 p.m. reservation that my BF had made 5 or so days in advance.  No one called to confirm the reservation, but he didn't think much of it.  We showed up only to be told that there was no reservation in our name... The hostess, who was pretty gruff, didn't apologize or seem to care.  She just told us that she would put our name on the list.\n\nI thought this was pretty bad -- the very least you can do is apologize and offer us a drink or something while we wait (since it was clear she did not plan on honoring our reservation).\n\nOur waters were constantly refilled which was great but our waitress was pretty cold.

Eventually, they told us there was a minor mistake but it'll only be a few more minutes. We ended up standing and waiting for a table for *40 more minutes* (and there isn't much room to stand since the restaurant is pretty cozy).\nThere was no apology from the wait-staff or even  an acknowledgement of what just happened.

The shiitake soup was amazing, the mushroom was great too. The prime rib was a very fatty cut and I ended up cutting out most of the un-rendered fat (If I had to order it again, I'd probably get it medium instead of medium-rare, considering the meat itself wasn't absolutely stellar).

This place is tiny so definitely call ahead to get reservations since I'm not sure how long one would have to wait. As my friend and I concluded, this is one of those places that sets your expectations at the appropriate level and then exceeds those expectations -- thus, you walk away pretty happy with your experience.\n\nThe House serves Asian Fusion but not the kind where it's drenched in a disgusting amount of sauce -- but good simple Asian fusion that focuses on bringing out the flavors of the natural ingredients. Prices are decent given SF and the portion of food. Appetizers run for around $10 or so and then mains are in the $20 range. We got:\n\nHamachi appetizer special -- pretty delicious hamachi -- was particularly interesting to see how they dressed it up with a salsa to add flavor and served it on top of a marinated piece of radish that almost served as a chip. Red tobiko was a nice touch to this\n\nDiver scallops -- served with mixed greens -- black tobiko added extra kick to this perfectly seared scallop with yummy sauce too\n\nGrilled unagi -- I don't even like unagi but this was DELICIOUS. Comes on top of a avocado rice that complements it all too perfectly\n\nSea bass with garlic noodles and green beans -- very simple dish and HUGE portion. Thank god we split this because eating this by yourself could have easily been enough. Generous sea bass portion that was properly cooked, soft and flaky in the way good fish should be, and good noodles and green beans.\n\nThai iced tea panna cotta with fresh fruits -- this was seriously an amazing dessert. I didn't know one could make these simple ingredients taste oh so delicious but this was amazing.\n\nCoconut creme brulee with passionfruit puree-- pretty good creme brulee, I found the passionfruit puree to be a little tart, so wasn't a huge fan.\n\nOverall, really, really solid experience. I didn't find myself mindblown by anything, but given the price I was paying and the nature of the place, I was just happy to have pretty decent dishes across the board. \n\ntldr; would highly recommend as a less avant-garde Asian fusion place but still delicious enough and at reasonable prices!", "author": "Jasmine X."}

I love how affordable it is (for SF) and how easy it is to walk in/get a reservation (again, for SF). My most recent experience was a double date with my boyfriend and his just married cousin from China. I perused Yelp for something that's different from traditional Asian fare but still suitable to their palette. Then I remembered my previous experience here and knew The House would be modern Asian fusion done right. I called and was able to make a reservation for 4 for the night after! \n\nIt's one of those restaurants where anything you order turns out to be fantastic. A couple of my favorites entrees are the sea bass with garlic noodles, pomegranate pork chop, and steak with wasabi noodles. I didn't get to try the tuna tartar appetizer (it's on the small side) but the cousins seemed to really enjoy it! \n\nMy review is completely unneeded given the 3,000+ reviews but it's hard to not rave after eating such great food.

We had reservations at 5:30 pm, and I was late due to traffic and the scarcity of parking spaces (Don't drive here if you can avoid it!). I chose this place because I wanted to try their yelp-famous black cod, but it was not on the menu or on their specials :( I ended up ordering their sea bass, which turned out to be a well prepared equivalent with a side of green beans and garlic noodles. My boyfriend ordered the steak special which came with a side of mash potatoes and mushrooms (no greens, so I shared some of mine with him, gotta make sure he's eating something somewhat healthy haha). To end the night, we delighted in their also yelp-famous mango tapioca. \n\nThe place is fairly small and cramped. I had trouble hearing our waiter name the appetizers and specials menu along with their descriptions. There is little space between tables, so when I stood to use the restroom, I had to gingerly squeeze through the small space betweeen our table and the table next to ours, careful to not let my red dress catch on any corners and cause chaos. In addition, our conversations easily bled through to other tables and we were able to hear conversations from the tables sandwiching ours when we were eating rather than conversing. Funnily enough, an older couple on our left had also chosen to come to this establishment on their anniversary. All it all, it was a fine dining experience in a dim-lighted environment.", "author": "Fanny T."}

As we arrived, it was truly a place you can miss in the craziness of the North Beach area.  It was quite small inside, and busy.  So I am very happy our friends had made the reservations.\n\nService was very prompt and attentive after we were seated.  We had some appetizers to start including a sashimi plate with salmon, yellow tail and big eye tuna.  The dipping wasabi, soy sauce had a punch but also had great flavor.  The fish was very fresh and tasted fantastic. I believe we had a seared scallop appetizer as well that had a nice semi sweet sauce and the scallop was cooked to perfection.\n\nFor dinner, I had the wasabi noodles with flat iron steak.  The steak had a nice caramelized crust and was cooked perfect.  The noodles were also cooked perfect with a good spice.  The combination was absolutely great.  At the table was also a shortrib special, sea bass as well as lamb chops.  Everyone enjoyed their food greatly and if you can eat with your eyes, I am not surprised as everything looked fantastic.  \n\nFor dessert, I had a blueberry bread pudding a la mode.  Again, it was not to disappoint.  Great flavor in the bread pudding, not too mushy with a good texture and a fantastic topping with the ice cream\n\nI would definitely come back here but would make sure that I had reservations.", "author": "Scott P."}

The staff was very attentive and they were constantly stopping by our table to clear plates or refill our drinks. \n\n// FOOD //\nComplimentary tsukemono: Tastes similar to a pickle. The brine was great and it had that great crunch to it.\n\nCalamari: The calamari had the perfect crunch to it which made it great. The tomato sauce on the side had a kick to it. I believe they added horseradish or wasabi to it in order to give it that Asian flare.\n\nMiso black cod: Amazing! The black cod was cooked perfectly and had a delicious sauce that went well with it. Be careful of the green sauce which is pretty much a liquid wasabi sauce. They topped the black cod with a sliced sushi roll which was an interesting, but nice touch to the dish. \n\nMushroom rice with grilled prawns: This was pretty much a mushroom risotto with shrimps and bonito flakes. The risotto was absolutely delicious and the shrimps gave it a nice texture. \n\nGrilled sea bass with garlic noodles: Delicious! The sea bass was cooked to perfection. It literally melted in your mouth! The garlic noodles were also packed with flavor and had a nice chew to it. \n\nOverall, I would highly recommend The House to anyone in the SF area.

The one thing I wish would have been done, was if we had a written down description of the specials of the day.

My party ordered the fried salmon roll to start, the wasabi noodles with flank steak, the grill sea bass, and the pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce. The fried salmon roll is unlike your typical salmon rolls as this was perfectly cooked medium rare fillets of salmon inside a wonton wrapper. Think of it as a fried salmon egg roll. Out of the entrees, I enjoyed the grill sea bass best. What's not advertised is that the sea bass comes with a side of garlic noodles, which I actually preferred over the wasabi noodles. Funny because I came here for the wasabi noodles haha. But to me, the wasabi noodles tasted like regular Lo mein to me, with very little if any wasabi taste. The garlic noodles on the other hand had a distinct garlic taste which is why I liked this better. Also, the steak was a bit chewy and hard, while the sea bass was perfectly cooked. I'm not a big pork fan, but I took a bite out of the huge pork chop and it was fairly sweet in taste; the sauce reminded me of the sesame chicken. \n\nDefinitely worth a visit!", "author": "Wendy L."}

I think the flavors are pretty simple, but the highlight is that everything is very well cooked. I ordered the sea bass with garlic soy noodles and really enjoyed my meal. The fish was crispy on the outside, but so soft on the inside. I would say it ranks in top 5 of best fishes I've had. \n\n- Generous portions. There was a good amount of veggies (green beans), noodles, and fish in my dish. I was very full after finishing everything.\n\n- Good dessert. We shared a Mango Tapioca and it was tasty. \n\nCon:\n- Service was just okay. I think because it is a smaller restaurant, they try to get people in and out more quickly. Our waitress seemed a bit impatient with us since we were chatting a lot.

Nice little spot off Broadway that I have frequented a couple times previous so I'm just a tad bit overdue. \n        Waitresses greet you and if busy have a good gauge on the wait. You can call ahead for reservations, but be prompt because you may loose your spot especially on the weekends. The seating here is a bit tight so be patient and mindful of your surroundings. \n       I usually enjoy the flat iron steak but today's special was halibut. So I had the urge to change it up, and I'm so glad I did because the buttery seasoning was so delicious. Like the Asian in me I poured the sauce on top of my bowl of rice to get the most out of the meal. The halibut was cooked to perfection and with the added clams you get your shellfish craving quenched at he same time. Felt a little guilt free but unfortunately white rice was the side. I'm sure I could have substituted it for brown but I was pot committed at that point. \n       Wifey got the garlic noodles with steak, and as usual a big winner. One slight downfall was she had asked for the steak medium rare, but got it a little too pink for her liking.

It's a special appetizer, so it's only available sometimes. The spicy miso sauce has a somewhat creamy texture that is perfect for soaking the complimentary garlic bread it comes with. It's to die for. I always order more bread just to dip into it.\n\nThe salmon roll is probably the most popular appetizer here, and it's for a reason. It's cooked perfectly every time I come here, and the sauce pairs well it. \n\nMy go to dish is the kurobuta pork chop. The pork chop is cooked medium and has a sweet pomegranate sauce that's just amazing! It comes on top of some mashed potatoes that also pairs well with the sauce.\n\nI've also tried the sea bass, wasabi noodles, and miso cod which are all really good.\n\nThe service is good here also.

I hadn't heard of it before but he found it on Yelp so we met for dinner.\n\nIt's a pretty small place, packed to the gills. You'll sit close enough to your neighbors to chat with them, which is handy when you're not sure what to order. We received recommendations from the groups on either side of us as well as the waitress, and I have to say that no one steered us wrong.\n\nWe sampled three appetizers and two entrees. Great flavors abounded. The only thing that didn't really shine was the fish special that the chef prepared medium done. I took the suggestion because I like to go with the chef's vision, but I have to say that medium was just too cooked for this protein. I had one bite that was more on the medium rare side and it was BY FAR the best bite of that dish. \n\nService was really good, too.\n\nI won't have much opportunity to get back here with any frequency because I like on the Peninsula and my wife is soy-allergic, but next time I can escape to the city with a friend I'll definitely try to swing by here again.", "author": "Jason G."}

This place popped up in my search and I decided to try it. \n\nThe place itself is small. I came during a busy lunch time but since it was only a table for 2, we didn't have to wait that long. We got seated quickly. I recommend maybe planning ahead and making reservations for parties of bigger than 4. That being said, don't come here bringing a whole mob. This place isn't that big. Parking can be difficult too, but then again so is the rest of SF. \n\nWhen we were seated, our server was really nice. She was also very knowledgeable of the dishes they served there. I'm kind of picky, mostly because I have to ask if the food has meat or if it's spicy. She answered all my questions nicely. I also witness her making good recommendations to the table next to us and they loved their food. \n\nSo we needed up ordering the deep fried salmon roll with Chinese hot mustard and wasabi noodles with salmon. The salmon roll was delicious. It reminds me of a salmon eggroll. It has salad on the side which goes well with it. I tried a bit of the hot mustard which gave it extra flavor. Don't put too much if you can't handle spicy foods like me. As for the wasabi noodles, I was really surprised. You can't really taste the wasabi so I enjoyed it. The noodles are fat and chewy. The salmon was really delicious!  It was BBQed and soaked up a lot of the sauce so it was really flavorful. \n\nThis place is great for pescetarians! :) I would recommend it!", "author": "Kim C."}

Aside from the set menu, I was surprised by all of the specials they had which are waitress shared with us. I wasn't daring enough to try one of them since this was my first visit and ended up ordering from the menu:\n\n--Pickled cucumber: Complimentary and served at the beginning of the meal. Very yummy. \n\n--Deep-fried salmon roll with chinese hot mustard: Lotsa delicious salmon wrapped in seaweed and an egg roll wrapper. Four pieces are served (two long rolls cut in half). Take it easy on the hot mustard dipping sauce. It can burn your nostrils. \n\n--Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy: This dish is served with a veggie side plus rice or garlic noodles. We chose the garlic noodles (I like the thick noodles but it could have used more garlic) and the dish came with green beans (cooked perfectly). The sea bass is melt in your mouth goodness. It doesn't really need the garlic ginger soy sauce. The sea bass was the highlight of the meal for me. \n\n--Warm wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak: The wasabi noodles weren't overly wasabi-ish so they didn't give that burn but they were tasty. I didn't really care for the cucumber in the dish. The steak was cooked perfectly medium but I much preferred the sea bass. \n\n--Bittersweet chocolate truffle cake with coffee ice cream and coconut caramel: This dessert tasted like a yummy brownie. The ice cream was a bit icy but the coconut caramel had a nice deep coconut flavor. \n\nOur waitress was very sweet but I felt like the rest of the wait staff wasn't very friendly and looked almost po'd, especially the gal who greeted us when we entered the restaurant.

Hamachi and ahi each gave a plentiful helping of fish. The complimentary pickled veggies complemented both dishes. However, the sea bass was the hands down favorite of the meal. Succulent.

We narrowed it down to the ahi tuna or wasabi noodles with flat iron steak. The waiter suggested we get the wasabi noodles so that's what we went with.

However, with the limited seating, The House surely offers delightful Asian fused American entrees that comforts the palate and satisfies your stomach, undeniably.\n\nThe House hosts best with a date of 2 or a group of no more than 4!\n\nThe Sea Bass entree with Asian noodles and signature house soy sauce is my all time, classic favorite from here.\n\nLet''s just put it this way - the presentation for any dishes that you order up from here, looks and tastes delectable, such as their nicely Seared Ahi Tuna, fresh Raw Oysters and flavorful Mussels in Tomato Sauce.\n\nThe servers here seem like they have been working around the clock and scrambling around in this cozy dining space.  I'm not surprised because this place is popular.\n\nA lovely House that shelters and provides homely entrees that you just can't quite find anywhere else!", "author": "Tiffany D."}

It was a long overdue visit because I've been to North Beach so many times but The House always came as an afterthought with so many places to eat over there.  It usually wouldn't cross my mind until I eventually  would walk by it on my way out of North Beach.  So with me dining solo, getting a table was really easy that I didn't have to make reservations.\n\nBecause of yelp, it pretty much became a no-brainer for what I wanted to order:  The Salmon Rolls and the Wasabi Noodles.\n\nDeep-Fried Salmon Roll with chinese hot mustard -- http://bit.ly/1blYVdl\nI ate these with an open mind.  I do eat salmon regularly, but never prepared this manner.  They were really good!  For an appetizer, the portion size for this was pretty big.  I was almost full after finishing.  But I had to press on and move to my main course.\n\nWarm Wasabi House Noodles with angus flatiron steak -- http://bit.ly/1blZ0xJ\nThe noodles were actually sweeter than I thought they'd be and really had just a subtle taste of wasabi.  A little disappointing but still good.  What really saved this dish was the angus flatiron steak.  It was cooked perfectly and and seasoned well.\n\nThe House has lived up to the hype for me.  Creative and tasty dishes, service was on point, and a great atmosphere.  Definitely worth going back again.", "author": "Rodney H."}

Quality at a decent price (Entree's are ~$20-25)is definitely worth returning too. Came here for the first time last weekend, while looking for a restaurant that opens late. My friend and I were both quite impressed.\n\nEntree's range are average portioned, meaning they're large enough to be filling but not so much that you'll have leftovers. We left quite satisfied after 1 appetizer and 2 entree's. \n\nSince it was our first time, we looked upon our fellow yelpers for advice. Everything was delicious!\n\nIf this is your first time, I recommend getting The House's signature dishes:\n\nFried salmon roll: yes, indeed, it's a deep fried salmon sushi roll (no rice). Absolutely divine---crispy seaweed on the outside, marked by tender and slightly sashimi salmon on the inside. The appetizer comes with 4 rolls to share, fyi.\n\nWasabi house noodles with steak: it's pretty good! I was a bit skeptical, as always when restaurants try to fuse wasabi with American flavors. It's either shadowed in the dish or overwhelming. The House has somehow figured out how to incorporate the pleasant spiciness of wasabi into their soy-glazed udon noodles. Wasabi added a great taste to the dish. The steak was not necessary to accompany the noodles, but added a delightful star to the dish. It was well cooked, medium-rare done right! Even though the steak lacked a little in flavor, the wasabi noodles played well with it\n\nGrilled Sea Bass: O.M.F.G. probably one of the best sea bass's I have had. Quite possibly comparable the sea bass, I have had at a michelin restaurant. It's so freaking tender, soft enough to literally melt your mouth. You shouldn't even bite it, just let your tongue melt at it's beautiful texture. It was wonderful. It's served with sauteed green beans and either fried udon noodles (I recommend) or rice. DELICIOUS.

Parking wasn't too bad on a Monday but it does get difficult finding parking by North Beach so get there early if you can. \nService was great, we got seated right at 8pm. It's a small cozy restaurant. We started off ordering 3 different appetizers  (my bf eats alot lol). We had the ahi tuna, the octopus salad and the shrimp salad. They were all tasty and made my tummy happy.  For the main course I had the pork chop with the pomegranate sauce my boyfriend had the grilled miso seabass. The sauce for my pork chops was on point! It's sweet but it's perfect with the pork chop. Both portions were a good size and we got to try each others dishes.\nFinally, we ordered desserts! I know, we're fatasses but how can we skip dessert! All the pictures I saw on yelp made me wanna eat them! I had the coconut creme brulee and my boyfriend had the raspberry cheese cake  (the special). I told our waitress it was my boyfriend's birthday so she put a candle on his which was nice. Both desserts were so good! Creme brulee is one of my all time favorite desserts and definitely had me wanting more even tho I was full.

Only downside was slow and inattentive service but would still definitely recommend!\n\nOn Thursday, we made a reservation earlier that morning for lunch for a party of five. About half the restaurant was full, and it seemed like some tables were being held for other reservations. We were seated near the door - it was quite a cold day, so the wind got in whenever the door was open, which was quite often... \n\nAs for service, our waitress was soft spoken and when she told us the daily specials, she kept firming her head, making it extremely hard to hear her. She also forgot many of the things we asked her for: water refills, dessert menu, and extra bowls. The other server ended up helping us get those things.\n\nThe salmon roll ($11) was a delicious appetizer. The salmon was cooked perfectly and fried. The wasabi sauce also complemented it very well. It came with some spicy, preserved vegetables. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! \n\nThe shitake soup ($10), which was one of the specials,  was also great! Strong flavor, perfect for mushroom lovers!\n\nThe curry noodles with prawns ($16) was a great combination of flavors - it had a kick of spiciness and some coconut taste. \n\nThe house wasabi noodles with pork ($12) also had a kick and interesting sauce! The pork was cooked just right. We also got those noodles with salmon ($14). Once again, perfectly cooked. \n\nThe flat iron steak with a mushroom sauce ($20) came with mushrooms, mashed potatoes, greens, edamame beans, and crunchy cabbage on top. Great tasting and lovely presentation. \n\nFor dessert, the mango tapioca ($7) had just the right amount of sweetness. Would also highly recommend!\n\nThe chocolate and macademia nut tart with coffee ice cream ($8.50) was one of the special desserts. It tasted like a brownie baked in a pie crust. Probably the one dish that you can skip. It wasn't very outstanding or unique compared to the other dishes. \n\nWhile service was lacking, the food was so great and unique for very reasonable prices.", "author": "Grace C."}

It was not the case at all with House.\n\nStuff to try:\n* Tuna tartare - good consistency and texture, nice deviation of the usual tartares.\n* Sea bass - very nicely cooked, not too tender or tough. has a nice natural sweetness that really makes the bass shine.\n* Pork chop - nicely cooked, not dry or tough at all. sauce and flavoring is fusion style and very delicious.\n* Fried salmon roll - somehow these are deep fried and yet the salmon is still nice and juicy and raw on the inside. Definitely worth a try.\n\nTheir wine menu is also very reasonably priced and have some of the best wines locally from Napa. Had a great grenache to go with the sweet pork chop for $8. Very reasonable.\n\nDinner for two came out to be around $100 with appetizer and wine, tax and tip included. For SF prices, it's really worth the money.\n\nThe restaurant is very small and intimate.

The environment is very loud and tables are very close to each other.\n\nHere's what I tried:\n-Deep Fried Salmon Roll - I love how the rolls came out. Perfectly deep fried with a crispy outside and the salmon was soft and still a little raw in the center. This came with some type of hot mustard sauce. I'm usually not a big fan of hot mustard, but it went perfectly with the roll. Just don't douse roll in the sauce.\n\n-Black cod special with California roll - This was one of their specials that's not listed on their menu. The first bite I took, I feel like I was dreaming. The cod just melted in my mouth and was full of flavor. My favorite dish of the night.\n\n-Sea Bass with soy ginger - I love eating sea bass and the sauce that came with it was delicious! It also came with string beans and a choice from mash potatoes, noodles, or rice. I picked the mash.\n\n-Wasabi noodles with flat iron steak - I really liked the noodles in this dish. I ordered the steak medium rare and it came out a little more on the rare side. No big deal for me though. The steak however was very difficult to cut and a little chewy. The more cooked pieces at the ends were a little easier to eat. The noodles definitely saved this dish.\n\nOverall, everything was was very good.

The dipping sauce had a nice kick and the little side salad provided some respite from the deep fried goodness. \n\nThe octopus salad had amazing flavor, although light on the octopus. They should call it a salad topped with baby octopus instead of octopus salad to adjust expectations. The crispy pork rinds gave it nice flavor and crisp.

All those people that rave about the dish are absolutely spot-on!!\n\nThe hubby mentioned that he's generally not a fan of pork chops, but he loved his dish, probably the best pork chops ever! The sauce is pretty sweet, though not cloyingly so, and compliments the natural sweetness of the swine. The whole kernels of pomegranate provided a bit of crunch and is visually appealing. The sides were simple -- mashed potatoes and blanched asparagus, which allowed the pork and sauce to sing.\n\nAltogether, this is one of the better meals in SF. The prices are reasonable and the service was hands off. The food comes out very quickly, even though the place was busy. The service is nothing to sing about, but the food more than makes up for it. Can't wait to come back again :).", "author": "Alice W."}

Brings Asian fusion to a completely new level. The small restaurant has quite a lovely atmosphere and from my experience has great service. Went on a whim and was unable to make a reservation, but just walked in on a Sunday evening (8/30) at 7pm with three other friends, put our name down, walked over to 15 Romolo for a quick drink, and a table was ready for us upon returning! Although it is Burning Man week so I wouldn't recommend always counting on the same experience.\n\nWe started with the deep fried salmon roll, which was pretty standard as far as the roll goes, but what really made the appetizer was its Chinese hot mustard that had the perfect wasabi ratio. Asked to keep the remainder of it even after finishing the roll \n\nFor our entrees we got the flat iron steak with wasabi noodles, which I ordered on my last visit and got it again simply because I was craving it. Those noodles are to die for. The best part of this dish is that the portion size is huge, especially considering that it is the cheapest entree on the menu. I was more than satisfied afterward. \n\nMy favorite of the night was the Kurobuta Porkchop my friend ordered. It was tender, cooked perfectly, and served with this delicious pomegranate currant sauce. Although I do hope that management reads this and takes this into consideration: the mashed potatoes it was served with was ATROCIOUS!! I would go as far to say that KFC mashed potatoes are better, which is a tad embarrassing for a restaurant of your echelon.\n\nOther noteworthy dishes: The creme brulee with a passionfruit puree is mind-blowing. The sea bass we've ordered in the past has also been another favorite.", "author": "Andrea D."}

I had a reservation here to meet with some friends for dinner. We arrived at our reservation time and we proceeded inside. The place is cozy to say the least. Very small and at one point we could have been elbow to elbow with the table next to us. We were a party of 5 so the seating arrangement in the back was a little awkward so one person in our party had their back on the table next to us.\n\nThe service was good. As each course came out we were given explanations as to what we ordered which was nice to hear. We started with oysters and they were fresh, salty and fishy. Just the way I like them. The vinegar sauce that was paired with it was a little spicy. Other than that, just your regular oysters. We also got the salmon roll. The salmon inside was a little dry and bland. The sauce that paired with it was a mustard sauce of some sort which was okay.\n\nFor entrees I got the fish and my girlfriend got the beef with wasabi noodles. The fish was moist and tender and paired well with the green beans and noodles (no wasabi). Even though the skin had a little char on it it didn't take away from the flavor which was nice. If anything it enhanced it for me. For my girlfriend's dish the beef was cooked to a perfect medium rare and for the noodles, I appreciated the wasabi taste but at times it was too overbearing. \n\nWe finished our night with one of each dessert from the menu to split. We had the creme brulee which was pleasant. The custard was made well and the sugar on top was not burnt. Well done. We also had a thai tea pana cotta which was to die for. I love the flavor profile of thai tea and this dessert had it. I can't recall the other one we had but it was okay from what i remember.\n\nAll in all the service was good, the food had good flavors but there were just a few execution flaws which prompts a 4 star rating. Good place to try once.", "author": "Jeromy G."}

The hostess said the wait usually is a minimum of 30 minutes during peak hours.  However, when we (a party of four) got there around 5:30 PM on a Friday, we were seated immediately.  I'm guessing it was because we were there pretty early and it was Memorial Day weekend.\n\nWe started off the deep-fried salmon roll and soft shell crab as the appetizers, which were delicious and full of flavor.  The roll was served with hot mustard sauce while the crab was served with a side of cold noodle dipped in a semi-sweet sauce.\n\nFor the main course, I ordered the Miso Black Cod special while my boyfriend ordered the Angust Ribeye Steak.  The special was served with these uniquely shaped California sushi rolls, which were made with real crab meat, on top and laid on a bed of green vegetables.  The sushi was freshly made and the cod was AMAZING...practically melted in your mouth!  It filled me up just right so I had enough room for dessert hehe :)  I tried some of my boyfriend's ribeye steak, which DELICIOUS.  It was very juicy and had the same melt in your mouth texture as the cod.\n\nWe ordered the dessert special, which was a pecan chocolate pie topped with chocolate/peanut butter ice cream and drizzled with salted caramel sauce.

For appetizers we got the fried salmon rolls and the ahi tuna tartare. Both were yummy and I found myself enjoying the wasabi sauce for the salmon rolls more than the amount of wasabi placed in the ahi tuna tartare. It can be a bit strong for the unwary but I enjoyed the myriad of flavors nonetheless. For entrees we ordered the Sea bass which comes with garlic noodles and some string beans along with the special of that night which was a Korean bbq dish served with rice, kimchi, greens, and topped with some type of fried root. Both. Were. Amazing. For the Sea bass I can see why this is a staple. The fish had a comforting melt-in-your-mouth flavor and left me coming back for more. The Korean bbq gave me flashbacks of my wonderful time in South Korea and I loved the kimchi though just as a heads up it has a sweeter taste than other kimchi which I still appreciated. To round us off we ordered the mango tapioca for dessert and all I have to say is get it! You will not be disappointed.

There are some things that you don't really need to improve upon because they're already great in their own rights. I have to give it to the House though. Even if they don't do an authentic ethnic cuisine, their execution of their dishes is excellent. From the perfectly seared crust of rare ahi tuna to the flaky interior of a pan-fried cod, food here is cooked impeccably, and sauces are rich and lavish. Service is wonderful and expedient, and you'll leave feeling full and happy. Recommendations definitely include the tuna and cod (if it's available as a seasonal special).

Had made a reservation a week prior so didn't have much of a trouble with getting in at desired date and time. Parking was a toughie in this neck of the woods. But hey, isn't 7x7 parking like this anyways? Use public transit or Uber/Lyft is highly recommended. I was able to find a spot by the Vallejo Steps so definitely check that out if you're into scenic views of the bridge and some glutes-tightening to impress your date. Nonchalantly flexing while going to and from your vehicle can either be an appetizer or dessert. All based on perspective, my friend. \n\nUpon arriving, there were already groups of people around the entrance hoping to get a table. The place is very small. I appreciate the dim lightning for romantic/fine dining ambiance, but it was quite loud from the close proximity of dining neighbors and the restaurant itself. I would deem this as a not so intimate 21 questions-type restaurant to get to know your date because it's hard to hear and to keep up with conversation without the repeated banter of \"what did you say?\". Tables are seated very close...almost communal seating. We didn't mind too much because we were there for their much anticipated uniquely presented great food. Generally we tend to dine for a long time (3 hours) time frame, but given that it was a semi-rushed setting (from groups of people waiting outside like there's a drought-oh wait, there is!) we were there for 2 hr instead. I did noticed other patrons dined for roughly 1-1.5h (a fairly normal turnover rate).  \n\nWe ordered:\n\nAppetizer: \n-grilled unagi avocado sushi rice, shaved bonito $13\n\nMains: \n-warm wasabi house noodles, angus flatiron steak $21\n -grilled sea bass, garlic ginger soy $28\n -kurobuta pork chop, pomegranate currant sauce $27\n\nDesserts: \n-their special strawberry rhubarb pie with vanilla ice cream\n\nDrinks: Prosecco & pinot noir\n\nApparently this was a lot of food for normal people because we happened to order as much food as the family of 4 next to us and the dad said to us \"you two sure don't look that big!!\" because he was too astounded as to how we were able to finish all our food. This would be the mystery of the universe we have yet to understand. The food was phenomenal. Although I wish my steak didn't come out medium to rare, I think our server may have misheard medium-well done. We didn't want to send it back because we were just so wowed with the taste and presentation that we had already ate majority of the steak. I just love looking at food art and this place does not disappoint. The balance of food pairings were there. Thank you asian fusion. Although I didn't make it public we're celebrating a birthday, it would've been a nice touch if we were asked if we're celebrating anything in particular. General rule of thumb, time is money so our server was tipped fat. Our server did not rushed us which I appreciated, but it is a tiny place and it's courteous of us to not hog our table too long. Let's not forget that we are here for the food and it was great! I hope to eat my way through their menu next time around.", "author": "Diana W."}

To be honest, I didn't care for the Yelp favorites like the deep fried salmon roll and the grilled sea bass was decent. What I loved the most though was the daily special -- I believe it was mahi mahi with a white miso butter sauce. The fish melted into a pool of deliciousness. Yes it was Asian, but it had a richness to it that couldn't be achieved with Asian ingredients and a finesse that reminded me of French cuisine. Tip here - order the special! We also had the chicken entree which was as good of a chicken dish you could get at what seemed like a seafood house (don't worry, your non-fish-eating friends won't mind at all). \n\nIn whole, I had a great time.

I was afraid that the \"Asian Fusion\" restaurant would be pretentious and overpriced. I was happy to discover that The House did not have those characteristics at all. It's just delicious.\n\nThe four of us ordered salmon rolls and crab cake for starters. The salmon rolls were crunchy and tasty; however, the mustard sauce was so strong that I almost cried. The crab cake was also good but it was probably the weakest item that we ordered.\n\nTwo people ordered the seabass and my other dining companion ordered the wasabi noodles. I ordered the miso cod that was on the specials menu. The fish was cooked to perfection and it had the perfect buttery texture. I was very satisfied!\n\nThe total damage (including tax and tip) for 2 appetizers, 4 mains, and 1 alcoholic beverage was $180, certainly not cheap but very fair for the quality and quantity we got.", "author": "Yi Z."}

We got to North Beach around 5:45 circles to find parking, I had a feeling this area would be very difficult and on a Saturday evening but by the grace of God, we found a diagonal parking space on Vallejo that wasn't metered and had no time restriction just as someone was backing out! We were really early so we walked around and came back around 7:10 and we were seated at the first table right by the window around 7:40. Immediately our servers brought us water and hot waters on request we looked at the menu and then our server told us about the daily special for appetizers and entrees. My friend and I both feel like having fish so we both ordered from the daily specials, she ordered the grilled halibut topped with julienned yams on top of garlic mashed potatoes and cauliflower with shimeji mushrooms and some spinach and I decided to go with the miso glazed cod topped with avocado crab rolls on top of a bed of gailan (Chinese broccoli). First, to start we had cucumber slices pickled in rice vinegar and sugar and topped with sesame seed. We waited about 15 minutes before our entree came out and their were so many people waiting for their reservation time and this is a pretty small hole-in-the-wall restaurant mind you. My friend and I wanted to share our dishes so I started off with the cod. I started cutting into the buttery cod  and dipping it in the miso glaze that covered the plate, it was DELICIOUS, so much umami and the fish just melted in your mouth while the skin has a perfect crisp. The cod was very reminiscent of the traditional Japanese gindara saikoyaki. I then cut into one of the odd shaped crab avocado rolls on top and it was a nice contrast from the warmth, buttery and sweetness of the cod to the cool crab and avocado filled roll with sushi rice and nori. The Chinese broccoli stems on the bottom was perfectly cooked as well, I'm guessing it was most likely blanched. So I had half my cod and my friend had half her halibut so we switched. Halibut is one of my favorite fish, I love the firm texture and mild taste. In this case the halibut was grilled to perfection, with the perfect amount of seasoning. It's served on top of some very creamy  and heavy on the roasted garlic mashed potatoes and cauliflower with shimeji mushrooms through and some spinach. We ended up finishing both our dishes and my friend was raving about their creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e earlier so we had to give it a try since we were already there. The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e came out in about 2 minutes, so that means that the top was torched earlier but it was still nice and crispy. So what's unique about their creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e is that it's a passion fruit creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, a typical creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e with passion fruit pur\u00e9e on top which is slightly tangy and acidic which contrasts the richness and sweetness of the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e itself. When you crack the caramelized top, the passion fruit just drops down into the the smooth, sweet and rich cream. I'm glad I was able to try The House tonight, I highly recommend this restaurant to others for Asian Fusion because they have their standards set quite high.", "author": "Christopher W."}

After that, I knew I had to come back again soon.\n\n And soon enough, after 4 years, I am back! \n\nThe menu offered a good variety of food and with very decent pricing! We all decided to share appetizers. We got the Maine Crab Cakes, Steamed Mussels, and their daily special, Seared Scallops. Oh my, those scallops. They were moist and perfectly cooked! We shared 3 scallops amongst the 6 of us, and we were very tempted to make another order of the scallops. It's a must get if they have it! The crab cake was fluffy and was beautifully deep fried, Well for the mussels, definitely the weaker of the appetizers, and I would probably not order again. \n\nFunny, my friend and I shared and we actually ordered the same thing I got last time I came, I guess my taste hasn't changed in the past few years. We got the Special Miso Cod with California Rolls. The cod melts in your mouth more than cotton candy melts in your mouth. Yes, it was that soft and amazing. The whole dish was great! The California rolls also mended very well with the fish. \n\nMy other friends got the Kurobuta Pork Chop with Pomegranate Sauce, Wasabi House Noodles with Flat Iron Steak, Mushroom Risotto with Shrimp, and their daily special of some kind of steak. Overall, the pork chop was my least favorite. It was tough and the sauce was overly tangy for my taste. Everything else was delicious though! \n\nOverall, I'm already looking forward to my third visit. The specials are more pricey than the items listed on the menu, so ask for the price!  (The scallops was at a alarming expensive price for three small pieces! But, no regrets!)\n\nP.S. Ask for their daily specials! It's not on the menu but rest assured, it will be delicious. \n\nYou can find free street parking after 6PM a few streets up and to your right.\n\nAlso, make a reservations a few days ahead! They will probably have room the day of, but at unconventional times.", "author": "Winnie I."}

We arrived for our 6:00pm reservations and it is highly recommended that you get reservations as the restaurant is not very large. \n\nAfter hearing the specials from our waitress, we checked out the menu and came to a consensus on some starters to share and our entrees. Our orders:\n\nStarters:\nSalad with walnuts and apples.  Nice lightly dressed salad with candies walnuts.

It does have some pretty incredible reviews (and reviewers). We made a reservation, unfortunately they could only accommodate us at 9pm. Since I'm usually in bed at that time, we decided to arrive at 8pm to see if we could get in early. Lucky for us they were able to get us a table right away! The place is tiny, like 10 tables tiny. The decor is clean and the staff is attentive.\n\nI was instructed to get the angus ribeye steak, my friend settled on the pork chop, and a colleague got the swordfish special. They started the table with some homemade pickles, they were delicious and I couldn't keep my fork away. If they sold them I would have bought a mason jar full. Our food arrived shortly after we ordered. My steak was huge and covered in garlic. It was cooked to perfection but I would have liked a bit more salt. It laid on a bed of mashed potatoes which were a little dry and some Chinese broccoli, which was cooked well and delicious. I was able to steal a piece of my friend's pork chop and it was perfection. The pomegranate currant sauce was the perfect accompaniment to the pork chop, I was a little hesitant when I saw it on the menu, but it worked so well. \n\nOf course we had to get dessert and they have a dessert for all tastes. I was immediately drawn to the coconut creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and it didn't disappoint. The coconut flavor in the custard was subtle but present. I wasn't a hug fan of the passionfruit sauce on top, it was a bit tart too for my tastes. My friend went with the apple crumb pie ala mode, which I found to be pretty standard, nothing special. My colleague went with the bittersweet chocolate truffle cake, which wasn't for me. It was dense like a flour-less cake and too dark for my tastes.\n\nOverall, the meal was solid and I would definitely come back, especially for the pork chop. The meal had a few misses for me but I can see why people love it so much. I love that it's good hearty American food with a subtle Asian twist.", "author": "Jessica P."}

Nice ambience ...great  for dates !   \n\nThe service at this restaurant could be a bit better . They seemed tired or grumpy; this was around 8pm. However our waiter was super friendly and informing . \n\nWe skipped appetizers because we wanted to get 3.5 main entrees ! \n\nWe ordered... \n\nKobe beef ribeye with reduced truffle sauce. We asked it to be cooked medium rare! It came out perfect and delicious ! The dish also came with mashed potatoes. Can't go wrong with potatoes. The truffle sauce was light but very tasty ! I wished It had more truffle sauce though. Overall the dish was good but nothing outstanding compared to other restaurants  that serve similar dishes to this. 5/5\n\nWasabi noodles. Omg delicious. So good that I would just come back for this !!!!!!!!!! Omg I would give this dish ... 10/5. The taste and texture  is sooooo good. Lol idk how else to describe it . The orange veggy thing made the bite more crunchy too . We asked for mild wasabi though, so in the end I didn't really taste the wasabi at all. But this dish was different than the garlic noodles . \n\nGrilled seabass w/ garlic noodles . Omg this dish is heaven. The fish was so moist and juicy. It was coolly perfectly and just like the wasabi noodles, the garlic noodles were just as good. The taste and texture of the garlic noodles were perfect. This dish is worth to come back for again n again and def. better than the Kobe beef ribeye with reduced truffle sauce. This dish also came with a sauce . The fish was so good that you don't even need the sauce ! \n\nLast but not least but my ultimate favorite dish out of the other main entrees ... The miso black cod topped with CA rolls. Omfg ... I would def. come back for this too. The fish was on POINT. The seabass already blew my mind away ( like how can a fish be perfectly cooked.. * soooo juicyyyyy ) ... But the black cod even blew my mind away even more !!! The fish was super juicy and moist ! More moist than the seabass . The natural juice of the fish had more flavoring too ! The sauce in this dish ( the green and brown sauce surrounding the fish ) was very tasty !!!!! I kept dipping the fish in the sauce .  honestly though, the fish was so good that you don't even need to dip it in the sauce ! The ca rolls were  a typical ca roll but I think it had cream cheese in it . CA rolls were very good and simple . \n\nIn general, the fishes here .. AMaZING! So if you are a fish person.. You def. need to try their fish dishes !!!!!!!!! If I'm craving fish, I am def. coming here . \n \nFor dessert we ordered the coconut creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, passion fruit puree and Keemun Mao  tea. The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was very good! The passion fruit  gave it the tangy taste . The tea was good too but it tasted like every other asian tea ! ( then again I'm not a tea expert) \n\nThis place is worth 5 stars.  On yelp it has 4.5 stars, with 3000+ reviews . It definitely holds up to it's ratings !", "author": "Alicia N."}

We ended up parking at Portsmouth Garage and walked the couple of blocks. \n\nWe decided to try the \n\nDeep Fried Salmon Roll-spicy mustard sauce had a good balance of heat and savoriness however the roll itself was bland and felt the salmon was overpowered by the fried shell \n\nCrab Cake-while appealing to look at, the crab flavor was muddled by the mayo sauce but the crust was done well  \n\nSpecial Appetizer: Fried Softshell Crab-breading was crunchy but bland and could taste the oil, presented quite well, the bed of spicy cold noodles helped to add flavor but overly aggressive \n\nMain Entrees\n\nSalmon over Wasabi Noodles-flavors were decent but felt it lacked depth, didn't find myself wanting to go back for more, noodles were too oily but had a good mild kick\n\nGrilled Seabass w/ Garlic Noodles-amazing portion, fresh quality, center had a good opaque color, seared nicely, thoroughly enjoyed this dish the most. \n\nChicken over Mashed Potatoes and Saut\u00e9ed Mushrooms in Truffle Oil-chicken was moist but one note, no highs, no lows\n \nTeriyaki Glazed Steak over mashed potatoes topped with ginger and scallions-massive piece of steak, topped with a beautiful hue of green and yellow (scallions and ginger) cooked well, balanced with sweetness and saltiness and relatively fork tender.\n\nDessert consisted of Coconut Cr\u00e8me Brulee topped with passion fruit puree and a chocolate torte with a scoop of ice cream. The cr\u00e8me brulee had a great crisp burnt sugar layer that broke well however didn't care for the actual coconut flavor or the minimal amount of passion fruit puree. Felt the puree on top lacked finesse in presentation considering how much effort they put in some of their other dishes. \n\nChocolate cake was fudgy and had a good amount of sweetness. I say dessert aren't their strengths but a good effort.\n\nService was ok, definitely nothing to rave about \n\nOverall Thoughts\n\nWhile I can see the mass appeal of The House, what with its generous portions value friendly prices, and familiar flavor profiles, it was too straight forward for my taste", "author": "Eddie W."}

We decided on Asian cuisine.  Down the road from our hotel, I was directed to a place that was rated 4 1/2 stars overall with over 2500 reviews!!!!!  Man, we REALLY needed to check this place out.\n\nThe best thing to do is to make reservations.  They do take walk ins, however, it's not a guarantee that you'll be seated right away.  The place is SMALL!  When I arrived there, my first comment was, \"wow, it looks like a small store front property!\"  It literally looks like it.  In the restaurant, there's no more than 20 tables.  Luckily, we were able to get seated right away but had to promise the servers that we will out of our seats in an hour.  This made us more curious to try their food as it seemed soooo popular.\n\nWe started off with the Scallops that were on special for the evening for about $12.  Three grilled scallops, accompanied with green sprouts and ponzu sauce, garnished with radish slices and caviar.  The scallops were sooo fresh, grilled and seasoned to perfection!  WOW!  I would get that again in a heartbeat.  For my main course, I got the Angus Ribeye Steak for $26.  Grilled Ribeye on a bed of mashed potatoes with housemade teriyaki sauce, garlic butter and sauteed garlic chunks.  OH-EMM-GEEE!!!  I was in heaven.  This steak was so tender, perfectly grilled.  The huge chunks of garlic really enhanced the flavor of the meat and the mashed potatoes were creamy.  This dish is a meat-lover's dream.  Trust me, you NEED this dish in your life :)\n\nFor dessert, we got the mango tapioca and the apple crumble ala mode for about $10 each.  What a great way to end this amazing meal.  The mango was manipulated in the tapioca to look like a flower!  The crumble was crunchy and delightful.  \n\nIf you're in San Francisco, there's no doubt that you should check this joint out.

Tables are close together and it gets a bit chaotic, but I found the environment buzzing & charming. \n\nService was great and I started with the salmon rolls. These things are deep fried and not at all what I was expecting. I've been trying to make myself try things I don't usually like (such as salmon) but I absolutely loved this appetizer. The wasabi dipping sauce packs a serious punch and the flavors just exploded. For my entree I had the steak on top of wasabi noodles (this girl loves her wasabi, what can I say?) It was one of the best steaks I've ever had and was perfectly cooked. The wasabi noodles were as amazing as I had hoped.\n\nI left completely full, buzzed on wine, and a total fan of The House.

We called a few days before our trip out to the city and was told there were no reservations available for the day we wanted to come in. We still made plans to come here nonetheless and waited a few minutes around the door prior to opening. Luckily they were willing to seat us considering we were the first patrons to arrive upon opening, however we were told we had to be out of the restaurant within 45 minutes. Of course, for not being on the reservation list we were seated in the very back corner right next to the smelly restrooms. Just wonderful.\n\nWe ordered a few dishes that were said to be popular on yelp. For appetizers, we tried their sashimi, scallops and kobe beef. The sashimi here is nothing compared to what a a real japanese sushi restaurant serves. It wasn't fresh as I expected it to be. The scallops were fairly good. I think it was my favorite dish of all. It was very flavorful and tender. What's dissatisfying about the appetizers we had is that they were not made to order. The minute we placed our order, our 3 appetizers were brought back out to us within the next 2 minutes. Who knows how long these dishes have been sitting out for?! \n\nFor my entree I ordered a sea bass with garlic noodles. Sea bass was nothing spectacular; not a dish I would recommend to others.

The grilled octopus was a little tough, but had awesome flavor. The crab was the most creative of the starters, and came with a vinegar and Sriracha sauce that worked well.\n\nThe mains were great for lunch. Soups and salads were light, yet filled up everyone. I got the seared tuna and it was awesome. The tuna was rare on the inside and simply seasoned on the outside - a standard, but great job. On the tuna was a small salad with tiny seaweed pieces.

My sea bass, one of their signature dishes, was good but really didn't live up to the hype. It was a big chunk of sea bass though. The steak and pork were alright too. The garlic and wasabi noodles were a little underwhelming -- if that's the only ingredient you should make it REALLY taste like wasabi/garlic, no? I ain't scurred.\n\nThe waitresses were really nice but the hostess or boss lady who was standing there looking kinda mean and disheveled really confused me and put me off.\n\nI love the little house punch out on the placemat.", "author": "Vivian H."}

Seasoned perfectly and the sauce pairs very well with it. \n\nI also got the wasabi noodles + steak as recommended by Yelp. It was very good; had a very nice wasabi kick to it. The steak was also cooked to my liking, although didn't have much blood in rare form.

You can add/sub out different proteins if you're a bit more picky.

It's a small place, so make a reservation. While the ambiance and food presentation is definitely a bit more \"upscale\", the food itself is pretty affordable. Great date night spot. \n\nOf the few appetizers I've tried, my fave is the SALMON ROLLS. I make sure to order this every time! The rolls are filled with generous portions of salmon and wrapped in a wonton-like wrapper. They're served with the most AMAZING sweet, wasabi sauce. The sauce is so good that my bf & I asked for it in a to-go container ;) \n\nMy favorite dish is the MISO COD, served with Asian veggies and avocado rolls. The cod is unbelievably smooth and flavorful. 10/10 would order again. I also recommend the warm wasabi noodles, which are chewy with a very, very, very subtle wasabi flavor.

Couldn't help but ate another piece \n\nI ordered the house wasabi noodles with flatiron steak.  If you have a sensitive palate, don't get this but for someone who kind of likes wasabi, this dish isn't bad! You can taste hints of wasabi but it's not bad when you have the shredded cucumbers and teriyaki sauce all mixed it. The noodles are chewy and soft but not mushy.  I got my steak medium rare which they did very well.  I sorta of wish they season the steak just a bit more but it would have been a overwhelming heavy dish in all.\n\nOther dishes I have tried - seabass, black cod, ahi tuna and the glazed salmon.  I'm not a big seafood fan, esp fish...but I have to admit that I kind of wish I ordered the seabass or ahi tuna!  The ahi tuna with the spicy aioli, a perfect pair for someone who doesn't like the fishyness and the aioli is so creamy and good!! The seabass literally fell apart in my mouth and had a bit of a fluff I guess I can say, lightly seasoned but not letting its fishness come out.

Was very excited to eat here after all how can a place with over 3200 reviews and four and a half stars be anything less than excellent? \n\nUpon arrival to this place, first of all they got our reservation time wrong we had called the night previously and reserved a table for two for 8:30 PM but they had us down for 930. This was a big hassle as we had to go walk around for a whole hour and almost didn't come back. But once we finally came back at 930 we still have to wait before two other parties were seated before us; maybe they had a reservation ahead of us I don't know. We were finally seated and greeted immediately our waiter was nice and respectful and everything came out pretty quickly. \n\nThe biggest problems I had with this place were first of all the hostess. I don't know if she was also the manager or the owner of this place but she had a very cold attitude and was very withdrawn. Didn't at all give us a feeling of warmth and welcome. Secondly the place is very small and cramped we were seated right by the entrance and the people waiting to be seated were literally hovering over us and to our rights was the next table and the people next to us or less than a feet away. Next, which is a huge pet peeve of mine, was that my Diet Coke was brought out in a can. For supposedly nice restaurants such as this bringing out a soda and I can is very cheap. I like to drink 2-3 glasses of soda every time I have dinner and these places limits me and of course do not offer a free refill. Next, they messed up our bill we ordered an entr\u00e9e but quickly changed it to another however on the final bill they had left initial entr\u00e9e that was more expensive. Next I ordered coffee with out dessert and it's never came out finally when I reminded about the coffee it was later brought out pretty cold and they added it to the bill. Any decent place would not have charged for a small cup of cold coffee after forgetting to bring it out. \n\nWhat I did appreciate about this place was their food. Our appetizer which was the salmon roll and my main entr\u00e9e which was the Kobe steak were great. I have had better before but have nothing negative to say about my meal here. So for the food alone I would give this place four stars but for everything else mentioned above I would give this place fairly two stars for a total of a very weak three stars.\n\nI don't know maybe my experience was just unlucky since everyone else seems to love this place but I would definitely not come back.", "author": "Farbod F."}

Look for its (relatively) modest neon sign on the corner of Grant & Columbus avenues -- and the aroma of fresh wasabi emanating down the block.\n\nThe interior is also quite spare -- and small.  Reservations here are a must.  My party of 4 would've been waiting for hours on a Tuesday night if we hadn't made reservations.  Luckily, with reservations on the books, we were seated immediately.\n\nAfter ordering a round of wine (a delicious Sauvignon blanc for me, natch) and snacking on the complementary pickled cucumbers with sesame seeds, I decided to start with the deep-fried salmon rolls.  These were excellent.  The salmon was fresh and delectable on the inside, while crispy on the outside.  My favorite part was the wasabi dipping sauce, which provided just the right amount of kick.\n\nFor the entree, I had the wasabi noodles with flank steak.  I could eat tubs and tubs of these noodles.  They were just that orgasmic.  The depth of flavor in the noodles was out of this world, and the flank steak was cooked to a perfect medium.  (And YES -- this may be the only restaurant in California that actually knows NOT to overcook the beef.  It's a miracle!)\n\nThe desserts at The House are outstanding as well.  I had the mango tapioca, which was smooth, silky, sweet (but not too sweet), and beautiful to look at as well.\n\nIn fact -- *everything* served at The House is beautiful.

Just one persons opinion. \n\nOn to the food. \n\nWe started with three \"small\" plates; butter lettuce salad, crab cake and scallops. All really solid. The salad was perfectly well dressed (my husband would have been in heaven), the crab cake was in a shape none of us have seen before - de-lish!! And the scallops (they added a 4th to the plate for our party of 4 - for a fee of course) melted in our mouths. \n\nWe shared our mains - noodles with flatiron steak  - very flavorful and the steak perfectly cooked\n\nTuna was seared to perfection - we all agreed a fav of the table. \n\nPork was really beautifully paired with the pomegranate sauce.

My boyfriend and I agreed that this place is like a 3.5. It may be because we expected it to be SOOO good due to high volume of reviews and ratings. We definitely came on an empty- if not starving- stomach so we're taking that into consideration.\n\nWe got the deep fried salmon roll, Wasabi noodles, and the pomegranate pork chop. The salmon roll was okay, for some reason it felt like it was too dry. The sauce it came with was something mixed with Wasabi and it was giving the after taste a weird sensation. I wouldn't recommend breathing through your nose after having your tongue touch the sauce. However, we liked it because the moment you taste the sauce you can taste the spiciness but after you're done chewing you're not left with a spicy tongue. Amazing.\n\nI also would not recommend the Wasabi noodles as an entree for yourself. It's good to get if it's going to be shared. The flavor/ sauce was too strong. I found myself constantly looking for some noodles that were untouched by the sauce or I had to eat something else immediately after eating some noodles. I was not able to consistently eat the noodles normally. Thankfully my boyfriend and I shared everything so I got a good balance to the taste. \n\nThe pork chop was definitely better than the other two dishes.

Although a simple dish, it was super flavorful with a kick that complemented the pickled flavor. \n\nSome of the appetizers we ordered included the chicken kale salad, tuna tartare, unagi, fried salmon rolls, and the mussels. We thoroughly enjoyed every appetizer! The chicken kale salad was a simple dish but the chicken was very moist and the kale was nice and crispy and not bitter at all. The salad was dressed appropriately with the dressing and was not overwhelming. The tuna tartare comes in a tower that are stacked in between tortilla chips. The flavors were absolutely wonderful. The tuna was nice, moist, and seasoned appropriately. The salmon roll was also very delicious. The salmon was not overcooked and you can see still the rawness in the middle, which definitely was a good thing! It was so tender and flavorful, I could eat another plate! Hands down my favorite was the mussels. The mussels were nice and plump and the sauce was amazing. We even asked for a side of bread to finish off the sauce because it was just so flavorful. \n\nFor the entrees, we ordered the BBQ pork ribs, the porkchop, sea bass, and the angus ribeye steak. They are known for their wasabi noodles which comes with some of the entrees. It is delicious! The wasabi is not overpowering and has a kick to it that complements the meat. Some of my favorites would have to include the sea bass and the porkchop. The sea bass literally melts in your mouth from how moist it was. Super flavorful and the sauce just takes it to another level. As for the pork chop, the pomegranate currant sauce is such a great pairing with the flavors of pork chop. It helped enhance the flavors and definitely provided a sweet/tart component that goes well very.\n\nOverall, we were very pleased with the service and quality of the food.

Some dummies come in or leave without shutting the door so that's one annoying thing, and probably the only one.\n\nThe server was a bit slow, but we had these deep fried tempura asparagus spears and fresh calamari for appetizers. They nailed it on both of them. Before that they also had a pickled item for a table appetizer.

At the bottom were these green vegetables I had never tried before, with the seared tuna, and two avocado sushi rolls on top. Check the photo I uploaded.\n\nMy friend ordered the cod. This is what I will order next time! It literally melted in my mouth like butter when I tried it.\n\nI didn't think we'd get dessert but we did. We got some sort of berry pie that was great. I'm sure this place is considered expensive, but it's well worth trying it. We also got some of their fresh made almond cookies to take home. This is a hidden gem in North Beach amongst a plethora of Italian restaurants. This Asian fusion restaurant stands alone.", "author": "Marty J."}

I always hear about how great the food in SF is compared to LA, but I've yet to find a restaurant that blows my mind. Perhaps I'm coincidentally eating at places that just don't mesh well with my taste. Exhibit A would be The House.\n\nAfter a failed attempt to eat at State Bird Provisions on Labor Day, we came here shortly after opening time without reservations. I'm not a huge fan of Asian Fusion but with The House having over 3,000 reviews averaging 4.5 stars, I figured the chances of me disliking the food were slim. And I was right -- I didn't dislike the food, but it was pretty mediocre.\n\nA server sat us after informing us we'd only have 90 minutes to eat, before we had to give up the table for a party with reservations. For my main, I ordered the Wasabi Udon with Flat Iron Steak. The dish was flavorful and cooked well, but didn't particularly stand out. For dessert, we got the Mango Tapioca and and Coconut Creme Brulee. Both were good, but nothing mind-blowing.\n\nThe restaurant was filled to it's max capacity, so it's obvious this place is popular and reservations are recommended. Unfortunately, I probably won't be coming back.", "author": "Ivy W."}

Decided to eat at The House the day before running the SF RNR 1/2 marathon. I made reservations for 2 a week in a half in advance as reservations are highly recommended here. \n\nThe inside is very modern and quaint, has a homey atmosphere. For appetizers we ordered and shared the deep fried salmon and their special of the day appetizer which was clams in this yummy broth with garlic bread. I literally wanted to drink the broth, it was that good. We ended up splitting the wasabi noodle with flatiron steak (med rare).  \n\nEverything from the food presentation, flavor, and service was impeccable.  Between the both us, we still had one more deep fried salmon roll and left over wasabi noodle with steak. We were so full.  For sharing 2 appetizers and one entree,  we spent  $41. Not too shabby for a fancy Asian fusion restaurant.  Looking forward to coming back here to try the other items on the menu.", "author": "Jocelyn T."}

I discovered The House when we both lived in the Inner Sunset.

Always fresh, perfectly prepared and thoughtfully presented.\n\nEven if the space is very \"cozy\" (euphemism for small and cramped), the deliciousness is worth the sacrifice in personal space.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-12-07", "description": "12/6/14: Well, perhaps they were just \"off\" tonight, but this meal unfortunately did not live up to the hype...\n\n1. Deep-Fried Salmon Roll with Chinese Hot Mustard $10: It appears this is their most popular appetizer cause every table had one.  My friend came here often and I guess got this one many times before.  It was good--nice and tidy wrapped salmon in egg-roll skin.  But this time around the salmon was cooked mostly through and was a little drier than I would have liked.  She said is is usually  medium-rare and tonight's was just overdone.  The sauce was really great--spicy with a real kick.  The vegetable salad side tasted weird.  Was probably a fluke, but overall, nothing too special to me... 5/10.\n\n2. Creamy Shitake Mushroom Soup (tonight's special) $10: Holy cow... this is some of the best mushroom soup I've had!  Creamy yes, but still managed to have an earthy mushroom texture, and of course the very familiar shitake taste.  The whole thing was super savory and tasty.  Looks like they added some kind of oil over the top (see pictures) and though I couldn't really identify what it was, it all melted in my mouth.  Awesome.  Absolutely must have if they still have it when you come!  10/10.\n\n3. Kurobuta Pork Chop with Pomegranate Currant Sauce $26: Before I ordered this I asked the waitress if it would be dry (cause we've all had dry pork chops and they suck)--she said as long as I let the chef cook it the way he wants to, which is about \"medium\" it would be juicy and great.  Well... I dunno how \"medium\" it was, but certainly I've had juicier at other places.  Wasn't bad, but for a fancy place I expected better.  The actual pomegranate sauce and seasonings were SUPER good.  Of the sweet type pork chop sauces I've had, this is among the best.  The mashed potatoes kinda sucked and were a little plain and watery, but the oil they were served with really helped out the flavor.  The chips were pretty good--I'd love a whole bag full to snack on.  Anyway, it would have been really awesome if the meat was better prepared  (I think maybe even a 10/10 if the meat was perfect!).  6.5/10.\n\n4. Warm Wasabi House Noodles with Angus Flatiron Steak $19: This would be kinda their version of Jja Jiang Myeon (Korean Chinese noodles), topped with steak.  Given the extremely reasonable price--hell, pretty much a bargain--I think even if this dish wasn't the best, it's still quite a deal.  And well, I would say given the price it's pretty good.  The meat was super good--very high quality steak and extremely tender and flavorful.  The vegetable toppings weren't great tasting though.  And the noodles, though tasted fine, were not really what I expected from a fancy restaurant.  Jja Jiang Myeon is kinda the \"commoner's\" food, and the way they prepared it wasn't even as good as the stuff served in hole-in-the-walls.  But anyway, the steak was great and is the highlight.  Note the \"wasabi\" in the title--both me and my friend could not taste it at all!!!--but she said she got it before and definitely could taste it then.  Another fluke.\n\nThrow away all the weird tasting veggie salad they have.  Can do without the cheap noodles too.  Steak's perfect--should just make that the whole dish.\n\nToo bad the rest wasn't the same quality as the steak.  For the price, 6.5/10 (but if they charged more I'd probably lower the score).\n\n5. Blueberry Bread Pudding (tonight's special) $8.50: So, I think one's taste in bread pudding is really subjective.  I've had all kinds ranging from drowned in syrup to very dry almost like straight up loafed bread.  I'd have to say, I like mine like dessert--sweet and gooey.  But anyway, this is not that--it's the bready cakey kind.  Is about medium density and has good moisture.  The blueberry topping is good, but even with that it's not very sweet.  Maybe it's-too-sweet Asians like it this way, but it's not my kind of dessert.  5/10.\n\nI think this restaurant is a good attempt at Asian-influenced American food.  Price-wise it's a bargain, but I think the food needs a little work.\n\nBtw, this place is UBER popular.  I mean, we got there at about 5:30 and there was no line we saw and it was still a 1hr wait!  Then by the time we left there was a huge crowd outside.  I'd hate to see how long they'd have to wait.  Reservations are highly recommended!\n\nI think I'd like to come back for another try, for another chance... especially given the relatively good prices.  Definitely has potential to be much better.\n\n3/5 for tonight's subpar performance.  Hopefully next time it'll be better.\n\n#fusion #Chinese #american", "author": "Dean C."}

Get it. \n\n  I came here with friends after wandering around Chinatown and I recognized it as one of the more popular restaurants on Yelp. The outer facade was pretty simple, grey with their restaurant name on top stating, \"the house\". After peering inside through their front window and liking the cute and quiet interior, we decided to eat here! \n\n   We came maybe an hour before closing and thank god there wasn't that many people. I got the grilled sea bass and my friends got the flank steak with wasabi noodles and the pork chop, respectively. \n\n    But back to the SEA BASS! The fish of course was cooked very well. The taste was very sweet, but not the sugar type of sweet but the innate seafood type of sweet! The texture was superb too and the fish was just melt in your mouth. The garlic sauce that they had on the side provided just the right amount of flavor without being too over-bearing and didn't take away the innate taste of the sea bass. Also the texture of the sauce complimented it very well! It was a thicker kind of sauce but not too thick. \n\n    Also they add a side of garlic noodles and some greens to the fish plate. Now onto the noodles--they were really bomb. Good texture and really garlic-y like it's supposed to be. BUT a little too salty. \n\n    But really guys, the sea bass is definitely the star here.

Very tender. \n\nEntrees:\n-- Sea Bass - This is the entree my parents and I got. Loved it. Almost finished the whole thing! The sauce for the sea bass was so yummy. And the garlic noodles...weren't very garlicy but I love noodles so I didn't mind. Tasted more like chow mein.\n-- Wasabi House Noodles with Steak - My brother got this so I only tried the wasabi house noodles but they were pretty good. Didn't really taste like wasabi but had a kick to it. It was a little spicy for me but if you like spicy, you'd probably like it.\n-- Seared Ahi - My boyfriend got this and he enjoyed it but would probably get the Wasabi House Noodles with Steak next time. In my opinion, the seared ahi was pretty plain. Didn't even taste like there was salt used on it at all. He also wasn't given the option for noodles so it was plain ahi with plain rice so overall it seemed like nothing special. Would probably be great with either the garlic noodles or wasabi noodles instead to kick it up a notch but don't think they give that as an option.\n\nReservations:\n- In the past I've had so much trouble getting reservations for a couple weekends in advance for a peak dinner time but I got lucky and scored reservations at 5pm on a Sunday. They have no online reservations so you always have to call which kinda sucks. Also, because my reservations were for 7 people, it was such a \"big\" party they needed credit card information to reserve it, which I don't get why they need...but I gave it anyway because I was desperate to make the reservation and try this place. \n- Also, on the Yelp, it says it opens at 5:30pm on Sundays but on the website it says 5pm. It doesn't seem like many people come at 5pm on Sunday so that might be your best bet on the weekend if Saturdays are too crowded. \n\nService:\n- I don't know what it was but the service on the Sunday we came was not friendly at all. That's all we could talk about once we left. It was THAT noticeable. But it's so weird because not many reviews mention bad service. When we got there, it was still closed and they have no hours posted so I was confused and nervous I got the reservation time wrong. When a lady finally opened the doors, she kind of just gave us a blank stare, no friendly welcome. I just explained we had reservations and she led us to a table. Our waitresses didn't seem too happy explaining the specials to us. We noticed no one working there ever really smiled. It was just so strange. \n\nHonestly, the place is not bad, but because of how far it is, how difficult parking is, and the service, I would come back BUT I'm not RUSHING back.

I stopped by this place again for dinner with a couple of my friends, who have never been here before (WHAAT!?). Even though it was a Monday night, it got pretty busy as it got later into the night, so it's always a good idea to make reservations just in case! Oh and parking here can be a little tough but after a few circles, you should be able to find a spot. \n\nWe started off with some appetizers: the fried Salmon roll, tuna tartare, and the Hamachi sashimi. The Salmon roll is a definite must try because the Salmon is really moist and the crispy coating on the outside compliments it really well. It also comes with a wasabee dip, which I didn't really like because I'm not a fan of wasabee. The tuna tartare was really good too. The piece of chip that the tuna pieces were placed on was very tasty and eating it with the tuna tasted even better. The Hamachi sashimi had a vinegrette taste to it which was topped off with some avocado. Yumm!\n\nFor my entree I decided to try the sea bass this time, which also comes with green beans and garlic noodles. As first timers here, my friends got the wasabee noodle with the skirt steak and the tuna entree. My sea bass was seared perfectly and flaked off easily. It tasted really good with the garlic noodles and the green beans was very flavorful. The soy sauce that came with my sea bass was really good too. I dipped both my sea bass and green beans in there! :d My friends really enjoyed their entrees as well. We were all too full by the end of our meal to order dessert soooo...we decided to go to Purple Kow right after instead! :P Loll...anyways this place will always be one of my favorite gems in SF with excellent food and good service.

I didn't want to drink since I drove so I just took his word for it. \n\nMenu on 7/21/2014\nSmall:\nSelected Oysters on the half shell w/ Spicy Cilantro Mignonette: $13\nAhi Tuna Tartare w/ Roasted Nori Chips: $10\nSteamed Mussels w/ Garlic infused Shrimp Broth: $12\nWhite Shrimp & Chinese Chive Dumplings: $10\nClassic Fried Calamari: $10\nMaine Crab Cake w/ Pickled Ginger Remoulade: $12\nDeep-fried Salmon Roll w/ Chinese Hot Mustard: $10\nBlue Lake Bean Tempura w/ Pickled Ginger Soy: $9\nDeep-fried  Chicken Liver w/ Baby Greens: $9\nAsparagus w/ Roasted Sesame Dressing: $8\nCaesar Salad w/ Crispy Scallops: $11\nWhite Shrimp Tempura, Avocado, Baby Greens: $11\nCharred Baby Octopus Salad, crispy Pork Skin, Red Chili Vinaigrette: $11\n\nMain:\nWarm Wasabi House Noodles w/ Angus Flatiron Steak: $19\nMushroom Rice w/ Grilled Prawns, Shaved Bonito: $20\nGrilled Sea Bass w/ Garlic Ginger Soy: $27\nSesame Soy Glazed King Salmon in a Bonito Sake Broth: $23\nGrilled Ahi Tuna (rare) w/ Spicy Mustard Aioli: $23\nChicken Breast w/ Roasted Portabella White Truffle Oil Sauce: $19\nKurobuta Pork Chop w/ Pomegranate Currant Sauce: $25\nAngus Rib-eye Steak, house-made Teriyaki, Toasted Garlic Butter: $27\n\nDessert: \nApple Crumble Pie a la mode: $8.50\nBittersweet Chocolate Truffle Cake, Coffee Ice Cream, Coconut Caramel: $8.50\nCoconut Creme Brulee, Passion Fruit Puree: $7\nMango Tapioca: $7\nChinese Almond Cookies: ($5) To take home\n\nFor small plates we ordered the ahi tuna tartare and deep-fried salmon roll. Both were just ok. The ahi tuna tartare came out really pretty and I liked the nori chips but I would've liked some kind of zing in the tartare (whether it be spicy, bit salty, something) as it barely had any flavor. The tuna was fresh though. The roll wasn't that noteworthy as the salmon was too cooked for my liking. The bed of Chinese hot mustard that the rolls laid on tasted like really spicy kimchee.\n\nWe ordered two specials that wasn't listed on the menu (they don't have a separate paper menu for their specials, just as told by your waiter/waitress): A pork chop and a Kobe beef dish. The pork chop was slightly chewy but not too much where it was annoying. We ordered the Kobe steak medium rare, but when it came out, it came out slightly more cooked than I would've liked. It was still very tender though.\n\nFor the mains that we ordered from the menu, we had the Wasabi House Noodles w/ Angus Flatiron Steak and the Grilled Sea Bass. The noodles for both dishes were chow mein noodles, just with different sauces. The noodles for the Wasabi House tasted more like a kimchi flavor profile than wasabi but the flatiron steak was actually tender. Since the noodles had such a strong flavor, I was glad that the steak was more subtle. I really liked the noodle sauce for the grilled sea bass as it had a light soy sauce base. The sea bass was definitely my favorite of all the dishes though. It came with a garlic ginger soy on the side but the sea bass was seasoned so well, I actually preferred not to use it (which is surprised me because I'm such a huge sauce person).\n\nWe had the Mango Tapioca for dessert as one of my friends saw the pictures and really wanted to try the dessert. Very creamy and smooth, it wasn't overly sweet. Fairly good dish but not sure if it was really worth it.\n\nI came knowing this place is a fusion establishment so I wasn't expecting too much as a lot of fusion restaurants are all over the place in how good their dishes are but I've had this placed bookmarked for quite awhile. In all, the dishes were merely ok and the only item I'd get if I was to ever come back would be the Sea Bass. That dish is a definite must get!\n\nNote: limit 2 credit cards / table", "author": "Kitty K."}

But not really.\n\nAll of our appetizers were exceptionally good: the fresh scallops in lemon ponzu sauce, open-face sushi with unagi & avocado, soft shell crab tempura, and the ahi tartare.  My expectations were set high after that.\n\nUnfortunately, the entrees were lackluster.  I had the ribeye with a demi glaze and it was just a decent cut, the sauce overwhelmed any natural flavor of the meat versus complementing it. My wife's wasabi noodles with vegetables tasted downright amateurish, like an awkward veggie workaround.  Both were disappointing ultimately.  \n\nWe sampled some desserts and they were average, ending the meal with a bland whimper.  \n\nService was subpar.  We were running a few minutes late and told our table would only be held for 10 mins.  So we got there just a few mins past -and then proceeded to wait 10+ mins for our table! Why couldn't they just tell us no problem, they were running late too?\n\nOur waitress was fine but couldn't remember if the ribeye was bone-in or not and called an upside down cake a turnover.  She seemed indifferent to the distinction.\n\nWe asked one server pouring water if she knew if the side rice noodles with sauce  served were vegetarian or not and she said they were \"rice noodles\".  Er, yeah, didn't mean to imply the rice noodles were made of meat, lady; was asking you about the sauce.  She said she wasn't sure and walked away.  Rude. Thanks for nothing lady! \n\nIf the service wasn't bad, this place may have squeaked out 4 stars based on the apps but I can't do it, too many things wrong.", "author": "Saminda W."}

We got into SF late and were looking for a place that was close to our hotel. 3500 reviews on yelp with 4.5 stars...how could you go wrong!? I think we got really lucky -- it was a Wednesday night -- they had a reservation. It was packed. Everything came out really quickly and everything was awesome. Hubby said it was one of his top 5 favorite meals! The fried salmon rolls were so good -- not greasy, salmon cooked perfectly! The hamachi special appetizer was excellent -- 5 really big slices of hamachi with a really good avocado topping. The kale salad was amazing (hubby even ate it and liked it!) -- thin ribbons of kale with cheese and pistachios. As others have said, the special black cod was so good -- silky, delicious tasting, and it came with a crab roll that was really good, a slight twist on a California roll. Also, the sauce that comes with it is really good. Everyone at the table will fight over it! And, the salmon entree was also good. Oh, the entrees came with greens and they were so good (again, couldn't believe that hubby was fighting with me for the veg!). Everything was just a little different than what you have had somewhere else, which made it that much better. \n\nAlso, service was great.\n\nUpdate: Our second visit was just as good as our first! We had many of the same things and everything was awesome. We tried the sea bass that is on the menu. So good! It was buttery tasting with a perfect crust. The sauce it came with was delicious. And, typical of this restaurant the veggies that it came with were so good -- I LOVED the green beans!! Dad loved the pork chop. The special sashimi appetizer was amazing! It rivaled any sushi place that we have eaten at. The hamachi was melt in your mouth. The scallop appetizer was also amazing -- cooked perfectly and amazing flavors. The House is AWESOME. Everything is always delicious -- super interesting flavors. Husband said he could eat there every day for the rest of his life and be happy! :)", "author": "Jen G."}

Small joint around the corner and definitely impossible to find parking during rush hour. Just walk there if you're nearby! Lighting was too dimmed for our party. There's only 1 big window by the doorway and I wish we were by the window. \n\nSalmon roll, deep fried to medium: A lot of guests enjoy this dish, but it wasn't for me. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but I don't like my salmon deep fried. \n\nWasabi noodles and flat iron steak: It may sound a little weird, but those wasabi noodles were goooooood! Right about of wasabi flavor with a little bit of the steak and the vegetables. Perfect bite. There was also fresh cucumber in the dish that kinda of gave some freshness. \n\nPorkchop with pomegranate and current reduction: It may sound a little sweet, but this was definitely my favorite dish out of everything. The porkchop had a nice sear, cooked to medium with a touch of pink. Tender, juicy, had a little fat and just tasty. \n\nRibeye with toasted garlic butter: It was huge ribeye steak! Can't go wrong with steak, teriyaki sauce and garlic butter. Cooked to medium rare, tender and the garlic butter added extra flavor to it.

These were a bit greasy for me, but the mustard and kimchee helped it. Finally, we had the scallops.

It comes with a dipping sauce that has hints of wasabi that works really well together.\n\nWhen available, the Seared Scallops comes in three huge pieces of scallops, lightly seared and dressed in a refreshing light citrus sauce.\n\nThe Rib Eye is a bit on the pricier side but cooked to perfection at medium rare.

It's not as if The House needs another positive review to convince people the food is good, but I can chime in that the place has been *consistently* great for over a decade. I can't even recall when I first went to The House, but I want to say it was early 2000's before the dot com bubble burst. It's always been a popular lunch spot for those who work in the North Beach/Financial District/Chinatown area, and is a great place to take clients given it's a little on the upscale side (all tables have white table cloths), but not too fancy. The restaurant itself is pretty small with the tables fairly close to each other in that NYC kind of way. The food though...simply wonderful. My personal favorites are the warm wasabi noodles with grilled salmon or the sea bass with ginger soy, and curry noodles are great as well. All of the dishes are perfectly spiced and offer just the right \"kick\" without it being overbearing. This is definitely a go-to lunch spot for me, and on my top ten list of favorite SF places.

I honestly still think about this dish from time to time and its been a few months since I've been here. The dish comes with some veggies and noodles I think, they were probably tasty but the only thing I remembered was how that soft buttery sea bass melted in my mouth. Ermahgad foodgasm for sure. One complaint I have is that the soy/ginger sauce that they give you to add to the seabass was WAY too salty. I could only handle a few drops from dipping my fork into the sauce and dripping it on to the piece of fish. For the most part I did not use the sauce. Would've been excellent if they made it more savory sweet with ginger than excruciatingly salty. Its a minor hiccup though, I would still get the bass. I'm all about that bass, bout that bass. YUUUM. \n\nThe salmon eggroll thing they had was good too, the yellowish sauce it comes with is wasabi base or wasabi tasting so beware. I was not warned lol. The appetizer was tasty and flaky, I liked.\n\nMy friend got the special halibut - it was good! I liked that a lot too. Another friend got the wagyu steak, and another got the steak wasabi noodles. The wasabi noodles did not taste like wasabi so don't be scared. Everyone loved their food, we made a good choice. The food was good and the prices reasonable. We had 4 entrees and 2 appetizers 1 drink, price came out to be around $180 tip included. I would definitely come back, in fact was planning on taking my boyfriend the next time he visits!

Make sure you get a reservation a few days in advance because it does get overly crowded at the restaurant and getting a table is quite difficult unless you arrive there right when the doors open. Reservations are held up to 15 minutes and trust me, those extra 15 minutes count because finding parking in North Beach is a pain. The restaurant is small and cramped and you are literally sitting elbow to elbow with other customers. With the dining area aside, let's get onto the food.\n\nWhenever The House has the scallops as an appetizer special, Get it! It is an amazing starter with three big scallops, micro greens and with a lemon butter sauce. Other highlights is definitely the pork chop with the pomegranate sauce and the mushroom rice. The pork chop is one of the most amazing pork dishes I ever had. The pork chop is juicy and tender with plenty of sauce as well. It's a pretty dish with two towers of crispy taro and a potato salad with carrots. I have also tried the miso sea bass, wasabi noodles and even the coconut creme bruleee with passion fruit puree. Pretty much everything I have tried here exceeded my expectations. The amount of flavors from each dish gives your taste buds a little dance and makes you want more. \n\nThe staff is very nice and they are very quick with clearing your table as well. The tables are quite small and when you order a lot of food, it takes up the entire table. There's nothing else I can say that hasn't been said already.

Walked in, and the 3 of us was sat down with in a couple minutes. So glad we made reservations because it was packed, even on a Sunday night!\n\nWe started off with their daily special appetizers. My boyfriend ordered the shrimp and chive dumplings, which he loved and I ordered the asparagus with sesame dressing. I love asparagus and they did it just perfectly. Fried carrots on top, which a light sauce, I couldn't get enough. I almost considered ordering another. \n\nAll 3 of us ordered steaks. My boyfriend and his friend ordered that nights special Kobe steak in a mushroom sauce. They absolutely loved every single bite. Although they couldn't finish the plate, both said it would be a dish they would order again. \n\nI got the angus rib eye with house teriyaki. And it was just simply amazing on my tongue. I basically finished my plate which is a huge deal for me because I'm a very petite girl. The meat was just cooked perfectly and the teriyaki wasn't what I expected at all. It was subtle, great with the vegetables, and the meat just soaked up all the juices at the bottom. If I could, I would eat that plate weekly. \n\nFor dessert, we snuck a chocolate truffle cake. They even put a candle in it for my boyfriends birthday! That was super nice since most places I've looked at doesn't do birthdays. \n\nOur waitress was so nice. She helped us out through everything and we had tons of questions which she was on top of. I didn't like my alcohol I ordered and she recommended me a different one which I did enjoy! \n\nOverall, we LOVED our experience. Already planning another visit within the next two weeks. As for price, I'm a chef myself so the price is actually reasonable. I recommended this place to anyone who wants to experience a great meal worth the money. If you're wallet is tight, save up because it's definitely a place to try.", "author": "Abbie F."}

At 9 PM on a weekday the place was fully packed and there were people outside waiting to get seated.  We had taken reservations and were seated right away. Our server explained the specials of the day to us. Having read some of the Yelp reviews, I wanted to try out the dishes that everyone was raving about. We ordered the deep fried salmon roll and seared scallops for appetizer. Loved both the dishes, esp the salmon rolls were so crispy and delicious. For entree I ordered the grilled sea bass with garlic noodles and my husband ordered the warm wasabi noodles flatiron steak. I was really keen to try out the sea bass after the reviews on Yelp and was not disappointed, the fish was very well cooked and moist, and the garlic noodles were to die for. I actually liked the garlic noodles more than the fish itself. Remember to dip the fish in the sauce they give, it accentuates the flavor of the fish manyfold. My husband liked his dish too, both the steak and the noodles tasted very good. The portions of the entree were big, we ended up packing some of the food home. \nOverall a great culinary experience, worth the money spent. Will go back again for the awesome food. Service was great, despite being so busy the servers were attentive. It can get a bit noisy with the place being small and full, but you tend to forget the noise when you get served such delicious food!!", "author": "Vidisha S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-06-19", "description": "Make reservations and must try: Black Cod and Garlic Noodles\n\nThe Black Cod is not on their regular menu, but it must be a frequent special since so many people have tried it. It was melt-in-your-mouth soft and tender. The sauce that went with it was perfect and didn't take away the flavor of the fish. They give you a generous piece of fish, and also two pieces of crab sushi on top. The sushi was alright, nothing too spectacular, but the cod was probably one of the best fish entrees I've ever had. The garlic noodles are separate, and they come as a side in the seabass entree. However, the seabass wasn't as good as the black cod so I wouldn't recommend it unless that's the only way you can try the garlic noodles. The garlic noodles are your basic Chinese chow mien, but better. Not oily and not too salty. They are perfectly flavored with garlic and soy sauce, but for some reason I couldn't get enough of it.\n\nWe also tried the soft shell crab appetizer, which was alright. The noodles that went with it were way too salty, but the crab was very tender and juicy. It also came with a sauce that was completely unnecessary because the crab was already seasoned. I think in general, most of the dishes at The House are pretty heavily seasoned and on the saltier side, but I do believe Americans are used to the heavy flavors, so it makes sense.\n\nFor dessert, we got the apple pie a la mode. It came with a small scoop of vanilla that was half melted because the apple pie was really warm. The apple pie was completely unstructured because of the nice crumble top. I really think this was the best slice of apple pie I've ever had. I'm always afraid apple pie is too tart or too sweet. However, this apple pie had the perfect combination of both flavors. My favorite part was the crumble top. I don't normally like to get the same things over again, but I'm pretty sure my next visit I'd get the apple pie again. Overall, I can see why this place is so popular because the food is very fresh and made very well but just slightly overly seasoned.\n\nService was excellent. It definitely helps that the restaurant is tiny, but I really felt like our waitress was always within reach. Water was always refilled, and food came really quick as well. There are lots of good restaurants in the area, but the black cod is a must try here!", "author": "Debbie O."}

The crab cake was fine, but not out of this world. It had a very nice presentation, but it had average flavor. The blue lake bean tempura is just green bean tempura that, in my opinion, is not worth ordering. The hamachi appetizer, however, was delightful - a very fresh and vibrant dish that I wish they had on their permanent menu. \n\nFor entrees, we ordered the wasabi house noodles, the kurobuta pork chop, and the sea bass. The sea bass was perfectly cooked with a wonderful flavor. I didn't enjoy the other two entrees as much though. The wasabi house noodles were uninspiring (although the steak was well cooked) and I personally didn't like the pork chop with the pomegranate sauce. I didn't think the combination of flavors worked together; it was too sweet for me. I probably wouldn't order either of those two dishes again. \n\nBut in general, I like this place. It's small and crowded, but they service a lot of people with generally flavorful and unique dishes. It was definitely upscale, but not pretentious and the meal didn't break the bank. It was a little under $130 for a family of four including tax and tip (no drinks).", "author": "Kimberly S."}

How in the world did this restaurant get such high reviews.  Is the Asian fusion food so bad in San Francisco that this is the best.  I cannot believe it.  Sometimes I think that a place's vibe and past reviews inflate the reality of a place's food and future reviews.  And, when going to eat dinner, the food and service come first, then the vibe; not the other way around.\n\nWhen I walked in, I was quickly seated (I had a reservation).  The waitress immediately told me the evening's specials.  She did not ask if I wanted a drink (which is something I like, so she got an extra point for not asking me about a drink before I have a chance to look at the menu); I did not even have a glass of water on the table yet; nor had I picked up the menu.  I literally sat down, took my coat off and she began telling me the specials. \n\nI ordered the scallop appetizer.  It was one of the specials.  The dish came within a few minutes, less than 10.  I should have thought something was funny.  There were 3 scallops on the plate.  The sauce was tasty.  2 of the 3 scallops tasted good, although I thought they tasted a little bland (they really, really needed the sauce on the plate).  The third scallop was completely under cooked.\n\nI ordered the sea bass.  If anyone thinks this is the best sea bass they ever had, etc., I really feel sorry for you.  This sea bass was, frankly, small and plain.  There was absolutely nothing special about this sea bass.  It was not tastier, softer, oiler, etc. then the sea bass I can get at my local supermarket.  1/4 of the top of the sea bass was burnt (no joke).  Yes, I could eat the sea bass with just the fork, no knife required.  But, that is the way it is supposed to be.  Thank goodness for the soy sauce with some garlic to dip the plain tasting sea bass into. The string beans and noodles were flooded, and I mean flooded, in soy sauce.  Other than being flooded with the sauce, I could not taste any other flavor on the noodles or beans.  I will say that both the noodles and beans were cooked perfectly.\n\nI had the special dessert of the night, chocolate bread pudding.  This was enjoyable.  I could have eaten another dish of this bread pudding.\n\nThe prices were reasonable for a restaurant trying to be upscale, casual.  The service was outstanding.  I wish they had some of the wines that came by the bottle sold by the glass.\n\n\n\nNow, for the vibe.  No doubt, the vibe of this place is humming.  However, I did feel like all the tables near my table were tourists.", "author": "Robert S."}

I realize that most people would've found this to be a pleasant surprise. I didn't. I ate the shrimp and not the rice. \n2) miso cod (special):  we got it for Jovi. The server even noticed that we called her Jovi and referred to her by name all night. Great service!  The sauce had too much wasabi in it for her, but we loved it!

Omg. Seared ahi tuna with wasabi noodles. Need I say more?! The noodles were soft and blasting with flavor. I'm sensitive to spices so I kept grabbing water as I continuously devoured it but so worth it! Ahi tuna was seared to perfection.

Their food speaks for itself. \n\nSome tips to start out: \n1. Definitely, definitely, definitely make a reservation. This place is tiny. And since this place has a well known reputation its pretty busy pretty much all the time. \n2. Corkage fee is $26 I believe. We brought our own bottle of wine. \n\nNow. For in regards to other detail:\n\nAfter doing my research on Yelp, I made some educated recommendations to the rest of my group and this is what we ended up getting: \nAppetizers:\n1.  deep fried salmon roll with mustard sauce: it was pretty good. I wouldn't say amazing, but it was tasty. the mustard sauce has a pretty good horseradish kick so if you're not into that I wouldn't douse the appetizer with it. \n2. Grilled octopus, tempura potatoes, sriracha aioli: this stuff was bomb! Highly highly recommend this dish. We were originally going to go with the caesar salad with scallops but when we asked the server he recommended the octopus dish and we are so glad we asked. The grilled octopus was cooked perfectly. So tender and smokey from the grill and the accompanying sriracha aioli was creamy and a little spicy but not overpowering. The dish also came with fried potato and avocado. Overall it was the perfect comfort appetizer without being super filling. \n\nEntrees: \n1. Grilled Sea Bass, garlic ginger soy with a side of their wasabi noodles: This dish came with serving of the grilled sea bass and a side of noodles and green beans. I had a taste of the sea bass and it was so tender and flaky. Absolute perfection! Their execution was on point! Highly recommend! \n2. (2 orders of) the Warm Wasabi noodles with angus flatiron steak: This dish was highly recommended on Yelp so two people in my group wanted to order it. Both people were happy with their dish. The noodles were really tasty but I was expecting more wasabi taste to them since they are advertised as wasabi noodles. I didn't try the steak since I'm a pescatarian but both said their steak was cooked perfectly. The only complaint I got, was my fiancee said his dish wan't super hot when he received it, but other than that it was a solid dish. \n3. Mushroom rice, grilled prawns, shaved bonito: This was the dish I ordered. It was delicious. The mushroom rice was more like risotto with mushroom and carrots and peas. It was creamy, cheesy and absolutely delicious. It came with 4 large shrimp that were grilled and cooked perfectly. My sister who ordered the steak with the noodles said she actually preferred my dish to hers! Since the rice is really filling I was able to take home some leftovers! \n\nThe House's strength and winning factor is definitely their ability to execute their proteins out to perfection.

They popped it open and allowed my girlfriend to taste it. The cups however were not wine glasses I would have liked as it was a low bulb wine glass. This as well did not bother me too much. Just an observation and my own personal preference. \n\nMy girlfriend and I ordered the deep fried soft shell crab with tomatoe sauce on noodles. That was pleasant and looked more like a sculpture from Michaelangelo than food! Looked good and tasted good. Very pleased.\n\nWe also ordered the clams. It tasted soooo good! Had what tasted a bit like curry with coconut milk and jalepenos and spicy peppers. The clams and borth was delicious! It came with some bread so it was nice to be able to dip the bread and enjoy the borth :)\n\nI had ordered the U.S Kobe styled short ribs that was their special. That was AMAZINGGGG! The sauce was sweet and savory and the beef was cooked to perfection! (I ordered rare/medium rare and it was still nice and bloody. :D ) This paired very well with my bottle of Roebert Craig Affinity cab!\n\nMy girlfriend had ordered the Sea bass with wasabi noodles. That was out of this world as well! The exterior of the fish was nice and dry.. looked like it was over cooked but the minute I sank my teeth into that I knew I was dead wrong! The inside was so juicy and flavorful! The wasabi noodles was quite delicious as well! However the wasabi part wasn't so major as I only tasted a hint of wasabi at the very end. Either way, it still tasted amazing!\n\nAll in all, it was an amazing experience and the food was phenomenal! I will definitely make my way here again!", "author": "Calvin Y."}

I did not expect the restaurant to be so small but that didn't really matter because we were seated within 15 minutes and we got a table near the wall so it was very comfortable. \n\nWe ordered the deep fried soft shell crab, mussels in a broth, halibut in white truffle oil sauce with corn and mashed potatoes, and the popular wasabi noodles with steak. The dinner portions are generous. You're getting a good amount of food for the price that you pay. It's not even that expensive here compared to the other SF restaurants. Great quality and quantity.\n\nSoft shell crab: a soft shell crab deep fried with a light batter, served with a small amount of these slightly sweet thin noodles and a dipping sauce. The sauce was really good. It complimented the crab very well and did not take away the seafood flavor. It's not on the menu but it seems to be part of their \"Daily Specials\" quite frequently.\n\nMussels in a broth: the mussels inside the broth were plump and cooked perfectly. The broth had a rather strong shrimp flavor to it and it was tasty; however, I thought it was very salty. You can't eat too much of it.\n\nHalibut: this was part of the \"Daily Special\" and it was the show stopper. It was amazing. The sauce that sat under the fish was one of the best things I have ever tasted. It had a truffle flavor with sweet corn added to it. The mashed potatoes is not your average and the fish was flakey and moist. The fish is freaking huge too. It was about the size of a hand. I would most definitely be back for this dish.\n\nWasabi Noodles w/ Steak: we ordered this because it seems to be the most popular. The steak was cooked perfectly but it lacked a little flavor. I'm assuming its because the flavor is suppose to be more in the noodles. The noodles were like thick udon noodles with a slight wasabi taste which I enjoyed. It was more sweet than spicy. Actually wasn't spicy at all. This dish did not particularly stand out to me and I probably wouldn't get it again. I can see why it is popular though, the flavor is different from other noodle dishes I've tried. It is also one of the cheaper ones! Lol.\n\nSorry I don't have any pictures.

I was so surprised at all the hype on this place. \n\nI had the wasabi noodles with steak (ordered medium-rare) and what arrived was red chili covered chow-mein noodles with well done sliced steak (not a hint of wasabi). My friend ordered the shortribs, only to be told they were actually sold out of shortribs (which is strange, as we were there literally right when they opened) and opted for a skirt steak and mashed potatoes instead -- her steak was also chewy and overcooked. \n\nLychee iced tea was nice, but for 71$ we certainly wouldn't go back. Bar across the street is sketchy and we got to enjoy watching a crackhead urinate all over the sidewalk right infront of the front door, and have multiple homeless people scream into the restaurant.

Any time friends or family come to visit, this is the first place that I bring them. The food is gorgeous, perfectly balanced and flavor-forward. They have a nice selection of sakes, wines and beers that meld well with the food. The service is spot on. Each time I visit, I am more and more impressed. Especially when I consider the very reasonable pricing - the value is so much higher at The House than in most SF restaurants.\n\nEverything on the menu is delicious, but the seafood dishes are truly remarkable. The deep fried salmon roll is a lovely appetizer to share. The unagi is next level, the best I've had. The warm wasabi noodles with flatiron steak, kurobuta pork chop, and the grilled sea bass are my favorite entrees. Be sure to ask about their specials because I can guarantee they are fantastic and fresh.\n\nThe restaurant is small and intimate. For dinner, a reservation is highly recommended as they do not have a bar where you can wait. I like to go for lunch; the dishes are largely the same and you typically don't need a reservation.

We than got the Soft shelled crab which was crispy on the outside & creamy on the inside. I didn't get a chance to taste the noodles before the plate got taken away but they looked really good. We moved on to a Kale salad which was warm & had bleu cheese. Neither is what I am used to but somehow the result was amazing. Our last appetizer was the Deep friend salmon roll courtesy of the owners. These were crispy on the outside but still semi-raw on the inside. It's genius.\n\nFor main course I had the Halibut with truffle cream sauce. The fish was nicely cooked, the mashed potato was addicting, & the sauce was creamy without being heavy.\n\nAnd if all that food wasn't enough, we started off our multiple dessert course with a Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. The coconut flavor was not very strong but that's alright. My favorite was the passion fruit puree which provided a nice tart contrast to the creamy, rich custard. We moved on next to the Chocolate truffle cake which I only have 3 letters for: O. M.

The food was delicious, but the service I would have to say was very subpar. I went with a friend for dinner and we didn't get much because we were stuffed from our food adventures from earlier, but it was really good! \n\nPlace: The place is pretty tiny and could probably fit at most maybe 40ish people? So yes, reservations are a must. If you walk in, you will have to wait like two hours. IF you get a spot. \n\nParking: Don't expect to park here.. I think if I were you and I was having a day trip here to park near Chinatown and have a little walk around there before you have dinner because it's pretty close to it. \n\nService: Our waiter seemed a little scatterbrained and could not for the life of him remember the specials of the day and had to keep sneaking glances at the little piece of paper he \"discreetly\" hid in a checkbook. Subtle. And he wasn't very attentive with refilling our teapots at all. Which, of course, wasn't free at all.. I think I had to pay like $4 for it. \n\nSeared tuna: Very nice and soft. I was very impressed with this dish because they seared it in a way that it felt like it was melting in my mouth. \nOctopus salad: Eh, I wasn't as impressed with this. It was still good and had nice flavor and wasn't overly strong on the vinegar, but the deep fried tofu skins were not the business. It kind of ruined the salad for me, to be honest. \n\nI would probably go again because their fusion food is pretty good, but maybe not one of those places I would go out of my way for.", "author": "Jackie S."}

If I had to choose one place to eat my last meal on earth it would definitely be here. Make sure you make reservations for dinner because the place gets super packed. I usually come for lunch since reservations are not required and the price is a bit cheaper. This place is located near North Beach, in a small alley. The place is intimate and the tables are squeezed tightly. \n\nAll the dishes I usually order are delicious. I usually get the wasabi noodles with steak. The noodles are perfectly flavored and you can taste the wasabi. The sea bass is another favorite. The texture of the sea bass is perfect. Crispy on the outside and melts in your mouth on the inside. I occasionally order the special. The most recent dish was the Kobe beef with black truffle. The meat was a perfect medium rare with a real earthy taste.  Another excellent dish was the halibut, seared crispy on a bed of shrimp swimming in red curry.  It was quite possibly the best halibut I have ever had in my life.\n\nYou can't go wrong with anything you order. I'm usually satisfied with what I order. The only thing that I wish was still on their menu was the Unagi sandwich. Overall, customer service has always been great and the staff is super friendly.

In fact, I would say I have been eating at his establishments for close to 20 years.  They even catered both baby parties for my kids who are now 15 and 12 with their famed wasabi noodles.\n\nI recently took some out of town colleagues and went with my go-to wasabi steak noodles for my entree.  So GOOD!  Why had I waited so long to return?  We started with scallops and dumplings.  My colleague had the sea bass which he said was the best fish he ever tasted,  He had never had it before and said it was his new favorite fish.  \n\nWhile I knew I was going to enjoy my meal this review is really based upon my colleague who has international tastes, prefers their Asian food really spicy and in large quantities.  He ate everything and kept looking at the menu for more things that he wanted to try, but we didn't have a lot of time.  The best part is that he said that we need to go back again so he can try the halibut which he kept looking at on our neighbor's plate.\n\nProbably he reason I don't go here as often anymore is that with a family of four, reservations are needed in advance and the place is very small and there are usually waits.

Because of that, it's a challenge for their server to deliver any dishes to the table. It's understandable, but their server did it in the rudest way possible. The server came to our table with our dishes, didn't say a word to anyone at the table, and pushed my head away using his elbow, before bringing the plate directly over my head. I had to experience that 4 times for the 4 dishes we ordered. It was NOT a pleasant experience at all. The waitress who was in charge of the ordering process was acting like we owe her money the whole time she was taking our order, there is no single bit of professionalism in that encounter.

One of my other favorites here is the kurobuta pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce, which comes with mashed potatoes and asparagus. That sauce is delicious, and it really works well with the pork chop. \n\nI've also tried the wasabi house noodle with flat iron steak, the deep fried salmon roll with chinese hot mustard, and the spicy miso clams. The house noodle with steak is not bad, but it definitely has no comparison to the sea bass and pork chop. The salmon roll is pretty good, and that sauce gives it a nice kick. The broth of the spicy miso clams is delicious. It also comes with bread for you to dip it in, so you can soak up the broth. The downside of this dish is that they are very stingy with the clams. There was very little clams as it is, and most of them were just empty shells.\n\nThe service here is a hit or a miss. I remember the first few times I came here, it was great, however, last night was a different experience. There was a Caucasian lady who was kind of rude throughout the whole night. She also took my plate without asking when there was still noodles left, and my friend was going to finish it for me. Later on, she came back and asked us if we were done, with an attitude, then dropped the check at our table without having a smile or saying thank you. There was also an African American waiter who also seemed like he was unhappy. My co worker asked him if they had any Japanese beers there. He walked away without saying anything (not even a yes or a no), then comes back and puts the beer on our table, then walked away without saying anything again. No \"here you go\", no name of the beer, couldn't even get a smile out of him. Umm okay.......

It was recommended to me by a co-worker and now I'm preaching it to the world. Even before you finish reading my review, make your reservation NOW!\n\nFOOD - 5 Stars:\n\n- House Pickles: This was simple, but yet so flavorful. It was a nice way to get your taste buds jumping before your meal.\n\n- Deep Fried Salmon Roll: I wasn't sure what to expect with this, but it was so good. It's almost like a salmon egg roll if you want to think of it that way, but the salmon is not dry or anything. It's delicious and moist! This probably surprised me the most.\n\n- Maine Crab Cakes: I'm the biggest crab cake lover in the world. The crab cake had a crispy crusting all around was full of flavor. It was also very moist and not dry at all. It was truly a great way to start the meal. \n\n- Sea Bass with Noodles and Green Beans: This was insanely delicious. The sea bass was a huge portion, cooked to perfection, and as flakey as can be. It was the best I've ever had! The noodles and green beans were an awesome compliment to the sea bass. The ginger garlic soy sauce was really good with this too. This meal was probably the highlight of my San Francisco trip! I think everyone should order this dish... it's the BEST!\n\nSERVICE - 5 Stars: This place is crazy busy even at 9PM when we were able to get a reservation. The staff did a great job of taking care of us the entire night. There were so friendly and patient especially since we didn't know what to order. It was an amazing night and they did a great job.\n\nATMOSPHERE - 5 Stars: This is the perfect place to have a date or even a small group together.

It's a small restaurant situated on a small street at North Beach with a packed house most of the time.\n\nThis is Asian Fusion dining at its finest. I love coming here both lunch and dinner, with lunch having some of the popular dinner dishes at cheaper prices. Some of my favorite dishes are the wasabi noodles, sea bass, and Kurobuta pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce. I personally do not like eating anything with wasabi unless it's with soy sauce and sashimi, but you do not taste the wasabi in the noodles. The noodles are saucy, but not overly saucy. The sea bass is phenomenal! It's super soft, and it's seasoned very well. The pork chop is also delicious and sweet when paired with the pomegranate sauce.\n\nFor appetizers, I really like the steamed mussels with garlic broth. They also had a special of oysters that had their own type of soy sauce that you put on your oysters, and it tasted amazing. I would opt out on the fried calamari; the breading falls off of the calamari, which defeats the purpose of a \"fried\" calamari. I also tried the deef fried salmon rolls based on the reviews, and they were just ok. Nothing really wowed me about them. \n\nI also tried the mango tapioca for dessert based on the reviews. If you like mango pudding with small tapioca, this is good for you. I eat this many times at Chinese restaurants, so this was whatever to me.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place for any occasion, special or casual!

Based on the reviews I went here.  All I am going to say is wow.  I now have a place I will always visit when I am in San Francisco.  Coincidentally I sat next to a couple that was from Florida that said they always come here when they visit their children. \n\nI can see why.  This restaurant has great food, great atmosphere, and a friendly and knowledgeable staff (that eat there too so they explain things perfectly pertaining to the menu).  \n\nOur group had the marinated rib eye, skirt steak, seared scallops, tempura salmon, apple crumble desert, seared ahi. \n\nIt was all cooked perfectly with a lot of great flavors.  My ribeye was very tender, and if I had the chance, I would have took 10 of them home with me, and just sat in front of a TV eating them ... they were that good.  Also the scallops, wow ... I am terrible at cooking those things but they got it just right with a light sauce that didn't mar the tender peaks of its flavor.  \n\nFIVE STARS!!!  ... this place is joining my restaurant city book for places that I will definitely always go to when in the area.", "author": "David L."}

They were all good, but not super amazing.\n\nThe sea bass was definitely on point. It was cooked well and had a great flavor, I preferred this over the pork chop, which was also good, but why is the menu so small if you can't NAIL the dish? The salmon roll I think is what really kind of just pissed me off about the whole thing. Yelp failed me on this recommendation horribly. I did not think this was a good dish at all. It was just a piece of well cooked salmon in a deep fried roll. I used all of the horseradish sauce to make it actually tasty. \n\nBottom line for me: There are a ton of other restaurants in the area you could drop $25-40/person that would be WAY better.", "author": "Alex K."}

Out of all the restaurants in SF, I chose to go here for my graduation dinner last year. I made reservations a month in advance. I called the week of to make sure my reservations were still there. I kept gushing to everyone about how I was finally going to try this amazing little restaurant in North Beach. Unfortunately, my evening didn't really go as planned. The poor service really spoiled everything for me and overshadowed the food. No, I didn't have a super rude server, or find a foreign object in my food. It was more about the neglect and failure to meet the standards of their glowing reviews and delicious food.\n\nIn the beginning, our server was speaking so fast and it was so loud in the restaurant that we could barely hear the specials for that day. Once we ordered, the food initially came out pretty fast. First the soft shell crab appetizer after about 10 minutes and then the main entrees 15 minutes after that. All 3 entrees...except we ordered 4. We waited another 10 minutes hoping it would arrive, but after no luck I flagged down another server and asked about the missing dish. After a quick kitchen check I could see from my seat that it hadn't been ordered, but he told the chef. He didn't return to our table though to update us and didn't apologize for it either. Another 10 minutes rolled by and the dish finally arrived. Again no apology, no smile. We didn't get checked on throughout the rest of the meal. I had to catch a server's attention to ask for more water when our glasses ran empty and then again for the check at the end.\n\nThe food was beautifully presented and well-prepared; moist and flaky fish, tender steak, yummy noodles...but flavor wise, nothing stood out to me and everything was so salty. Maybe I was still annoyed about the missing food from earlier, but I was very unimpressed with everything. And you'd think they would have paid a little more attention to us considering we were all dressed up and I had a giant bouquet of flowers smothering me. I held off on this review for such a long time because I felt like my experience was a fluke. I'm willing to give them one more shot...but until then...The House left me very disappointed on what was suppose to be a joyous and celebratory occasion.", "author": "Deanna Y."}

We were 20 min late for our reservation (called to let them know we'd be late) and they graciously held our table, despite a line going out the door. Big thumbs up to them for being so accommodating. We did our best to compensate them by having drinks, apps, entrees, desserts and tea (such a hardship for us!). Delicious from top to bottom, especially the grilled octopus appetizer--I could have licked the plate it was so good!\n\nThe menu is interesting--Asian fusion, but with some French accents as well. I had the wasabi noodles with beef--perfectly cooked, not spicy (as I requested--you could definitely request heat); hubby had the ribeye and said the spices were a little heavy handed, but very tasty. Dad had the pork chops, and I nearly swapped plates with him, they were so good. I normally never order pork chops as they're ALWAYS dry for me, even when medium rare, but these were just moist and awesome.\n\nWe then finished with yummy apple crumble/pie, bittersweet chocolate cake, and my favorite, coconut passionfruit creme brulee--to die for!\n\nConsidering all we ate/drank, $240 wasn't too bad, but it's definitely not a cheap night out. Would absolutely return when I'm in the area.

If this is your first time, I promise that you will be mind blown. \n\nWhere do I even begin? I have to admit that the place is small, but you can already tell by the outside that it's going to be a beautiful experience. My family and I began with 2 appetizers: steamed muscles and scallops. Both appetizers were bursting with flavors that still have me wondering how so many flavors can go so well with each other. I love dissecting ingredients in a dish, and this was one of the few times I couldn't. For my main course, I had the Kurobuta Pork Chop, and it was cooked to perfection. It was a little bit more towards medium well (even though I asked for medium), but nonetheless, the pork was extremely juicy. Finally, for dessert, we had the panna cotta with oranges (special of the day), and it just melts in your mouth like butter.

Bringing my mom here for a nice dinner before she left the country, our meal consisted primarily of appetizers, where we ordered the:\n\n* Ahi Tuna Tartare - Tuna tartare on nori chips, and highly reminiscent of a similar dish that you could find at the Liholiho Yacht Club popup, but not nearly in the same league. Enjoyable, but not particularly memorable.\n\n* Deep Fried Salmon Roll - Essentially salmon egg rolls, which is hard to completely butcher. That said, while these weren't bad, they were on the salty side of the spectrum, especially when one being too liberal with the accompanying dipping sauce.\n\n* Seared Scallops in Ponzu Sauce - Hands down the best part of the meal, and drastically better than the rest of the dishes, with the scallops cooked just right, and sauced to perfection.\n\n*  Wasabi House Noodles w/ Flat Iron Steak - One of the other stars of the restaurant (the other being the salmon rolls), this turned out to be a bit lacking as well. While decent, we found it lacking in wasabi flavoring, and also found it oddly reminiscent of Taiwanese black bean noodles. So much so, in fact, that every bite ended with the expectation and consequent dissatisfaction that they were not actually black bean noodles, falling just a bit short of that flavoring.\n\nNow, if The House were at a lower price point, and in a place that had easier parking, I'd easily give it 3 stars, because really, the food is pretty average. But, because of the difficulty in parking, and because it IS meant to be a fancy dinner (with prices reflecting that), I can't see myself coming here again.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - A bit on the fence about the accessibility of the place. While there is a large single, angled step to get inside, they do have a ramp they can bring out. And, while the tables are placed close enough that maneuvering around can prove difficult, they can set you up at a table near the front, with enough notice.\n\nBathroom - I didn't check them out, so I can't say for sure, but even if they were accessible, getting to them could prove a bit troublesome.", "author": "Johnny W."}

And it's dark inside. And on a not very clean looking street. BUT OH WELL I'd still come here in a heart beat!\n\nI came here for dinner with my girlfriend and arrived a little early. First tip: you will probably have to park a few blocks away since it is a hugely busy street, so arrive early enough to have time to find a spot and walk here. Second tip: make reservations. DEFINITELY MAKE RESERVATIONS. There aren't a lot of tables in here, and wait times can get pretty long, especially since this isn't a place that is great for groups. We made a reservation and actually arrived about a half hour before. I talked to a waitress and she actually had us seated within 10 minutes because a table freed up (and the other groups that showed up were all 3+). Yay for us!\n\nWe were seated and explained the specials of the night, all of which sounded really good. Our waitress was extremely attentive and courteous to us especially when I forgot what the specials were twice. \n\nTo start I got a bowl of the truffle mushroom soup which was one of the best I've ever had. It was creamy and rich and had a great aroma where the truffle really came through but was still really well balanced. I'm actually not a big fan of it, but I didn't mind it in this soup because it was made so well and not overpowering. We also got tuna tartare which was some really good raw tuna but served with quite a generous amount of wasabi. If you like the taste and burn, this was an amazing dish, but probably a little overpowering for those who are more sensitive to a wasabi punch to your sinuses. \n\nOur entrees were the kurobuta pork chop and a grilled swordfish with mussles. They do cook their pork only medium well so that it is a little pink in the middle, but they really know what they are doing because it was one of the best pork chops I've ever had. Great flavors, not dry at all, yet cooked to a melt in your mouth texture that you don't often find with pork. The swordfish was hands down the best swordfish steak I've had in my life - it was super tender and moist and I would definitely order it again. Ugh that piece has put all other fish to shame, I've never even had one that good in Mexico or Hawaii. \n\nIf any review I've done on here deserves a 5 star rating, it is this one.

The salmon was so well cooked, and with the hint of sake in the broth, it was a WINNER. On the other hand, the wasabi flavor in the wasabi noodles wasn't too over-powering, even my friend who doesn't like wasabi at all was a big fan! That sure says a lot! \n\nFor dessert, we ordered the persimmon bread pudding and the coconut flan, and WOW, I never had such AMAZING asian-infused dessert. We actually had doubts when we ordered both the desserts, thinking that a persimmon bread pudding may taste weird, or the coconut flan may be too sweet, but we were pleasantly surprised!

We were a bit earlier than our reservation time but got seated in less than 10 minutes.  Our waitress was really nice and attentive.  She introduced the daily specials but didn't sound pushy at all.\n\nWe ended up getting the soup of the day (some mushroom soup with truffle oil?), tuna tartare with nori crisps, the kurobuta pork chop with pomegranate sauce, Hawaiian swordfish and mussels in a curry broth, and coconut creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e with passionfruit sauce.  We also got two glasses of Riesling which was really good but ended up being a bit too fruity with my entree (since the pomegranate sauce was already pretty fruity). \n\nThe soup was really tasty!  It had the perfect velvety texture, smelled amazing, and I'm glad the truffle oil/essence didn't overpower the whole dish.  We only ordered one because I only wanted to try a little bit and because it was the last bowl left. \n\nUnfortunately, I didn't like the tuna tartare appetizer too much.  I was expecting it to be more similar to a poke salad but it was dressed in a wasabi sauce and my tastebuds are really sensitive to wasabi.  It made me tear up and definitely cleared my nose.  But of course, that's not their fault - I'm just weak sauce :( I did enjoy the nori crisp though!\n\nFor my entree, I chose the kurobuta porkchop.  The waitress did warn me that here at The House, they cook the pork chop medium well.  I'm usually pretty squirmish with eating pink pork but I'm sure this establishment knows what they're doing in terms of cooking meat at the correct internal temperatures so I wasn't afraid.  This turned out to be a fantastic entree choice!  The pork was so tender and the sauce paired perfectly!  There is some fat on it so for those who don't like fatty meats, you have been warned.  But, I happen to love some fat on my meat so this was perfect!  I would definitely order this again in the future!\n\nMy boyfriend got the Hawaiian swordfish and mussels in curry broth.  I tried some of it and man, it's got to be one of the best pieces of cooked fish I've ever had!  The texture was perfect and the curry broth/sauce was creamy and matched well with the delicate fish.  But I do think that the fish was a bit under seasoned.  Other than that, delicious!\n\nWe ended our meal with the coconut creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e with passion fruit sauce.  I was not expecting the passionfruit sauce to be so tart but I like tartness in my dessert so this was good!!  The creme custard part put me to heaven!  Didn't detect any coconut taste/smell though.\n\nAll in all, a fabulous place for a date with your significant other or a small group dinner.  It is a small restaurant so expect to make reservations!  Parking is also a bit difficult so account for that as well!", "author": "Maggi K."}

First off, there is a time and place for pretentious, but I don't think Asian cuisine is particularly suitable to be such. I was extremely pleased by the House's down-to-earth dank food that was served up without obsession over how it was plated. Please don't misinterpret my statement: the food looked appetizing, just not immaculate, which to me is a more authentic representation of what Asian cuisine embodies. My mom always told me that a lot of Asian food doesn't look as great as it tastes. \n\nThe restaurant itself is quite small so you should expect to be sitting about a feet away from the next table. Service was fair; though when I first arrived at the restaurant and announced I had a reservation, the waitress looked at me with a blank stare for what seemed like 10 minutes before saying she'd be with me in a second. I'm almost positive I spoke English.   \n\nI adored all the dishes we ordered:\n+Manila Clams in a chili broth (on the specials menu)\n+Deep-Fried Salmon Roll with hot mustard\n+Grilled Sea Bass with garlic ginger soy\n+Swordfish with a coconut curry base (on the specials menu)\n\nThe chili broth for the clams was just the right amount of spicy and my friend and I loved it so much we asked for extra bread to soak up every last drop. The sea bass was cooked to perfection - flaky and not gelatinous.", "author": "Charlotte Z."}

The price is actually really reasonable for the quality and portions of the food. If you love Asian Fusion, it will be hard not to love The House.\n\nMake a reservation well in advance if possible because there is very little room for seating inside (also not recommended for big parties). I came on a date with my boyfriend and we had a fantastic time. \n\nService was very quick and pleasant and the food was just amazing. We had:\n\n1) Soft Sell Crab - So delicious with the sauce! Tender and decent amounts of crab \n2) Salmon Roll - Great to try (lots of salmon) but not super unique since it just tasted like any baked roll you might find at a sushi place \n3) Sea Bass w/garlic noodles - Oh my GOSH I still think about this sea bass. So soft, perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned. The garlic noodles were also such a good compliment! I liked them way better than the wasabi noodles. Would get again (and again and again)\n4) Steak with wasabi noodles - Huge portion for the price, great steak, but the wasabi noodles just could not compare to the garlic noodles...\n\nHighly recommended for date night!

We had early reservations during a weeknight and the place was almost full.  Service was attentive from the three staff members who tended to us. The food was delicious!\n\nPicked cucumbers (complimentary) - Thinly sliced, crunchy and spicy bites to whet your appetite for what was to come!\n\nGrilled octopus - The most tender pieces of octopus I've tasted with just the right amount of flavor.  It has a nice mild spiciness to the grilled pieces which were sliced thin to make me feel like I was eating a soft fish rather than octopus.  I want some more!\n\nRibeye steak with mashed potatoes and cauliflower - Nicely prepared rare steak with tasty garlic pieces which was tender and flavorful.  This was a generous portion so you could keep enjoying each flavorful bite until you had your fill but you really need to eat the yummy cauliflower that was hidden underneath the steak soaking up all the juices!  The best cauliflower I've ever eaten!\n\nMiso Black cod w/tender greens topped w/crab avocado maki (daily special) - We had the servers repeat the dish to us twice because the black cod was so buttery and smooth that I thought they gave me the sea bass instead but I knew the sea bass was presented differently.  This dish was the winner of the evening!  The crab avocado maki was sliced lengthwise like an open faced sandwich.  The roll was very fresh but after taking a bite and sharing some, I didn't get to eat the rest of it because someone else begged to eat it all.\n\nAtmosphere - Small, cozy, wood themed restaurant that can get loud.\n\nParking is not the best in the neighborhood so be prepared to circle around if you want to park on the street.  Another option would be to park at the Vallejo St. Parking garage right next to the police station.  It's only a couple of blocks walk to the restaurant if you don't mind paying for parking.

It was nice how they let us make a lunch reservation and change it to a later time because we were running late. \n\nAnyways.. to the food!\n\nFried Salmon Roll with Chinese Mustard... that mustard really compliments the salmon roll! I saved some for our later dishes because I liked it so much. \n\nWarm Wasabi House Noodles with Grilled Pork! The pork honestly wasn't my favorite but the wasabi noodles were... as some would say, ON FLEEK! So delicious and honestly I don't think I've ever had anything like that before. \n\nCurry Noodles with Grilled Chicken... absolutely excellent.  Very generous portion too! \n\nRib eye steak special: I think our eyes lit up when our server told us this was one of the specials and again, we devoured this delicious dish.\n\nUsually we skip dessert, but we heard coconut creme brulee and apple pie a la mode and... well.. I would definitely recommend both! \n\nService here was great too! Parking obviously sucks but its SF what can you do?

This is probably their most popular appetizer\n\nGrilled Scallops with ponzu sauce ($15/4 stars) - One of their appetizer specials! 3 decently sized scallops with lots of saucy goodness. Not sure what it was but it was good!! We liked this over the salmon. \n\nWasabi Noodles with Flat Iron Steak ($20/3 stars) - Hmm. Everyone rants about the noodles.

He has such high expectations for food that I know I will not be disappointed by his choice. We made reservations a week in advance for 7.30pm and *WARNING: We took 30 minutes to find parking. Do allocated some time for parking in this very popular area of SF.*\n\nWe were seated 15 mins after our reservation. The place is rather normal looking, no cute or fancy decorations to steer you away from the real star - the food. While I was waiting, I was attracted to the large portions of wasabi noodles ($19) because I was so hungry! I decided to order that. There was also a special menu for that night where the main course was short ribs with mashed potatoes and cauliflower ($28).  My bf decided to give that a try. \n\nWasabi noodles with beef: Upon first bite, the wasabi flavor spread throughout my mouth. It was not overpowering at all, in fact, it was amazing and I loved how it combined so well with the udon. I immediately made a mental note to try putting wasabi in noodles the next time I cook. I do have to complain about the beef. I got it medium rare, and the beef was medium-medium done at best. I went with it because having the order changed and complaining just takes up so much time and I would rather enjoy my meal. I do wish that the wasabi came in more punctuated flavors throughout the course of the meal, rather than the initial oomph. I could barely taste the wasabi after the first few bites. \n\nShort ribs: The beef here was 5x better than that of mine. It was soft, juicy, tender, with appropriate amounts of fats that agreed with my palate. I exchanged a few pieces of my meal with my bf's! The mashed potatoes were super special as well, as it was mashed with carrots. There wasn't much seasoning to the mashed potatoes but I guess the star to focus on were the ribs. \n\nAfter these two dishes, I was really full and gave the rest of my noodles to my bf who willingly finished it up. I wished I had their dessert as many tables around me had them!\nI am not a fan of the noise level but the food made up for it. I will definitely come here again :)", "author": "Jinyen Y."}

But then again, you probably like PF Chang's, so why should I bother...\n\n- DEEP-FRIED SALMON ROLL with Chinese hot mustard\n\nPretty fun, but it would have been much much much better if the salmon was raw rather than slightly cooked. Salmon is one of those fish genetically designed to be eaten raw. The roe was a nice touch, and the overall presentation and texture was pleasing.\n\n***WARM WASABI HOUSE NOODLES with angus flatiron steak\n\nMild wasabi flavor, the noodles were okay, but nothing noteworthy. The steak tasted fresh, but we asked for medium rare and it was closer to well-done. I like a little moo with my cow. Side veggies nice but unmemorable.\n\n***GRILLED SEA BASS with garlic ginger soy\n\nSeared well, the wife liked the consistency (I thought it was slightly tough), but we both felt that it was flavorless. Then they gave us this dipping sauce that was overwhelmingly sweet and inferior to my homemade dumpling dipping sauce (and I'm caucasian, so boom-shakalaka!). Two-buck Chinese restaurant takeaway order side greens.\n\n***BITTERSWEET CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE CAKE--coffee ice cream, coconut caramel\n\nThis was quite good even though I was expecting to not like it. The chocolate wasn't too strong, although in my mind something like this that tends to be rich should always be balanced by something fruity.\n\n***COCONUT CREME BRULEE, passionfruit puree\n\nThere seemed to be no coconut in this at all. Okay creme brulee. Literally less than a teaspoon of passionfruit puree, which was a major no no.\n\nALL IN ALL:\n\nNot a bad meal, but considering the reviews & price, it tasted like a slightly upgraded version of PF Chang's.

First thing that came to mind before dining here last Saturday night was \"overrated\". I thought no way it would be THAT good. Well, I was wrong and it turned out being The House (of Goodness)!\n\nThe House is a really tiny so reservations are HIGHLY recommended if you plan on dining here. Don't ask me how many tables they have because I was slightly intoxicated when I showed up around 7:30pm. \n\nCaesar Salad with Crispy Scallops ~ 4.5 stars ~ $9.00: I have a little secret... I've never been a big fan of scallops. However, now that I've tried this dish at The House, I'm a believer. The scallops were seared perfectly on the outside to lock-in all the flavor of the tender interior. The sauce was delicious and the greens they put on top of each one gives it some freshness. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=sAugkzJG8H09XwEvSZE-Kg&userid=CZ36wJqV-Xit758UaOr81A\n\nMaine Crab Cake with Pickled Ginger Remoulade ~ 5 stars ~ $11.00: WOW! This pear-shaped crab cake was SO RAD - perfect for sharing. The crab was absolutely the star in this dish, which isn't always the case at other places. The crunchy exterior was the perfect compliment to the moist and intense flavor. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=wX4ZSuqYidNqDIYkqXqiAA&userid=CZ36wJqV-Xit758UaOr81A\n\nKurobuta Pork Chop with Pomegranate Currant Sauce ~ 3 stars ~ $24.00: This was one of the few strike outs of the night for The House. I was so underwhelmed by this dish. The main reason is because the pomegranate sauce was way too sweet. Not only that, I didn't think the pork chop and sauce paired well with each other at all. The chop was also a tad dry - GASP! http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=fUJBgGs9qP9gvMTWopcH9A&userid=CZ36wJqV-Xit758UaOr81A\n\nWarm Wasabi House Noodles with Angus Flatiron Steak ~ 4 stars ~ $18.00: Was this dish worth 18 bucks? No, and that's why I knocked down one star. However, it was really good. The noodles were the star and the steak was just playing second fiddle. If they remove the steak and knocked down the price, this would have been a hit. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the wasabi sauce was absolutely amazing. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=YdoaEwoamZE1hYwqE7Ah8Q&userid=CZ36wJqV-Xit758UaOr81A\n\nGrilled Sea Bass with Garlic Ginger Soy ~ 5 stars ~ $26.00: I'm SO pissed I didn't take a picture of this. It was by far and away our favorite dish of the night. The sea bass was buttery, flaky, moist and just outstanding. The saltiness of the garlic ginger soy took the awesome cut of fish to another level. I HIGHLY recommend this dish. Do not leave this place without trying their sea bass. \n\nI went with my buddy Josh, my brother and my sister-in-law. We also ordered two large bottles of nigori which led me to get way too tipsy to remember the three other dishes we ordered. I vaguely remember us ordering another fish dish, steak and another app, but I don't want mention them since my memory is absolutely failing me right now. My brother and sister-in-law were in town for her birthday so I paid for dinner. The total bill came out to be around $250 pre-tax which I didn't think was that bad at all considering how much we ordered plus the two bottles of sake. The service was outstanding and the atmosphere was very welcoming. \n\nThe only reason I'm not giving this place five stars is because there were a couple of items I didn't care for at all, especially the pork chop. However, everything else we ordered was BOMB DOT COM. I wouldn't hesitate to go back.

Neener neener neener!\n\nYes Yelpers, be jealous...be very jealous as I was in the company of both John Z and Markus N two of the most desired males on the internet.\n\nWe stopped in on a Friday evening, John Z had secured an 8:00 reservation which is prime dinner time. As we approached the entry we noticed several diners waiting for tables. My first thought was that would be no way we would be seated on time. No big deal as we were no rush, but to my (most pleasant surprise) our wait is no more than 5 minutes and were seated at a nice table in the center of the dining room.\n\nLet me get the bad stuff out of way. What did I not like about The House?\n\nNothing.\n\nOk, now on to the good stuff.\n\nThe food. Awesome.\n\nHere are the details.\n\nWe started off by sharing the string bean appetizer. They were lightly breaded and served with a delicious dipping sauce. We each had a glass of sauvignon blanc, which priced at just $8.00 a glass was the perfect pairing.\n\nWe then shared a salad that was lightly (and perfectly dressed) and accompanied with deep fried chicken livers. Again, delicious.\n\nNext up, the cod. I really can't comment too much on this as I just don't do the seafood thing but my friends commented on loving it, which is good enough for me.\n\nWhat's next? How about the pork chop. YES! Scored a big 5 stars all around the table. It was served with mashed potatoes (perfectly mashed by the way) and asparagus. It was perfectly cooked to medium and was mouth watering. This dish belongs on any pork chop lovers radar.\n\nFinally the flatiron steak, served over noodles this dish did not disappoint. Again, perfectly cooked to medium rare. The steak and noodles were the perfect combination. \n\nOur wine for the evening was a bottle of Carignan from Mendocino County. A medium (to almost full bodied wine) that I thought for the $45 dollar price was an absolute bargain.\n\nThe House is one of those places that I completely fell in love with. Not expensive, service excellent and food that is out of this world. I cannot wait to get back here again.", "author": "Rene C."}

The staff is very polite, and was very patient with everyone despite all the chaos happening in such a small restaurant. \n\nWe ordered a couple things:\n\nFor starters, we ordered the MAINE CRAB CAKE with a pickled ginger remoulade, which was absolutely delicious. It's a great starter because it's light and fluffy, with a generous amount of crab meat in it as well. \n\nFor our entrees, we had the...\n-Warm Wasabi House Noodles with Angus Flatiron Steak: the Angus steak was very well seasoned, & cooked to a perfect medium rare.  It's sliced up already, so if you prefer a whole piece of meat, don't hesitate to order the rib-eye steak instead (just as delicious). The steak was placed on top a bed of sweet & savory wasabi noodles, which packed a nice punch, and was a nice balance to the flavors of the meat. \n\n-Grilled Seabass with Garlic Ginger Soy- Honestly the best piece of fish I have ever had.

It was actually pretty tasty, considering how i was a little hesitant on ordering it.

My steak was HUGE! it took over the whole plate and sat on a bed of mashed potatoes and broccolini. My steak was cooked to my perfection! I ordered it medium rare. It was well seasoned with soy sauce and fried garlic. I couldn't finished the whole thing, so I took it home and ate it the next day and it was just as good.\n\nMy bf's chilean sea bass was another story.. he didn't like it very much and said it was too salty.

My boyfriend made reservations about a week and a half in advance and the only opening left on a Friday night was 5:30pm. The restaurant is pretty small and is located near SF Chinatown. Because of how packed the small restaurant is, you're only abut a foot away from the next table which gets pretty cramped. We tried the following dishes:\n\nDeep Fried Salmon Roll - This appetizer was pretty unique. But, I was a little disappointed that the sauce that came with it was a little watered down and the salmon inside was a little overcooked. My boyfriend had tried this dish before and said it was better the last time he was there. I thought this dish was good but could've been better. \n\nWasabi Noodles with Salmon (substituted Salmon instead of the Flatiron Steak) - The staff was pretty accommodating about letting us substitute the dishes with any type of protein we wanted. After hearing all the great reviews about their wasabi noodles, I was hoping that they would be more flavorful. Again, my boyfriend said that they were better the last time he was there. I was surprised by how generous their salmon portion was. I thought the dish was good but I wasn't amazed. \n\nPork Chop - ORDER THIS DISH! This dish was why I thought this restaurant deserves 5 stars. I normally am not a huge fan of pork chop but once I saw that it came with a pomegranate sauce, I was sold (I love pomegranates)! I loved loved loved this dish! I swapped this dish with my boyfriend's for him to try and immediately wanted it back. The pork chop was perfectly seasoned and really tender. It's great on its own but even better swirled with some of their pomegranate sauce. Sad part was that I thought their mashed potatoes were a little bland and just tasted like potatoes with no seasoning. \n\nThe House is a great place for a quick meal. You probably won't stay for long considering how cramped it is inside. Their food is a great twist on Asian Fusion.

My girlfriend made a reservation weeks in advance and we arrived at the location on time.  We walked in with a smile, expecting to be greeted in a similar manner.  The female asian hostess walked towards us giving us a quick glance over in a mundane manner and greet a lady who walked in behind us like she was her long lost friend.  I am a firm believer in customer service so i tried not to let that bother me.  After her reunion with her friend she looked at us with the same mundane look and directed us to our table.  So i also have to mention how small and tight the restaurant.  As we ordered our food the restaurant started to fill up.  The waiter i mentioned before continued to bump into me as he was attending to the table next to ours.  Not even a sorry or excuse me after about 7 consecutive bumps.

My boyfriend and I had been meaning to try The House for a while. I managed to call and make a reservation for a Saturday night. Due to work related things and traffic, we ended up not making our reservation time. I called ahead and told them I wasn't going to make it, and they said they would see what they could do for me. When I arrived, they still seated me right away even though I was half an hour late and there was another party ahead of me in line. Hooray!  \n\nNow onto the food. I tried the fried calamari. Perhaps I should've been more adventurous, but I love calamari. It was possibly the best fried calamari I've ever had. I also had the wasabi noodles and the pork chop. The wasabi noodles were tasty, but the the pork chop was downright magical. It was cooked to perfection. I've never had such a well executed piece of pork in my life. Every part of it was tender and juicy. The House really does bring pork to a whole new level. To this day, that pork chop is still the epitome of everything a pork chop should be. Ok, I'll stop raving now.  For dessert, we had the panna cotta. It was good enough that I spent several minutes scraping the sides of the empty bowl in the hopes of getting enough for one more taste.

Reservations are highly recommended, and try your very best not to be late because they will give away your table. I mean, I can see why, this place is super tiny.\n\nFrom my recent visits, I've tried:\nCaesar salad with crispy scallops- This was great to share, very fresh and light.\n\nScallops a la carte (this was from the specials menu)- So good! The scallops were perfectly seared and the sauce was amazing.\n\nKale and pistachio salad (also from the specials menu)-  This was absolutely delicious! The kale are shredded into thin slices and seasoned with just the right amount of dressing and topped with pistachio. The flavors and textures of this dish went together so well. Two thumbs up!\n\nKurobuta pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce- The presentation for this dish was on point. I loved the color of the pomegranate sauce and it created a nice balance for the pork chop. The flavor was aromatic and tasty.\n\nSesame soy glazed salmon- This was probably the most Asian-looking dish. It was good to try but not something I'd order again. \n\nGrilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy- This is a must try! The fish literally just melts in your mouth, and I didn't even know fish could do that! It has this nice, buttery texture that's so easy to eat and before you realize it, you've already eaten the entire dish. If you order this (which you should), do not order any other type of fish for the table (which we did) because this dish would make you not want to eat anything else.\n\nOh, and I also ordered the lychee iced tea.

It makes me sad to say that I no longer have a favorite restaurant in SF due to my recent dining experience here. My usual, the sea bass, didn't melt in my mouth like it did the previous times--it tasted like sea bass I can buy and cook at home. The accompaniments also left a lot to be desired--the green beans were so skinny and the noodles tasted a bit soggy. My husband ordered the ribeye, which was mostly fat and lacking flavor. The worst was my mom's wasabi noodles and skirt steak. Why would they give us a knife if the steak is so tough that you can't even cut through it? I thought my mom was being picky, so we all tried to cut the steak, which was nearly impossible. Eating it was even more impossible. I couldn't even chew through it, so I swallowed it. When we asked our server, she said it was supposed to be like that since it's a lean cut of meat. I don't know anyone who would pay $22 to eat that--I wouldn't even accept $22 to eat it. The wasabi noodles were also very greasy. Needless to say, most of that dish was left untouched. I was so sad that this was the last meal on my mom's visit here and she even picked up the tab. Imagine spending a hefty amount on a sucky meal--definitely not a good way to go out. \n\nI recommended this place to so many visitors, raving about how great it was.

Tuna tartare had a bit too much wasabi for my liking (I strongly dislike wasabi). Calamari was good, nothing special. The salmon roll was also good.

We fell out of the cab and immediately realized there was a little crowd outside.  We walked in, fully expecting to still have to wait in spite of having reservations.  However, they were immediately ready for us and seated us right away.\n\nIt became very apparent very quickly that the place is tiny and every single bit of space is maximized, probably not to the best of ways.  We felt like giants in the little area we were given.  Between dad and I, we felt like linebackers trying to squeeze in around a small kid's tea party.  However, after we took off our coats, it felt a little less constrictive in there.\n\nThe food was fantastic.  The plating was beautiful and after mom's 3 months stay here in the U.S., she says this place was her favorite above all the other places we'd taken her to.\n\nWe ended up sharing everything.  I don't remember exact descriptions but mom got a scallop dish with wasabi noodles, dad and I got a steak dish (rib-eyes I believe) and aunt got a fish dish.  \n\nService was polite and nice but understandably, they didn't have time to stand around and chat with us.

The meats were cooked to order (we asked for medium) and they were perfection - tender, juicy, and full of flavor.  The short ribs and ribeye came with mashed potatoes, which were ok, but I guess they were toned down to allow the meat to be the star.  The wasabi noodles were wonderful too, but they are on the spicy side.  Don't order those unless you like spicy stuff!    \n\nFor dessert, we shared several.  We tried the apple cobbler (?), which was fine, but it didn't stand out.  The bittersweet chocolate dessert with coffee ice cream was our clear favorite.

I was immediately awed by the generous cut served. As I cut in to the perfectly cooked pork, I became an instant fan. The sweet and slightly tart sauce complemented the pork so well, cutting the fattiness of the meat. If I could bottle that sauce, I would serve it on practically anything.

Remember to make a reservation a few days prior because the restaurant is pretty small. I had to change my reservation from 8 to 8:30 the night of and the staff was gracious despite how busy it was so that was nice. When we arrived, we were seated right away. The place is loud and the seats are soclose to each other you can pretty much join your neighbors' conversations but regardless, the food was A+MAZING.\n\nPer recommendation (and Yelp reviews), we started with salmon rolls, which were deep fried to perfection and came with this wasabi mustard sauce that had a unique kick to it. For entrees, I ordered the sea bass and my BF ordered the pork chop. Let's start with mine. I had to refrain myself from swallowing my sea bass whole just because it was so freaking delicious. The fish melted in your mouth and the garlic ginger sauce it came with was magical (confession: we dipped everything we could into it). I was pleasantly surprised by the pork chop because I was a bit hesitant about the pomegranate sauce but everything came together perfectly. The sauce wasn't too sweet and the pork chop via the words of my BF was \"the best pork chop he's ever had.\" He was literally crying tears of joy with every bite. For dessert, we went with the coconut creme brulee. Again, a little unsure about it at first but man, were we wrong (again). Personally not a big fan of the passionfruit puree on top but the creme brulee itself was everything a dessert freak like me could've ever dreamed of. \n\nOverall, I've never eaten a meal so slowly just because I wanted to try and savor every bite. The House was everything I've hoped for and more on this trip to SF from LA and you know 110% I'll be coming back whenever I'm in the Bay Area. Hands down, the best $90 ever spent.

We tried the Warm Wasabi House Noodles with Angus Flatiron Steak and the Miso Black Cod w/ an Avocado roll special. For both entr\u00e9es, the presentation and combination of ingredients was so impressive and unique because you wouldn't expect it to work. I have to mention that the quality of the cod in specific was extremely fresh and tasty. I usually dislike eating the skin on fish, but the skin on this cod tasted amazing as well. \n\nLike others mentioned, the restaurant is small so I wouldn't risk not calling in for reservations ahead of time. I was able to get reservations on the same day for two. The only con about The House is parking. Parking is pretty difficult since they don't have valet or private parking. You have to pretty much either drive in circles for 20 minutes to find street parking or pay $10-20 at private parking lot that's within walking distance. Aside from this challenge, I would definitely recommend The House if you're ever in North Beach.", "author": "Caitlin M."}

Everytime I think about The House, I think about the delicious food (esp the seabass!) I had that night. I had made reservations one week in advance on a Monday night. We easily found street parking about two blocks away so I think we got really lucky that night. Plus, it was free after 6pm. :) When we arrived, we were seated immediately. The House is pretty small on the inside, so it's best not to come here in a big group. I actually think The House would be perfect for a date night! Anyways, we shared the following: \n\nClassic Fried Calamari - Started with the calamari as an appetizer. The calamari was not too heavy and it tasted pretty good. Nothing too special about it. \n\nWarm Wasabi House Noodles with Angus Flatiron Steak - I thought this dish was just alright.. I felt that I have had way better flatiron steak elsewhere and I did not really taste the wasabi in the noodles. I was pretty disappointed. :(\n\nBlack Cod with California Roll - Second best dish after the grilled seabass! This was one of the specials that was not listed on their menu. The black cod was soft and moist. It was pretty flavorful; however, I definitely liked the flavor in the seabass more than the black cod. I thought it was pretty interesting that it came with the California Roll. California Roll was just any other California Roll except bigger. \n\nGrilled Seabass with Garlic Ginger Soy - AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!!!! We had ordered the seabass with mashed potatoes. The seabass was grilled perfectly. It was so soft, moist, and buttery. Each bite melted in my mouth. This dish was definitely my favorite of the night. Everything about this dish was just perfect!\n\nChocolate Truffle Cake with Coffee Ice Cream - YUMMY! Perfect way to end the meal. The dessert was chocolately and rich. It was not too sweet. The coffee ice cream complemented the truffle cake just perfectly!\n\nOverall, service was good that night and I had a really delicious and tasty dinner. Thus, the reason why I gave them five stars. I would definitely recommend The House to others. :)", "author": "Philana C."}

I'm glad we decided to wait, because the food was to die for.  We had four dishes in total.  \n\nCaesar Sald with Crispy Scallops:  A\nTheir caesar dressing is really something else.  It has a nice tart flavor to it, and isn't too creamy.  The scallops are fried, and were a nice golden brown served right out of the frier.  They just melted in your mouth with a rich seafood flavor.\n\nDeep-fried chicken liver with baby greens:  A\nI thought the crispy scallop salad was good, but this was another level.  The chicken liver was fried as well, and had the perfect consistency and richness with every bite.  It was tossed in a vinagrette dressing that really let the creaminess of the chicken liver shine.\n\nWarm wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak:  A\nCooked to a perfect medium rare, the flatiron had the perfect texture.  Flatiron is not known to be a soft cut of beef, but is instead known for its very beefy flavor.  Even though it was a little rough, it exceeded my expectations for a flatiron.  The wasabi noodles were simply delicious.  They were udon style and pan fried with a wasabi sauce.\n\nGrilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy:  A+\nThe sea bass was grilled and was also served over a bed of noodles in a sweet soy sauce.  The sea bass was cooked perfectly, and juices melted out of it when I first cut it.  It was right at the point where it was almost rare, so it was not dry at all.  I was very impressed that it wasn't mushy, but actually had some give to the texture.\n\nOverall, a great place.  I can see why this place was so full even on a weeknight.  Please come try this place!  I will continue recommending it to my friends.  They don't have to many covers, so be sure to make reservations.\n\nPROTIP:  They have a great wine list that can easily be paired with many menu items.", "author": "David C."}

The lady who seated us was a little unfriendly but our waitress was terrific!  \n\nWe sat down and looked over the menu and everything sounded fabulous but we settled on:\n\n-Softshell crab tempura:  This was one of the special starters not on the regular menu. It was served with some  sweet chili noodles that had a bit of kick to it. The softshell crab was not overfried, it was perfect.\n\n-Seared scallops with some citrus ponzu sauce:  Another special starter not on the menu. Seared just the way I like it!

The salmon was a bit overcooked- it wasn't dry, but it was very firm and heading there. The daikon was just hard and chewy, but at least the broth was good. \n\nMy friend had the sea bass and it was overcooked. It was dry, but the sauce was a nice complement to the sea bass.\n\nMy other friend had the roasted chicken, which she liked until she got to the wing/drumstick portion and found pink pieces and stopped eating it.\n\nAll in all, we left silently and didn't ask how we liked the meal and instead, trekked to find ice cream, hoping it would save us.", "author": "Emily C."}

I was surprised that the seabass had a strong fishy taste but the sauce was really good so when I ate it together it overpowered the fishiness. \nThis place was good but not great and I didn't really care for the ambiance. The waitress had no humor.  She was very informative but not memorable. She didn't even ask us for our beverage. As we walked in we didn't feel welcome.  t think for price and location. They definitely need a waitress with an outgoing personality and if the ambiance isn't great atleast the food should exceed our expectations which it didn't.

Despite its popularity, we were able to easily get a lunch reservation for 4 on a Saturday at 12:30. Parking in the area is extremely difficult to find, so I'd recommend planning to arrive a good 20-30 minutes before your reservation.\n\nAPPETIZERS\n- Deep-fried Salmon Roll: As one of the most popular starters here, this one did not disappoint. Warning: The wasabi dipping sauce is really spicy, so dip at your own risk!\n- Ahi Tuna: This was one of their specials and not on the menu. The portion size was kind of small, and it was probably more aesthetically than gustatorily pleasing, but delightful nonetheless.\n\nMAIN ENTREES\n- Wasabi Noodles: This one didn't contain as much wasabi flavor as I envisioned, which is a good thing. It's actually so discreet that even a child could enjoy. I'd recommend this dish because it's not only delicious but also very unique.\n- Curry Noodles: Though not as popular as its wasabi counterpart, I think the curry noodles are slightly better. Plus it comes with corn!\n- Swordfish in coconut milk curry sauce: This was also one of their specials not on the menu. I think the presentation of this dish also wows more than the taste. Overall it was still a great dish, but it doesn't live up to the others.\n- Grilled Sea Bass: The hype for this dish is right-on. This entree looks the plainest, but it's definitely the stand-out one in terms of flavor. Maybe I'm biased because sea bass is my absolute favorite type of fish, but this was so good that it might even be a candidate for my last meal on Earth. :)\n\nI will have to make one complaint, although it's not big enough of a deal to take a star away from my rating. For a restaurant with a continuous flow of customers coming in and out, a lot of their ceramic plates are chipped and extremely dirty (with grey/black marks from excessive use over the years). They're noticeably dirty enough for my friends and I to all look at one another with raised eyebrows as the waiter set them down in front of us.\n\nRegardless, I'm very pleased with my experience at The House. Since I found both of the special non-menu items that we ordered to be subpar to the others, my recommendation would be to stick to the regular menu items and to TRY THE GRILLED SEA BASS!", "author": "Celia K."}

My bad.\n\nWe came early hoping to sit at the bar, but there was no bar. The waiter/host looks overwhelmed. I get the feeling he was used to dealing with assholes because he was preemptively asshole-y to start. The place is TEENY-TINY. Like the size of a studio apartment so prepare yourself for that claustrophobia. Also, because it's so tiny, anytime someone walks in to their non-existent entrance, the entire place gets the night cold air thrown in their face. It sounds like I'm complaining, right? Ugh, I want to but the food is so good, I cannot decrease their rating.\n\nThere was a couple that's been waiting for 2.5 hours because she was dumb and didn't make reservations - and stayed for the 2.5 hours!

The portions are huge. If you are hungry, don't over-order *ahem* and barf afterwards. Calm the eff down and take it slow. All portions are meant to be shared.

Knowing that this place is pretty tight and pretty popular, I made sure to book a reservation at least a week in advance. I initially planned for a party of 10 and they had no problems with that. My guest list shrunk down to 7 three days before my reservation and they had no problem with that. The day of the reservation, my cousin happened to make a surprise visit with his wife and kid but the restaurant was already packed so they squeezed in 3 extra chairs for a table that usually seats 6. They kind of gave me a frustrated look and I felt bad, but we were really tight sitting all together.\n\nAnyway, they were very accommodating and were very patient with me and my Asian family...with our Asian confusion when going to an unfamiliar restaurant and taking WAY too much time deciding what to eat. I ordered their famous Wasabi noodles and steak and really enjoyed the fusion flair. Their calamari was light and fluffy with a perfectly paired marinara. Steamed mussels were also so good that my uncle literally sipped all the juice from the dish!\n\nI brought a cake from Schubert's and they charged a $3 per person cutting fee. \n\nAll in all, I had a great experience.

The scallops were buttery and they were adorned with a lovely watercress.  The oysters were dressed to much as the oyster flavor got lost in a spicy sauce and cilantro.  The 3rd small plate was the grilled octopus.  I would order it again and again.  Perfectly cooked with a playful sriracha aoili.\nOur main courses were; wasabi noodles and flat iron steak, kobe beef with caramlized cauliflower, and lastly the sea bass with green beans and noodles.  The plating was less than imaginative but still welcoming.  The true test was in the first bite.

With that we were a party of 11 that took up a majority of the dining area. This modern Asian Fusion joint located in North Beach (maybe my fave 'hood) served it up though and for the most part I was extremely impressed (minus the wine).\n\nLets start off with the wine list, we ordered a few bottles and all just weren't that amazing. They were probably the cheaper ones but, still, have a few gems on the less expensive side. On to the food. The deep fried salmon roll with spicy mustard was super unique and very delicious however, one sliver was enough for me. I was a little underwhelmed by the homemade dumplings. They lacked any and all flavor. I'm a dumpling aficionado, trust me. \n\nAs entrees go, the sea bass I ordered with the garlic noodles was superb. Buttery, cripsy, perfect. The garlic noodles were ever so delicious. I'm glad it was a side rather than a main but, a perfect accompaniment. My friend Peter D's steak was a little on the meh side but with more house made teriyaki that meat was kicked up a notch.

I have gotten the sea bass and the pork chop on separate occasions and both are great but I do prefer the sea bass. The prices for the food you get is super reasonable but once you add on appetizers expect your bill to be about $50 a person if you're not a drinker as well.

I normally feel like they take normal Asian food, make it pretty and then charge 2x - 3x as much for it. But The House really took it away with the flavors, the execution and presentation.\n\nEverything we had was delicious.\nBlack Mussels with shrimp garlic broth. Not too heavy, I somewhat expected that because of how creamy and buttery the sauce tasted but the mussels were steamed perfectly and I thoroughly enjoyed the flavor. ($12)\n\nThe Sea Bass was flakey, perfectly tender and fresh. Coupled with a strong sauce that required only a little bit in order to taste all of the complexity. ($27)\n\nThe King Salmon was drenched in a delightful soy/miso sauce that was light and hearty. The fish, itself, was ridiculously perfect. Tender, fluffy and light. ($23)\n\nMushroom Rice. Tastes good but depended on the Bonito flakes to give the entire dish flavor. ($20)\n\nWasabi Noodles with Angus Flatiron Steak. The noodles were not what I was expecting, it tasted of boiled down wasabi paste tossed in with the noodles. For this sort of price, I expected fresh wasabi to be tossed, giving it the oomph it would need to cut through the oily noodles. However, the noodles were much too oily and not something I felt like making a meal of. The steak was chargrilled to perfection with the perfect type of warm red inside. Because of this, I would only suggest ordering a steak sans the noodles ($19)\n\nSo why am I giving The House 3-stars?\n\nMade reservations for 9PM. Waited in the doorway for 20 minutes while other people were seated. Why am I waiting for 20+ minutes if I have a reservation? That obviously meant nothing. Also, it's a super small place, standing anywhere means that you are a fire hazard. Seriously.\n\nPlace is so small that you should expect to be able to hear everyone else's conversation. You will not be able to get to the only available restroom without pretty much announcing to the 3 parties around you because they will need to move in order for you to get out.\n\nThough it's so small, we asked for a refill on water at least 3 times.\nThe waitstaff was a little impatient in our large party (5 people) ordering and annoyed that we opted out of the alcohol (it's not particularly the sort of atmosphere my group wanted to drink in. Not that we had space for the glasses or anything once the food was out.)\n\nFor the type of price you are commanding, I do expect a better ambiance. Better service and even better food. If this was a hole in the wall, charging a bit less and with the same sort of poo-poo service, I would give it 4-5 stars but as a high-end establishment this is nothing I would be raving about.", "author": "Win\u00e8 C."}

The spicy mustard dip was addictive. \n\nI had the sea bass which came with noodles and beans, and while the fish itself didn't have that much flavor (it was a good portion though, and very tender yet meaty, as it should be) the sauce it came with was DELICIOUS. I dipped everything on my plate in that, and when I finished my meal, my husband used it for his kobe steak. The noodles were also a bit bland; I preferred the mashed potatoes that came with my husband's steak (which was the special that night and had a mushroom sauce). \n\nWe had a bottle of sake and some beer along with dinner. The bottle of sake was bigger than I expected somehow and it was actually rather hard to finish. I wish we hadn't been so full that we couldn't handle dessert, but nothing on the dessert menu jumped out at me anyway...their dessert menu seemed pretty standard. Service was good.

The sauce was amazing though, and the pork chop was cooked to be quite tender.\nHalibut with truffle sauce (today's special): This was probably the only disappointing dish out of the three. It was a good portion size considering it was halibut, and the price was reasonable, but the truffle flavor wasn't very strong, nor did it seem to pair the fish well.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the bittersweet chocolate truffle cake.

The coffee ice cream lacked coffee flavor, unfortunately.\n\nAs a note, they don't do anything special for birthdays.

My boyfriend and I came here on a Saturday Night around 5:30 and thought we could get a table without making a reservation. Little did we know, this place was busy at that time. Luckily, they told us the wait would just be 30 mins. I didn't mind since it was a bit early. We had a hostess take down our name and phone number, and we walked around for 30 mins. 25 mins later we get a call to tell us our table is ready. \n\nOnce we got back, we were seated right away. The place was really busy so I expected really good things. We looked at our surroundings and the first thing we notice is the modern sleek decor with a slight Asian feel. The table decorations are cute. The place mat is punched out with a small house. I thought it was a nice touch. \n\nOnce we were handed our menus, our waitress asked us what we wanted to drink and told us their specials. She was very kind and patient with us, which I really appreciated. There were so many good looking items on the menu and it was hard for us to choose. In the end, we decided on: deep fried salmon roll, Maine Crab Cake, and the Teriyaki Rib Eye Steak. \n\nDeep Fried Salmon Roll: Presentation is spot on. Once you dig in, you realize that the salmon is slightly seared with the middle still a bit raw. I didn't mind it at all, It was actually very tasty and made the plate unique. The spicy wasabi dipping sauce was a perfect addition to the fried salmon roll. \n\nMaine Crab Cake: This crab cake is going to be nothing like anything you've ever tired and that makes it amazing. When it came out, it looks like a volcano with lava coming out. The crab cake itself was perfectly cooked. Crispy on the outside and crabby and soft on the inside. It's a flavor explosion in your mouth and whatever sauce is on the bottom of the crab cake added a great kick to this dish. I highly recommend this dish. My boyfriend hates seafood but he loved this dish.\n\nTeriyaki Rib Eye Steak: For our entree we decided on the rib eye to share. We have never had rib eye before so we didn't know what to expect. Our rib eye was cooked very well and tasted delightful. My only issue with this dish was that our rib eye had a couple pieces of fat on it. My boyfriend and I didn't know if this is how rib eye is supposed to taste but we were a bit annoyed with it. I couldn't eat a couple pieces because the meat was far to fatty and chewy. Otherwise, the non-fatty pieces were delicious. The thing that saved this dish for me was the vegetables that came with it. The rib eye comes on top of really yummy mashed potatoes and amazingly spiced cauliflower. \n\nI really enjoyed my service here. I've read a couple of the reviews and people ragged on their service. I was very happy with our service here. They were very quick, nice, and accommodating. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed my time at The House. Great atmosphere, great food presentation, good service, and great food.  I would love to come back here an try the wasabi noodles that everyone raves about.", "author": "Stacey L."}

I and my three other friends had an unforgettable dinner here. What can go wrong with inventive, delicious, and affordable food plus great service? Trust me! The House is undisputedly Asian Fusion at its best.\n\nWe were deeply grateful to my good friend from UCLA, Nguyen D. who recommended this gem in a hole. \n\nThere are a few things I want to share with you. First, make reservation in advance. Second, do not be late. The restaurant is small, cramped, about 40-guest seating, and there is always a list of walk-ins, so imagine if you are late, the walk-ins take your space and then you have to wait in line for the next available table. Last, street parking is horrible, but luckily my friend found a public parking near the intersection of Stockton St. and Jackson St . Hope it helps.\n\nThe good thing about going with a group of friends to a restaurant like The House is that you get to try a lot of dishes. Portion of each dish can be shared between three-four people. Four of us ordered three entr\u00e9es and three main courses. We left the restaurant feeling full but not to the point that our bellies would burst.\n\n \nOur choices of small plates:\n\n- Seared dayboat scallops with micro greens and ponzu sauce. The scallops were fresh and had a pretty caramelized color. The ponzu sauce was light and accompanied the scallops really well.  \n\n- Deep-fried salmon roll with Chinese hot mustard. The outside was crispy while the inside stayed moist and tender. The miso wasabi dipping sauce and the accompanied Asian slaw together made your taste buds feel clean and definitely less of the greasiness that the word \"deep-fried\" called upon.\n\n- Charred baby octopus salad, crispy pork skin, red vinaigrette. The salad was fresh, delicious, but the flaw of this dish was the pork skin. It was not crispy at all, and we could tell that the pork skin was old and it was re-fried.\n\nOur selections of main courses:\n\n- Warm wasabi house noodles with Angus flatiron steak. We ordered medium-rare steaks and it came perfectly cooked. The wasabi noodles were bomb. The dish was phenomenal.\n\n - Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy. The fish was tender and succulent. We had it with garlic noodles, however it was not as good as Thanh Long's garlic noodles. \n\n - Niman ranch pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce. Pork chop was cooked medium, so the meat stayed moist and juicy. The mash potato was smooth and flavorful. The pomegranate currant sauce created a tangy but perfectly balanced taste to the dish. I am not a big fan of pork, but this dish was heaven on a plate to me.\n\nWe skipped desserts since we had plan to have it somewhere else.\n\nService was friendly and efficient. Our water glass was always full. Food arrived quickly. Overall, we adore the beautiful and exquisite plating and believe that each dish represents a thoughtful and harmonious blend of East and West ingredients.", "author": "Chau V."}

If I didn't know it was lychee black tea, I probably would've thought it was regular tea. \n\nWe recently returned to The House and this time we tried their more famous dishes: the house wasabi noodles with steak and the sea bass. I had the steak and while I wasn't blown away, I really enjoyed the dish. The steak was perfectly cooked and the noodles are unique, though I didn't taste too much wasabi. As for the sea bass, I was blown away and that's because I don't like to eat fish. I'll eat sashimi but I usually stay away from steamed fish, baked fish, etc. I can't stand the fishy taste. Having said all that, I loved the sea bass. I liked it more than the steak and noodles! This is saying a lot coming from me. It was so buttery on the inside with the nice sear on the outside--and the sauce really pulled it all together. I'm going back again, so I can get the sea bass for myself haha. We also had the ahi tuna with nori chops for our appetizer. It was good, but too much wasabi taste for the boyfriend. You can really taste the nori in the chips, which is nice. This time I didn't order a drink and stuck with good ol' water. \n\nService is very attentive and nice here. I think they lost our reservations because after we were seated, the hostess came back to ask again. It made us feel kinda weird since we were already seated...I'm not complaining since we got seated, but I thought I'd mention it.", "author": "Doris K."}

SO happy that we trusted the Yelpers!\n\nWe called in for a reservation at about 5pm and got a 9pm table. Definitely seems like they fill up every night. \n\nWe arrived 5min early and were seated right away. Service was very friendly and our waitress had a long list of specials ready for us to hear upon arrival. We ordered 2 Tsingtao and mulled over the menu. \n\nWe ended up with 2 small plates (Salmon spring rolls, and Shrimp and chive dumplings) and 2 large plates (Seared ahi, and the wasabi noodles with flank steak). Everything was fantastic but the standouts were the salmon spring rolls - perfectly rare in the middle but super crispy on the outside and the hot Chinese mustard dip was the perfect balance. Husband said he could eat them all day long. The other stand out was the seared ahi, it was served with two delicious sauces and some white rice with crispy vegetables of some sort for texture. I did love the wasabi noodle flank steak dish as well (noodles had great chew and steak was perfect medium-rare). Could have used more wasabi flavour IMO. I would probably pass on the dumplings next time. \n\nEverything was so full of flavour and for two people who are generally turned off by the word \"fusion\", this was Asian fusion at it's finest. The prices were fair compared to most hot restaurants in SF -- around $10-15USD for small plates and $19-25 for large plates. Well worth it. \n\nOh we also got the Chinese almond cookies to go for $5, perfect ending to the meal.", "author": "Alison C."}

I strongly suggest making a reservation a few days in advance. I tried to make a same day reservation for a Saturday night and was told that the earliest dinner would be at 10pm (which led me to reschedule for the following weekend). \n\nParking in north beach is painful. One alternative is driving around for 20 mins hoping to \"get lucky\" or you can park in a garage in Chinatown. We parked in \"Portsmouth Square Garden\" on Clay. Was about a 0.3 mile or 7 min walk from the restaurant  , pleasant stroll through china town. \n\nAnywho, now for the food review. Ate the following items: \nDeep fried salmon roll with mustard sauce - kind of like an eggroll with salmon inside of if. Was delicious. Mustard sauce has a hint of wasabi in it. \n\nClams with bread (special) - came with a delicious dipping sauce , highly recommend this as an appetizer \n\nPorkchop - had pomegranate sauce. Was cooked medium as specified. Hefty serving for its price $24. Well worth it. \n\nBlack cod (special) - served with slice crab roll with rice. Also delicious. Fish was tender and buttery. Only minor complaint is that the piece of fish I received was rather small. Maybe it was because it wasn't the \"official\" special of the day ? (I asked the waitress if they had it even though it was not mentioned, and they gladly prepared it for me). \n\nSkirt steak(special) - super tender meat served with potato veggies and some type of sauce. Also very tasty \n\nAngus steak with garlic noodles - large serving of noodles with pieces of steak on it.  Also yummy but had a smaller proportion of meat compared to noodles\n\nCoconut creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e with passiofruit pur\u00e9e - this was only ok. The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was topped with the pur\u00e9e , however the pur\u00e9e tasted rather sour. The dessert tasted better without the pur\u00e9e.  I do not recommend this. \n\nService was attentive. Servers were quick to fill cups. Also , the food came out rather quickly. Entrees came out in literally 15 minutes. Very impressive. The restaurant itself is very tiny and the interior isn't anything special, food is great though. Dinner entrees don't break the bank either ranging from 18-33 per plate.

I've lived in North Beach my whole life and for the last 9 years, I've celebrated my birthday here year after year. \n\nIt's Angela's Mango Pudding. It's magical. Get it. Hands down absolute must. \n\nLarry does an amazing job with everything on the dinner and lunch menu. My favorites are the following:\n\nAppetizers-- Fried Salmon Rolls with Wasabi Dipping sauce and the tempura green beans. \n\nEntrees--  Pork Chop with Pomegranate reduction and mashed potatoes, Wasabi house noodles with flat iron steak (it's not spicy don't worry), and the Chilean Sea bass with ginger soy dipping sauce. FANTASTIC. But you cant really go wrong with anything on the menu. \n\nNOTE: Any special with Kobe beef will be life changing. Do it and come back for a regular dish another time. \n\nDesserts: Like i said, the mango pudding is the real winner. Angela is an amazing pastry chef though and I really enjoy her flourless chocolate cake and apple pie. \n\nAh, can't wait to go back again for more.", "author": "Marissa S."}

The presentation for the dishes is Chopped worthy and Iron Chef worthy, very clean and super pretty that it is worth taking pictures of. I had the curry noodles and it was AMAZING! The curry isn't super spicy. On a scale of 1-10, 1 meaning eh, 10 meaning HOLY gimme some milk, it fell to a 3/4 to me, someone who is sensitive to spicy foods. The portion was great. If you are a big eater, then this is the place to go. The dish wasn't over priced. I think I paid for 11/12 bucks for a food baby from this place. The service is fantastic. The waiters are patient, they don't rush you to order and they tell you the daily specials and are happy to answer any questions you have. I have never seen such nice and patient waiters before! \n\nThe only catch is that this cute little restaurant is hidden in that part of Chinatown that isn't kid friendly, like lingerie stores and such.

I mean sometimes you get lucky and they give you a table if you are just randomly in the neighborhood and wanted to try out their oh  so delicious food! (No guarantee though! Always make a reservation if you plan on coming here!)\n\nAppetizers:\nDeep fried salmon rolls-They are crisp and filled with yummy salmon, served with a mustard sauce. \n\nThe steamed mussels-I would recommend getting these! The house took my mussel virginity away!!! They make me fall in love with mussels! The broth is so good that I was sipping on it even after the mussels were all gone! \n\nCalamari-Personally I am an asian salt and pepper calamari kind of girl so these were okay! They batter them very nicely and they tasted really light.\n\nEntrees:\nSea bass: The house also took away my sea bass virginity and wow what a great place to lose it! They make suchhhh amazinggg sea bass! It literally melts in your mouth! Comes with green beans and garlic noodles that are made with udon so its nice and chewy with this amazing explosion of flavor of soy sauce and garlic! \n\nPork chop: I never knew a pork chop could taste this amazing even with the weird sounding pomegranate sauce! My BF ordered this and I couldn't help but pick at his food and steal a few bites! PLEASE don't under estimate the sound of this entree, the pomegranate sauce actually compliments the pork chop very nicely!\n\nFlank steak with wasabi noodles: I wish they served the garlic noodles instead with this dish because I am not a very big fan of wasabi but it is still very yummy. The steak is very tender and cooked and seasoned just right!\n\nI would really recommend coming here for a special occasion or no occasion at all!

Me and my girl checked this place out on our last night in San Fran and DEAR GOD am I happy for tipsy, late night yelp runs. Found this place on here so THANK YOU YELPERS. We got the Deep Fried Salmon Roll which was TOO DIE FOR. I literally find myself craving this at least once a day. I then got the Grilled Sea Bass which came with noodles which was awesome as well! The almost teriyaki sauce MADE the noodles. I tried heating up the sea bass for leftovers a day later and it wasn't as great though/ didn't have too much of a flattering texture so eat up there!!\n\nMy friend got the octopus which was VERY pleasing the eyes as the owner is a GENIUS and just as pleasing to the mouth. Small portion though!!\n\nWe both got the passion fruit cr\u00e8me Brule. which ... I don't have to say ANYTHING because that Goddess speaks for itself. We paired this with Tea which came in the pots with the small cups per San Francisco Ritual :) \n\nThe ONLY downfall was that since it is so claustrophobic/ a small space when you come in, if you don't fit the boho chic crowd you will get started down.

It took me 15 minutes driving in circles to find parking and was very close to just going to in n out. Would have been the worst mistake ever! We ordered 4 small panted to share between 5 of us. We got the green beans tempura - very flavorful dipping sauce. Ahi tartare - a Littleton mushy for my taste. Chicharrones salad -very light and delicious. Yellowtail sashimi - love the avocado addition to it.\n\nFor the main course I hit the seared ahi and it was cooked and flavored perfectly! The sauce wasn't too sweet that it would be overwhelming and it was served on a bed of rice and spinach, with taro bits on top. Yum!!! My coworkers got the steak and wasabi noodles which were pretty good, the sea bass and the porkchop. They all enjoyed their meals!\n\nDessert we got the chocolate cake and ice cream but I didn't enjoy the cake too much. I felt like it was a cross between fudge and something mushy.

It was my  first time, but perusing Yelp all day before going for dinner left my mouth in a perpetual mouthwatering state. And let me tell you, I was not at all disappointed! In fact, despite going in with high expectations, The House somehow managed to surpass them!\n\nWe had made reservations beforehand, and a member of my party had already arrived by the time I got there, so there was no wait. Our server rattled off not 1, not 2, not even 3, but FOUR small plate specials and another four entr\u00e9e specials. We felt a little overwhelmed with all of our choices! Between the three of us, we ordered:\n\nDeep fried salmon roll with Chinese hot mustard - I'm not sure how they cooked this, but it was a piece of raw salmon wrapped in a wonton skin and then deep fried only on the outside so that the center part of the salmon was still cooked. I think my piece was overcooked, so I didn't get a large piece of raw salmon on the inside that I was expecting. Still good though. The sauce tasted like wasabi, which I'm not a fan of, so I can't comment on that.\n\nSteamed mussels with garlic infused shrimp broth - There were probably 20 mussels or so steamed in this delicious broth that was slightly creamy and extremely garlic-y. In fact, it was so good that we asked for some bread to soak up the soup after we devoured the mussels!\n\nCharred baby octopus salad - this was my meh dish of the night, though I should tell you that I'm not a huge salad fan. There were a couple bites of crispy pork skin in there that I really liked, but otherwise I couldn't get into it. The other members of my party seemed to like it though.\n\nGrilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy - Our first entr\u00e9e! I had read so many reviews about this signature dish that I was determined to order it. It came with green beans and a choice of noodles or rice. We opted for the garlic noodles. The sea bass was very soft and chewy, and paired with the sweet sauce that it came with, it was delicious!! The noodles and green beans were very typically Chinese, so overall it was a great dish but not mind-blowingly good.\n\nGrilled black cod with 2 crab and avocado sushi rolls - OMG. This. This dish was the defining moment of the entire dinner. Unfortunately it is a special and not on their normal menu, but if it is available PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do yourself a favor and order it. You won't regret it, I promise! The sushi rolls were pretty typical, though it was great to see real crab meat in sushi instead of the imitation stuff, but the black cod was the real star! It was so soft and tasty that it just literally melted in my mouth. I've had cod before, but never quite like this...I don't know if it was just the freshness of the fish or how the prepared it, or a combination of both, but I was so sad that I had to share this dish with two others! This is one of those dishes you will constantly dream about having again years down the road.\n\nOverall had a great culinary experience and plan on bringing my mom here when she visits me in a couple months!!! \n\nRemember to take a picture of the menu so you can remember what dishes you ordered!

We noticed that most walk-ins were waiting 45 minutes to an hour for a table.\n\nEnjoyed the small appetizer pickles that came out in lieu of bread, seemed fitting for an Asian fusion menu. Was really disappointed to find out that the first is complimentary and after that it's $3 but appreciated being told that instead of a surprise on our bill.\n\nStarted with the soft shell crab and tuna tartare. Both were well seasoned with fresh seafood. The presentation was simple but still impressive, which seems to be a theme for the place.\n\nGot the steak with wasabi noodles and fish with spicy noodles for entrees. I was excited to try the wasabi noodles after reading great things about it but I wasn't impressed. They were good but not as strongly flavored or tasty as I had hoped. However, the fish was exceptionally well cooked and the highlight of the evening. Buttery, flavorful and flaky.

They hand wrote gratuity and the total in without saying a word leaving me a bit confused and frustrated given the lack of service we had.

Not what I'm used to because it had an asian flair to it, but the house is an asian fusion restaurant afterall!\n\nAnyway, I already knew ahead of time I was going to order the sea bass with garlic soy noodles and my friend had the kobe steak with wasabi noodles.  Not sure about his dish, but mine was BOMB.  The noodles were chewy and flavored nicely, maybe a little on the salty side (but my tolerance for salty is lower than most).  That SEABASS tho!  Amazing texture, not mushy, not chewy, but just melt in your mouth perfection.  If you come, you must try!  Seafood aficiando or not!  BUT, make sure to make reservations because this place is crackin' even on week nights! \n\n**GREAT DATE PLACE:  fancy food presentation, nice atmosphere, intimate but well lit, great service, and a wine list that pairs great with the food!**", "author": "Jae W."}

I love it. Its just....amazing. Its really hard to infuse Asian cuisine with American food but somehow, 'The House' does it impeccably. I usually put in a reservation before I go here because overall, the restaurant is very small and has limited seating. \n\nI have gone to The House numerous times but the first time I went, I ordered the Warm Wasabi Noodles with steak and its was AMAZING...Oh god.... Although I thought they could have given you more in terms of amount, the food hits you later because some of the dishes are quite rich. \n\nSalmon rolls: Amazing. I usually don't like salmon because its quite dry but they made the rolls impeccably well. \n\nHalibut in Coconut Red Curry: Tasteful, flavorful and well portioned. \n\nIf you want to go somewhere nice but not like fine dining-nice, then this is the place to go. Seriously, like go...\n\nPrices: If you go HAM and order drinks and get seafood, it will come down to 50 per person. But it all depends on what you order.

I ordered the wasabi noodles-- after seeing picture after picture on yelp, my choice was made. It seemed like the best idea, after all the pictures alone were enough to make my mouth water. When I took my first bite, with the highest of expectations, I suddenly found myself disappointed. The best way to describe the dish would be to mix wasabi and soy sauce together, put it on some noodles, and add some reaaally chewy steak-- not impressed. \n\nThe service however, was impeccable--very friendly and efficient.

I will say that every time I come here, I always feel a bit rushed to finish and leave. The space is very small, so if you plan to come with a bigger party be prepared to squeeze in. Because of this, i generally don't plan to come here with more than four. As a party of five, we were squeezed into a table clearly only meant for 4. The person who sat at the \"head\" of the table was constantly scooting in and out to let people pass behind him, which is fairly unpleasant when you're trying to relax and enjoy dinner.

Came here for my mom's birthday, so it was a chance to sample a lot of the dishes. I made reservations the day of, but it's easier to get a table and time that you want if you call to reserve days ahead, since it is a small place.\n\nFor starters, we had the scallops, which is a special there, steamed mussels, and deep fried salmon rolls. The scallops were beautifully seared, with a lemon ponzu sauce. The mussels had a yummy broth, but the mussels were kind of small. I don't eat fish, but my family enjoyed the salmon rolls. \n\nFor the entrees, I had the wasabi noodles with flank steak and there was just a hint of wasabi that did not over power the whole dish. My family got the sea bass, pork chop, and ribeye steak. The pork chop was so juicy and tasted great with the pomegranate sauce, the seasoning for the ribeye was soo good, the sea bass was a hit for my fam. All the entrees were pretty generous in size. \n\nFor desserts, I got to try coconut creme brulee and the chocolate truffle cake with coffee ice cream. They both tasted great. I couldn't taste the coconut in the creme brulee, but I tasted the passion fruit and the sugar on the top was the best part for me. The truffle cake definitely had the chocolate taste to it and I loved the coffee ice cream, who doesn't love ice cream. \n\nI had a great dinner here and it is definitely worth the price for the food and service.", "author": "Susie N."}

Unlike some restaurants, I haven't experienced an \"off day\".  I took my mom and nephew there last month for a 7 pm dinner on a Sunday night.  We had to wait 15 minutes for our table even with a reservation - no big deal as we weren't in a hurry.  The three of us were starving so we ordered 3 appetizers - the salmon roll, barbeque ribs and the day's special, dayboat scallops.  All three were delicious!  For entrees, we ordered the rib eye, the sea bass and the miso black rod.  The sea bass and the black cod were so fresh and melted in our mouths.  My nephew loved the ribeye - the portion was big even for him and he couldn't finish it.  We ordered the chocolate cake for dessert.  \nConsidering the quality of their food, I think this is one of best deals in the city.", "author": "Rica G."}

From then on, not a single staff member said a word to us. An appetizer and some water were brought to us by someone who neither smiled nor acknowledged our existence. \n\nThe table was so dark it was impossible to read the menu without a flashlight. The most frustrating part of the experience was that a couple who arrive after us with no reservation were seated at a much better table.\n\nAfter surveying the situation, my partner and I left.

They're probably the managers? Owners? I've never been so upset before even getting seated at a restaurant before! I made reservations the day before and the lady I spoke with was really nice on the phone. Asked for my credit card because it was for a party of 8, that's fine since I did not plan to cancel. This was a restaurant I've been wanting to try for over 2 years now! So, I was really excited especially because I get to bring my mom and my aunt for an early Mother's Day meal. I got there 10 minutes before 5, which I made reservations for. The door was held opened by a door, so I assumed I can walk in? I did and the lady just stared at me and I said, hi I made reservations at 5. She looked at me and responded with \"ok\" and just continue to stare at me. Uh? So I said ok... And she goes well we're not opened yet. That alone made me upset ! She could have said it nicely and at least let me know what time they'll opened, or better yet, just have seated me. I walked back out and she closed the door right away. It's that serious, huh? The door finally opened and we were finally seated. Throughout dinner, our server was nice and the other servers were as well. None of them likes saying thank you apparently. Or you're welcome. Even when we were helping one of the unfriendly woman with the table and dishes, she did not even bother saying thank you.\n\nBesides for the bad service, the food was alright.

Like a baby bird, I would close my eyes and eat anything they feed me.\n\nFlat iron stake is a beefy example. At other restaurants, the chef pulls out his chewiest piece of meat and autoclaves the beef until it resembles a leather belt your dad used to beat you. The chef then camouflages it with sauces of subterfuge to hoodwink you into believing that you're eating food. The menu says steak, but you think mis-steak!\n\nThe flat iron steak at The House, in contrast, is rendered tender and subtly spiced, before shacking up with the wasabi noodles--thick-cut signature noodles touch you with a fabled \"green flash\" of wasabi heat at the final brush with the tongue. This dish recalls the aspirations of metallurgy: aluminum is whisked into gold. \n\nTheir seafood dishes, priced  in the mid-20s, are creations you will dream of. The sea bass has a shell of soy-glazed crispiness that makes you wonder if they are raising sea bass in a tank of soy. Once you break through the sub-millimeter of crispiness, the supple middle makes you wonder: is having a mouth full of teeth a little overrated?\n\nThis food isn't fusion--it's evolution.\n\n--\n\nPS, Make a reservation or you'll be standing in their 9 cubic foot doorway with 10 other hungry, sad customers for an hour smelling sea bass and contemplating \n\nPPS, they give away your reservation after 20 minutes late, so need to plan on 30 minutes looking for parking, before you give up and park your car in the middle of Washington Square Park.

I think I enjoyed his pork chop more as it was very tender, juicy and not over cooked. We also split the fried salmon appetizer, which was delicious, except for the wasabi dipping sauce it came with. It was just too strong and neither of us can really stand wasabi.\n\nFor dessert we decided to split the mango tapioca and the coconut creme brule with passion fruit sauce. I have to say I was under-impressed this time with the latter, as the first time I had it you could taste the coconut in the creme brule more as well as more passionfruit puree. The mango tapioca was cold, creamy and refreshing though.\n\nI was just a little disappointed though that after stating we were celebrating our anniversary, other than a candle glued onto the plate of our dessert, nothing was really said to us or written out on the plate. I am wondering how they would even acknowledge someone's special occasion if they didn't order dessert..stick a candle on your check? Otherwise, if nothing is complimentary, there is really no point in leaving a note when making reservations.\n\nI'm sorry, The House, while serving really delicious and upscale food for reasonable prices, has missed it's mark this time around with the service being a little inattentive (we came right at 11:30am when they opened and only 2 other tables were there) and not really putting in much effort in the anniversary presentation, given that we were charged for both desserts, even writing out happy birthday in chocolate syrup in addition to an awkwardly placed candle would have been a nice gesture for choosing to celebrate with them.\n\nOverall, I would still come back for the food but perhaps not for something like an anniversary. Definitely get the pork chop if you can't decide and the Tuna Ahi Tartar, which wasn't on the menu this time or a special, but something I enjoyed a great deal with first time I dined here.\n\nDriving around this area is probably the worst, so try to take public transit or stick with a weekday during lunch.

Usually I expect 2 dinky round pieces but they shaped it into something like a big pear. It was big enough for all 7 of us to have a good bite out of it. Lots of crab and not filled with batter. The \"Asian fusion\" part of it here was a hint of wasabi which was pretty good!\nSoft shell crab tempura (special for the day):\n\nEntrees:\nKurobuta pork chop: TENDERRR. It had like a sweet BBQ sauce which was pretty good but I wanted something super savory. This is awesome if you like BBQ,\n\nWasabi noodles with flank steak: I've been hearing so much about this! I actually didn't taste the wasabi in the wasabi noodle? I kind of expected a plain or green noodle but it was more of like.. a  red-brown colored sauce. It looked \"cheap\" but was pretty damn good. HELLLA flank steak too. And it was cooked perfectly!\n\nRib eye steak: MY FAVORITE!!!!!!!!!!! I ordered the wasabi noodles and my BF got this. THIS ended up being my fav, while my BF liked my dish more. OMG this rib eye was sooooo damn tender and such a big portion. Again, perfectly cooked and LOADS of fried garlic on top. YUM!\n\nSea bass: I don't usually like fish, but this was soooooo good. Perfectly flaky fish with good flavoring. Slightly crisp, and also a big portion.\n\nDessert:\nRhubarb and strawberry pie (or something? it was a special): The pie was good.. nothing like AMAZING but def above average pie. To be honest, the mango pudding stole my heart away!\n\nMango pudding: Iuno, this is pretty standard for most Asian places. But OMG this mango pudding is so good and prob one of the best I've had. It's so creamy and smooth, alot of places have this all hard, thick or powdery tasting but not here!! There was also enough of the condensed milk (many places don't have enough) and it was diluted a bit for the perfect texture. I also tasted some ginger or coconut in there.

The pork chop was a pretty good portion, and the pomegranate currant sauce gave it some sweetness. The play between the sweet and savory was nice. The fried Alaskan halibut from the daily special menu came with the roasted cauliflower, which I enjoyed. We finished the meal with chai panna cotta, topped with strawberries and mangos. It was good, but nothing memorable.\n\nAll in all, we liked the meal. I'm not sure if I would go out of my way for it again.

Last time when she was in SF 2yrs. ago, she enjoyed it so much so I couldn't say no to her. \n\nWe had reservations at 9pm and still had to wait about 20mins. When we did get seated, the kind waiter came and was very attentive. He was telling us the special for the evening but I really didn't understand him clearly. No matter, I knew what I was having. I went for 3 small dishes: octopus, Caesar salad with I believe deep fried scallops and the dumplings. My favorite was the octopus. It was cooked perfectly, the sauce was a small amount of mayo and some tangy chili sauce. The salad was okay, nothing to write home about, same for the dumpling. \n\n My sister has the salad with the pork skin and another item I am forgetting now and the deep fried green beans. The salad was interesting. It was a sweet vinaigrette dressing but what made the dish fun were the deep fried pork skins. Green beans were okay...just okay. The sauce that accompanied it was this soya sauce with lots of green onion. \n\nMy niece had their famous sea bass entree. That was very good and fresh! It was served with some noodles that resembled Dan Dan mein and stir fried green beans. \n\nThe ambiance is cramped, on the dark side and loud. But everyone is having a grand time. Since the place is small, the tables are very close to each other. If you are on an intimate date, there's not much talking without raising your voice.\n\nPrices are high. Our meal for 3 of us came to be about 150.00. I am not a huge fan but I know The House has a wonderful reputation for consistency. Better to go for lunch if the pocketbook is tight.

Sauce was some kind of vinegar and soy sauce but all you needed was a nice spritz of lemon over these babies.\n\nEntrees:\n-Angus ribeye steak: Best dish out of the entrees. Nice flavor. The grilled cauliflowers had a smoky flavor and were delicious. \n-Wasabi noodles with Angus flatiron steak: forgettable. This cut of steak wasn't as flavorful as its ribeye counterpart. You could taste the wasabi in the noodles. The fat noodles has a pleasing chewy texture but were too greasy.   \n-Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy sauce: Fish was fine but forgettable. Sauce didn't really do anything for me. This dish was also served with the housemade noodles in a greasy sauce that I don't remember. The green beans served alongside the fish was so oily. What's the point of covering vegetables in so much oil if it's not the good kind of fat (i.e. animal fat)?\n\nDesserts:\n-Chocolate cake with coffee ice cream: Cake was nicely dense and had a dark chocolate flavor. Overall, dish was decent but definitely not worth over $8.\n-Coconut creme brul\u00e9e with passion fruit sauce: Texture of the creme brulee was firm and silky smooth. I couldn't really taste coconut but the consistency and texture of the creme brulee made up for it. And it was fun to crack the shell of sugar on top.\n\nOverall, I was not impressed. Service was fine. Our waitress was attentive and our water was always refilled. But for the prices, the dishes should be more creative or just taste like something else beside grease.", "author": "Julia T."}

Wherever you're coming from, I'd recommend allotting time for traffic/looking for parking. We got to our reservation on time, and 10 minutes later, the entire restaurant was packed. Avg. wait was 45min-1hr after that point. Moral of the story, DEFINITELY make reservations or get there exactly at opening!\n\nI ordered one of their specials, and if I remember correctly, it was a ribeye steak with mushrooms and truffle reduction. WHAT!? Yeah, just typing that out made me salivate. It was ... divine. My friend was so jealous. He ordered the wasabi noodles with steak -- the noodles were tasty, but he wish he had my steak to go with it; his was kind of bland. Sry, you gots to get your own. \n\n**Side note: Since we got there at opening, we got to choose where we wanted to sit, and we opted for the table right in front of the window. People who passed by literally stopped and looked at our food, ooohing and ahhhing. I interacted with them a couple of times, demonstrating my steak-cutting skills or giving them a thumbs up and mouthing out \"sooooo good.\" They were very entertained (I think). I should get a star for positive advertisement of this restaurant. Or not, depending on if I was either entertaining or creepy.\n\nIt was a pretty pricey meal, but I didn't care.

This small restaurants has very few tables but the food is served in a timely manner and the wait staff is very kind and conscious   of the customers waiting. For appetizers (small plates), we started with the deep-fried salmon roll and steamed mussels. The salmon rolls were tasty but the mussels were mouth watering. The rolls were served with a spicy mustard so gauge your tolerance before you smother your roll in it like I did. The mussels were served in a great sauce with garlic bread slices; I could have eaten this whole appetizer myself. For main dishes, we ordered the ribeye and alaskan cod special. The ribeye was cooked to a tee and the cod was marinated in a delicious sauce plus the sushi rolls on top were key. For dessert, we ordered the apple crumb pie and chocolate truffle cake. The pie was served warm with a hint of cinnamon cooked into the apple slices. The chocolate cake was totally worth every single rich and gooey bite.

Presentation was done well, with three large taro chips stacked with ahi, one resting on top of another.  Seasoned with nori & sea salt, nothing really stood out about the flavor.\n\n We moved onto the crispy salmon skin rolls, which was also presented beautifully.  It consisted of two traditional salmon skin rolls, fried on the outside, then cut diagonally (for 4 pieces).  It was good, but I felt like I could order this at any sushi restaurant.\n\nAs for the entree, we had the black cod dish, with a side of garlic noodles.  The dish itself consisted of a small piece of miso marinated black cod, 3 pieces of sashimi, and two long california rolls (stretched out).  It wasn't anything new - I've tasted similar miso marinated black cod (for cheaper) at izakaya restaurants in the peninsula, and the sushi I could have gotten at any sushi place.  The wasabi garlic noodles tasted like the ones I ordered from ben tre in SSF, with a slight wasabi aftertaste (but it was so subtle, I almost didn't taste it).\n\nOverall, I thought the food was good.  The tastes aren't unique; you can likely order similar dishes at any japanese restaurant.

Sea bass is also good, though it can be a bit oily.\n\nI came here recently and had their house special, cod with some teriyaki type glaze with fresh crab avocado rolls on top. It was sooooo good! Their mushroom rice was good as well, my cousin said that it was better than risotto!", "author": "Christina C."}

I was looking forward to a buttery texture but ended up having to cut every bite with a knife. The fish didn't taste fresh, instead it tasted as if it was previously frozen.

For those having extensive experience with serious traditional Asian fare, one can't help but cringe a bit in apprehension on the inside.\n\nThe House, however, will dash that thought right out of your head with just one (epic) meal.\n\nEven before my friends and I had a chance to peruse the menu, we were intrigued by the presentation and intoxicating aroma of the ginormous entrees being served to neighboring tables.  As a result, we were torn about only ordering a couple shared small plates and a main dish for everyone with so many great options in front of us.  The solution?  Get nearly every small plate and go for broke on the main =D\n\nWe hit nearly every point on the spectrum with the top offerings being the much raved about Deep Fried Salmon Roll as well as the American Wagyu Beef Tartare & Uni sashimi special.  The salmon's great texture transitioned from fully-cooked flaky meat on the outer edges towards a raw core, all wrapped up in delightfully thin and crispy batter.  The horseradish in the accompanying mustard matched superbly and made each bite a pleasure.  On the cooler side, the sashimi was beautifully presented and included components such as paper-thin apple slices and bits of toast that complemented the creamy tartare and uni both in texture and flavor range.\n\nOur Steamed Mussels and Coconut Curry Clams special were also huge hits and outshone all the iterations I've had in Boston.  The mussels had a lovely brininess and the curry makes you want to sop every last bit up with grilled bread.  While we're doing a little comparison to Beantown, the Maine Crab Cake here came out on top as well with light, creamy texture and not a hint of excess grease.\n\nThe others including Deep Fried Soft Shell Crab, White Shrimp and Chinese Chive Dumplings and Grilled Octopus.  The freshness of the ingredients made their presence known right away, but they didn't stand out nearly as much in general.  Go for them if you have the appetite, otherwise they can be skipped for the mains.\n\n...Which leads me to the Warm Wasabi House Noodles.  Every one of us agreed that the angus flatiron steak was tender to the next level.  Ridonkulously tender?  Yeah, that sounds about right.  The noodles underneath brought back memories of Dan Dan noodles with awesomely spicy flavor.  Suffice it to say, I could've inhaled the entire thing in minutes and left with a glorious food coma.\n\nIf you're still reading this, thanks for bearing with me ;)  We couldn't finish without nabbing a dessert...or three in the form of Coconut Creme Brulee, Dark Chocolate Cake and the Blueberry Tart special.  Not a single one lasted much longer than 60 seconds as evidenced by the clashing of spoons left and right.  If you had to pick one though, get on that creme brulee - flawless execution rounded out by lovely passionfruit puree on top.\n\nLastly, the logistics.  The House is indeed on the smaller side with cozy seating arrangements and surprisingly moderate noise levels...always a big plus in my book!  Service was very helpful with ordering and consistently timely throughout the meal.  And the damage?  A mere $50/person with tax & tip included for what was essentially a DELICIOUS and filling 12-course meal.  Aim for about a week in advance to place reservations and come ready for excellent food that really lives up to every last bit of the hype.", "author": "Eric F."}

I had an excellent dinner here for my 3 year anniversary. The staff was very nice and all of our dishes was excellent! And if you're like my boyfriend and I, go crazy on the appetizers because they are ALL delicious. \n\nRecommendations: \n- Caesar Salad w Deep Fried Scallops : perfectly dressed and the scallops were tender and juicy with a light batter.\n- Maine Crab Cake : Excellent plating, cooked perfectly with a delicious sauce to compliment. \n- Blue Lake Bean Tempura : Awesome crisscross tower of lightly battered green beans with a great soy dipping sauce. (This was my favorite!) \n- Grilled Sea Bass w Garlic Noodles : MUST GET! Perfectly cooked sea bass that went well with the green beans and garlic noodles. And I loved that the sauce was on the side to not over flavor the plate. \n- Mushroom Rice w Grilled Prawns : Just yum yum yummy! Perfectly grilled prawns that go great with the mushroom rice. Only downside is that I found it to be a bit oily.\n- Crumb Apple Pie a-la-mode : You can definitely make room for this scrumptious dessert because it is THE perfect end to a delectable dinner. \n\nTips: Parking is difficult in the area and the restaurant is small, so make a reservation.", "author": "Sharon L."}

I was disappointed with the \"Asian Fusion food\" and haven't been back.  Last week, I happened to come here b/c the original dining choice I had was actually closed for renovation.  Coming in as a walk-in, I expected to wait, and was told it would be around 20 mins - not bad for a walk-in.  20 mins had gone by, then another 20 mins and another 20 mins, and finally after 1+hr, me/friend got our table.   Well, I am not complaining.. but I am just stating the fact.\n\nAppetizers: \n- Seared Scallops: one of the specials of the night.  For some people this might have been on the raw side, but for me it was perfect.  \n- Deep Fried Salmon Roll was goood!!! \n\nMain Course: \n- Sea Bass with Wasabi Noodle was perfectly done\n- Seared White Tuna (one of the specials of the night again), it was decent but not the best.  The California (?) roll that came with it was good though.  \n\nI would say this time around, I have changed my mind about the food at this restaurant.  I am a little torn between giving it a 3 or a 4 stars.  The food is good, but the restaurant is small, the plates are a little lacking, and parking sucks in that neighborhood!  \n\nOh, almost forgot.. they actually have a few interesting Japanese Beer choices.  Ok, that did it to boost my rating to 4 stars.", "author": "Lillian T."}

Constant fire drills and just difficulty at every major milestone. So to boost our morale I decide to have a team dinner and to get us out of the office earlier than 6 for once. Searched around on yelp and The House seemed to be the perfect venue for a nice low key dinner with great food. \nDefinitely make reservations for this joint because even when we showed up right at 5:30, there were people already waiting outside. Once the doors opened, we were greeted by the host and they quickly sat our group down at a table. The restaurant is definitely on the smaller side and has a nice cozy feel to it. We started to peruse the dinner and drinks menu and I was pretty pumped to try out the contemporary Asian American fusion food. For some reason our group was under the impression that the main dishes would be small so we decided to order three appetizers including the tuna tartare, crab cake, and the sashimi. I would say the crab cakes were a bit dry for my taste and the sashimi just seemed standard to me adding nothing creative. The Tuna tartare was solid but again nothing that really made me feel it was creative. \nFor the entr\u00e9e I ordered the Warm Wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak and my co workers ordered the Angus ribeye steak. Honestly when the plates came out I was pretty jealous of the ribeye my coworkers received but with one bit of my warm wasabi house noodles I was blown away. The steak was ordered medium rare and it came out perfectly cooked with the right level of pink. The noodles were just bomb. Great flavor and texture to them. I ate everything and was probably ended up licking the plate hoping that more would fall magically onto it.  My co workers devoured their ribeye as well saying it was really well cooked and just melt in your mouth good. I wish I had the chance to take a bite but I was way too busy with my dish to even notice the other plates. The portions were actually very generous as well which I was surprised about. \nThe entrees were definitely the star of the show and I could see the creativity coming through. Although the appetizers were a bit disappointing, the main dishes had me leaving very content and happy. Hoping to be back to get more of those wasabi noodles.", "author": "Dan M."}

(I hate teriyaki sauce). My bf had the shrimp with bonito flakes which he thought was decent. My sis had the seared ribeye and noodles which she liked. The creme brulee was very good (my opinion, since I loved the fruit sauce on top) and my sis thought the sauce was weird, but the underlying cream was very good. Can't please everyone.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-04-18", "description": "This restaurant doesn't need another review, but here goes.  The complaints about lack of authenticity baffle me.  This is Asian fusion.  It doesn't adhere to one particular style of Asian cuisine, which is partly why I like fusion food.  It's interesting and unexpected but familiar all at the same time.  I mean, unagi sandwich?  Heck yes, sign me up!\n\nUnfortunately the sandwich wasn't on the menu when I went in March.  As much as I wanted to love The House, only one of the dishes we ordered was worth the trip, and that was the wasabi garlic noodles.  A little oily, mildly spicy, but full of strong garlic flavor.  It killed my breath, but my tastebuds didn't care.  The other dishes were less interesting in comparison but still good.  The pork that came with the noodles was a little dry.  Kurobuta pork chop with pomegranate sauce was slightly sweet and a nice pairing of flavors, but the meat was also dry.  The flank steak was well-cooked but not a stand-out dish.\n\nThe restaurant space is modern and rather minimalistic but charming.  It's a little cramped but creates a cozy atmosphere.  Service can be a little brusque, probably because they're busy.  Do make a reservation.       \n\nA note to the out-of-towners: If you go during the day, the area is totally safe and walkable.  We didn't want to attempt street parking and found a structure only a couple of blocks away.  It was a cool structure (each parking space has a fortune cookie-style aphorism printed on the ground), but for what we paid ($9 for 2 hrs), it would have been more worth it to try the street.

They don't take reservations so if you don't want to wait get there when they open. The food was excellent. We enjoyed our meal. I ordered the lobster tempura as an appetizer. We ordered the special cod with the crab and avocado roll on top and the prawns. The portions are small so if you are watching you waist line this is your place. I had four prawns on my plate. Not a meal to fill up on but on the upside it leaves room for desert. Since it's located in San Francisco's north side probably a walk to place. The place was clean and the service was great as well.

Though I'd recommend getting these two dishes on separate visits (similar tones of flavor in wasabi and spicy mustard).\n\nThe venue is pretty small and cozy, with some bare decor. It got a bit loud at times, making it hard to hear each other, but probably because it was a Fri night in a pretty lively bar area.

My beau and I are often skeptical of places dubbed as \"fusion,\" particularly \"Asian fusion,\" so we went in with no expectations. We made a reservation a week in advance for a large party, and because of the small restaurant, we were asked that we finish in 1.5 hours because of the demand (which would later be confirmed, because near the end of our time it was already 10pm and another party was waiting to eat). The restaurant was PACKED. There's only a small bathroom in the back (and there's a very narrow pass to the kitchen, so be a wall--a very tall wall). \n\nTIP: A friend called in to special request their miso black cod...which would later be like a total clouds-parting moment.\n\nOur waitress was very nice, We ordered several appetizers, such as their mussels and salad, which were all very tasty. It's good to buy several with a group and just pass it around the table. As for the entrees, my special ordered cod was EXCEPTIONAL. Instead of it coming with its sushi (which is made interestingly flat and long), I opted for their udon noodles. They brought this out on a separate plate, which made my meal of excellent value. The noodles are very good, remniscient of zha jiang mian (Chinese/Koreans, you knows it!). \n\nThe sirloin and wasabi noodles were really good, which have a nice kick to it without giving you a nasal flare. Someone in the group also got the fish with squid ink risotto, which I was really jealous of. \n\nThere was one staffer who seemed to be the manager, who wasn't a chipper girl when she came to our table or just in general around the restaurant.

The guy was taking me to a \"surprise place\", which just happened to be that focacccia bakery in North Beach (Liguria Bakery?) that I had been to many many times, so it wasn't like a new place for me.  We couldn't find parking but , no big deal because this was a perfect time to TRY to find parking and go to The House.  We found parking, very close to the place.\n\nWell, it really was fantastic.  We walked right in without a reservation.  It was around 1:00 on a weekday.\n\nWe started with the famous deep fried crispy salmon roll.  The portion is generous and 2 can share. It is served with a delicious cabbage slaw and a wasabi dipping sauce. The sauce was a perfect accompaniment to the roll. The guy had clams in spicy broth.  This was a fantastically yum dish.  The broth was so good that he asked the wait person to leave the bowl on the table so he could anoint his udon soap (the next dish ) with the broth,  She wasn't even grossed out!\n\nThe grilled Chilean sea bass was the best piece of fish  I've had in a long time.

I am not too sure whether they are punctual with their reservations, because there were a few other parties with reservations that had to wait as well. I guess it doesn't hurt to make reservations anyway though, because the restaurant is tiny and it can get really crowded and cramped.\n\nThe menu was very brief with one dish that really stood out to me, the warm wasabi house noodles with Angus flatiron steak--so naturally I went with that! We also ordered two appetizers to share: deep-fried salmon roll with Chinese hot mustard (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZoZjbOYR-apY8XvommlNUA?select=msgiohj2b-V_lBcpOR2Ylw) and the blue lake bean tempura (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZoZjbOYR-apY8XvommlNUA?select=rNqngEvu6IK8pTsO6ENafw). The appetizers were beautifully presented and tasted wonderful. The deep-fried salmon roll was warm and buttery. The blue lake bean tempura was lightly battered and deep-fried to perfection. \n\nThe main course, the warm wasabi house noodles with steak (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZoZjbOYR-apY8XvommlNUA?select=z6j2IuQYn5c3XrkRm_NwJA) was bursting with flavor. The warm wasabi noodles left a brief and subtle burning sensation in my mouth that was quickly neutralized with the steak and slaw. The steak was a little on the chewier side, but edible. I sneaked in a taste of my girlfriend's grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZoZjbOYR-apY8XvommlNUA?select=meORaV5F01gLsACwVapEeg) and it was heavenly! The sea bass was so crispy and blackened on the exterior, but still very flaky inside.\n\nThe staff was very knowledgeable and attentive. I am usually skeptical of Asian Fusion places, because their food is always lacking. The House is far form lacking; I was very impressed. I do recommend giving them a try!", "author": "Lien T."}

Topless clubs, sex toy shops (one next door), and what looked to be hookers puffing on very pungent smelling weed. That said, it's also right next to Chinatown and lots of small Italian cafes, which really captures the bustling, eclectic essence of San Francisco in my opinion. \n\nThe restaurant itself was easy to find though, in spite of being so small (probably the size of someone's walk-in-closet), due to the logo being so large and legible. Walking in, I was a bit shocked by how many people they were able to cram into such a small space, and, jumping ahead, was even more shocked later when a chubbier lady almost knocked my plate down with her bottom when trying to scoot in between the 8 inch space between tables, to get to her seat. So, I really can't say this is  a place with much ambiance, when you can also hear the word for word conversations of the tables on either side of you. \n\nTo start the dinner, they provided us with a complimentary pickled cucumber side dish, which was way too sour and acidic. Then the server went through the specials and menu, and we settled on 3 entrees: \n\n\n\"Warm Wasabi House Noodles with Angus Flatiron steak\" ($19)- Okay, tasty enough, but pretty standard stuff. Tasted like  stir-fry, teriyaki noodles flavored with wasabi then topped with a layer of cucumbers, a layer of cabbage/red pepper (best part), and a layer of sliced steak. The steak was particularly awful, I got it in medium rare, and it was so chewy. It was hard to cut even with the steak knife that they provided.  Would never get again.. \n\n \"Kurobuta Pork Chop with Pomegranate Currant Sauce\" ($25)- This is a  one inch thick and 5 inch in diameter slice of bone-in pork sitting in a sweet pomegranate sauce, with a side of mashed potatoes, 2 asparagus, and 2 slices of deep fried taro. The pork was tender, fatty and purposely under-cooked (we questioned the server about that but the server replied that it's \"high quality pork\", thus is okay?). The sweet, fruity sauce really overwhelmed the flavor of the pork though, so it just tasted like some kind of grilled meat covered in sugar/fruit. The best part of this dish was the steamed asparagus (so tender and fresh), and the mashed potatoes. The secret to the mashed potatoes was probably the infusion of kombu and bonito, a mixture I've had before.\n\n \"Sesame Soy Glazed Salmon in Bonito Sake Broth\" ($23)- This was a lady hand- sized slice of very tender, fresh, sesame, soy glazed grilled salmon sitting on a bed of slightly bitter, Chinese mustard greens called Jie Cai, topped with a sheet of seaweed, pretty slice of turnip?(didn't taste like anything, literally there for the prettiness factor), and a bit of fish roe. All this was sitting in a dashi broth and served with a plate of rice. The salmon tasted amazing, but everything else was pretty standard. \n\nOverall, I don't feel like the price of any of these dishes is all that justified. The portions are pretty large, but I would have prefer more amazing-ness over quantity. The best part of eating here was the night that followed. After leaving the restaurant, we strolled down Grant ave. for what was left of the China town parade,  and within 30 minutes my stomach started feeling queasy and heavy. Then, within three hours, I threw up $70 from my stomach and within nine hours, I lost the $18 that had made it's way into my intestines. \n\nFood poisoning aside, the 3 stars is really just for their food, just because I cannot 100% conclude that the food poisoning derived from here, and not from the milk and Cheerios that I had earlier in the day.", "author": "Patty C."}

We got seated at 10:10pm and on to our table we went.   We got our waters immediately and some pickled cucumber dish.  It may have been because I was a little inebriated ( I had a beer before coming) but the pickled cucumbers they give you were delicious.  I saw people not eating them and I could not fathom why!  I was ready to just ask everyone if they wanted to donate theirs to me, but I held myself together.   Another tiny plate is $3 ...so don't eat them too fast haha (...I think I'm the only one that really liked them lol).\n\nA few minutes later, a waitress came over and told us about the specials!  I don't remember anything she said except Halibut and mashed potatoes and I decided that was what I was going to get.  My boyfriend ordered the Angus Ribeye Steak.  And for starters, we got the scallops.  I'm sure you already know how I felt about the scallops...they were divine in all their buttery glory.  So tender and flavorful.  They only give you 3 so savor them while you can.  I really do wish I could have these everyday...if not once a week...basically more often than I'm having them now.  They are delicious.  Try them. \n\nProbably 10-15 minutes later the food was out already (mind you, it was late -1030 pm or so haha)! My halibut was in some creme sauce.  I'm not a fan of creme sauce but for that halibut, I'll eat anything.  The halibut was like butter.  Perfectly cooked and was a wonderful combination with the creme sauce.  The mashed potatoes weren't anything special, but it was fine because the halibut was obviously the star of this dish.  My boyfriend's steak was medium cooked.  It was really good and also tender.   I'm having a hard time articulating the deliciousness of it all, so you're probably just gonna have to try it if you haven't already.\n\nI was already full after finishing my plate, which I pretty much vacuumed up, but I figured that it was a good decision to get dessert.  We ordered the strawberry rhubarb crumb.  Aghhhhhhhhh it was so gooooooood.  It came with a scoop of ice cream. It was lightly sweet and tart at the same time, both of which complimented nicely with the ice cream.  \n\nThe only issues I had with this place are : (1) that it's tiny, which is not bad...but seating could take a while without reservation; and (2) it's kind of pricey.  But I mean, for a special occasion or something, it's perfect.  \n\nAlso, the staff is nice.  The hostess was a small Asian woman.  She was very nice, patient and welcoming, despite the restaurant being very busy.   The waitresses were the same.  It just made the overall dining experience that much better. \n\nDo it do it do it go go go. Treat yo'self! It's worth it.", "author": "Vivian L."}

The decor is very simple and clean but the food makes up for its simplicity.  Asian fusion has always made me skeptic but this place proved me wrong.  The dishes are plentiful and very well plated.  I must emphasize very WELL plated for a little restaurant like this.  It would make you feel like you are in a fine dining dinner but in a smaller scale venue.  \n\nWhat we ordered:\n\n1. Deep Fried Salmon roll with chinese hot mustard- I loved this!  It felt like I was eating an eggroll with medium rare cooked salmon in the middle, which is hard to master.  The chinese mustard sauce, take it a bit at a time. It definitely is strong!\n\n2. Warm wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak- I was scared for the challenge of eating wasabi noodles but this was nothing to be feared!  Green noodles with a hint of wasabi, which went well with the steak.  It wasn't overpowering at all!  Definitely unique in its combination!\n\n3. Chicken breast with roasted portabella white truffle oil sauce- the meat was so moist and tender.  it went perfectly well with the mashed truffle sauce potatoes that came with it. my boyfriend was absolutely in love with it\n\nWe didn't get to try their desserts but we will definitely next time when we are in the city!

I usually don't like asian fusion restaurants because they tend to muddle too many different flavors from different asian cultures and therefore loses authenticity of certain tastes, but this place seems to focus more specifically on Japanese fusion. Anyways, I've been here 3 times before, and it's always consistently blew me away in every aspect. \n\nI've had: \n- Mushroom Risotto with Shrimp: When the dish first came out, I was worried because I saw a plate of risotto topped with bonito flakes, and that's not the first thing you think of in terms of flavor combination. But, it was amazing! the risotto was creamy, but not heavy and the bonito flakes ended up being a great complement to the dish.  The dish came with 4 large pieces of grilled shrimps that seemed fresh, were cooked to perfection, and bonus: they were all peeled and cleaned. \n- Green bean Tempura: light, crispy but not greasy, and surprisingly flavorful. Though it was a really good dish, it wasn't anything extremely unique in terms of flavors, but definitely a good starter dish!\n- Scallops with Ponzu sauce (special): Love this dish! This dish comes with 3-4 scallops on top of a ponzu sauce and topped with some greens. The scallops are cooked PERFECTLY and the sauce + greens add a very bright note to the dish. \n- Tuna Tartare with Nori Chips: pretty good! the nori chips are really good on this dish and the tuna is fresh and marinated well, but nothing too spectacular compared to some of the other starters they offer \n- Wasabi Noodles with Steak: YUM. This is one of the most popular dishes here. the noodles are stir-fried udon noodles, and it packs in some amazing flavors! It has a little bit of spice, but nothing too spicy. I think the steak can be a bit chewy but, nothing that can't be overlooked. \n- Grilled Seabass with Green beans: This is probably my favorite dish here. You get a choice of rice or garlic noodles- I would recommend the garlic noodles! They use udon noodles instead of the traditional egg noodles that are commonly used for garlic noodles, but the flavors are still great, if not better! The seabass is cooked perfectly and the sauce that comes on the side with it only  enhances the flavors. The green beans may LOOK bland at first, but they're also packed with a garlicky flavor without too much oil or grease and with a nice crunch! \n\nThe prices might seem a little high at first, but for the quality AND the quantity of all the dishes, it's worth every penny!

Actually, every meat here is perfectly cooked, super tender and extremely flavorful. The pork chop dish was great, especially the pomegranate currant sauce it was sitting in. The wasabi noodles with steak, which was recommended to me by my buddy Kent D,  was great too. The noodles had such a great flavor. I could have eaten bowls and bowls of those noodles alone. The chocolate cake was so rich and decedent. It was a great way to end a phenomenal meal.\n\nThe prices here aren't bad considering how fantastic the food is and how large the portions are. The service was top notch as well.\n\nHonestly, I have dined at many restaurants in SF and The House could be my favorite thus far. My entire experience at The House was flawless.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-09-29", "description": "It's a shame because they serve the type of food that is deserving of at least 4 stars but the ambience is that of a 2 star Japanese sushi joint you would typically find scattering the streets of NYC.  First, let me give the props. The pork chops were delicious. The pomegranate sauce had a nice balance of tangy and sweet and worked very well with the pork chop which was cooked to perfection.  It's a hefty size so you won't be aching for more when you are done. The wasabi noodles fell a bit short though. The wasabi flavor should have been more center stage but it wasn't and it just felt like we were eating plain udon noodles with slices of beef. Not bad but for all the hype, it fell short.\n\nNow, what they could do better.  Look, I think if you're going to charge upscale prices for the food you serve, then you owe it to your guests to create the atmosphere to go with the price. And it doesn't take much - a table cloth of some sort, maybe some candles, flowers, little potted plants, or anything on the table would've been nice to create a soft and intimate mood which the layout of the space easily lends itself to be. Also, so much can be done with lighting. It was so bright in there, I think an investment in some softer lighting by the owner would help.  \n\nSo, to summarize imagine the contrast - tasty, creative well-cooked food served on naked, cracking, chipped yellow wooden table with bright cafeteria lighting.  Really, I think the space could do so much more and is screaming for a makeover.", "author": "Syddie P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-03-08", "description": "It's not the most romantic setting, but The House definitely delivers some awesome food.\n\nThe Ambiance:\n\nThis place is pretty small and loud. It's not the best place to have an easy conversation without raising your voice a few times. The decor is pretty simple and sparse, and doesn't quite match the caliber of the food (but being Asian, and used to Asian places, I didn't really care too much). \n\nOne unusual aspect of this place was that they seemed to give you time limits on your table. As patrons were walking into the door, the hostess would say \"We can seat you as long as we have to table back by __ o'clock\". Even though we made a reservation, we were still told that we had an hour and a half limit at our table. I understand that this system allows for more efficient seating and maximizes the number of diners per night, but it feels odd to be pressured to finish by a certain time. \n\nThe Food:\n\nFried Salmon Rolls ($9): Each serving came with four \"pieces\" (two long and two short) of the roll. The rolls were cooked just enough for the salmon to remain slightly raw on the inside, which was awesome. Dipped in the hot mustard, it was a flavor explosion in your mouth.\n\nGrilled Sea bass ($26): Following a personal craving for sea bass recently, I had to try it out, and it was very good. Generous portion of fish with a nice grilled flavor. It wasn't the absolute best melt-in-yo'-mouth sea bass I've had, but it was pretty damn close. The garlic ginger soy was tasty, but salty, so be careful and don't just douse your fish in it. The noodles and snow peas that complemented the fish were done well, and comprised a filling and satisfying meal. \n\nOne friend got the Angus Ribeye ($25), and as a bonafide steak lover, definitely enjoyed his generous cut of meat. another friend got the Pork Chop ($23) and was also satisfied with his meal, particularly the pomegranate sauce that came with it.  \n\nService:\n\nThey allowed us to sit at our table while two of our friends went to find parking (parking blows around here), so that was cool. The waitress was brisk, and waters were refilled on several occasions. The food came out at a pretty good pace, which supports their notion of turning tables over in a timely manner. Overall, no real complaints here.\n\nAlthough I get suspicious when a place boasts \"Asian Fusion\", The House will not disappoint in treating you to some awesome food without superfluous frills.", "author": "Greg L."}

It's pretty much almost impossible to spot the place out unless you know you're going there.  Either way, this place has to be one of the best dining experiences I've had so far in my life!\n\nThe first time we came here, my friend's relative that lives in NorCal introduced us to, THE HOUSE.  It was closed LOL. We didn't get a chance that day since it was full of exploring and sight seeing and such.  I believe we came back the next day and finally stepped foot into this fine establishment.  Yet being so tiny and confined since the seating was limited to about 10 or so, the ambiance of the place completely nullifies that.  It's really nice being in there and the staff is good. Moving on-\n\nThe dishes were very interesting as I've never had Asian fusion before of this quality.  My friend's relative mentioned a Pork Chop dish, that seemingly wasn't on the menu, at all.  So I guess it was a seasonal dish maybe?  But they were able to make it anyways.  We all order different dishes and had some appetizers but I don't remember the names of them since well its about a few years since I was there (this review is years behind LOL but I have pictures!  Just check them out and salivate)\n\nSo I'm going to be talking about the pork chop a lot, gonna tell you right now haha.  IT WAS DELICIOUS.  The currant reduction sauce was out of this world.  The presentation was amazing.  The Chop itself was juicy and the flavor was jizz in my pants.  I just couldn't believe how good it really was.  We told the workers there we're from Long Beach and we drove all the way here just to eat here, which is pretty much a half truth. :D\n\nFast forward another year or two, we're all back again here at the house and the guess what?  The Pork Chop is now on the menu haha.  It was a Kurobuta Pork Chop with pomegranate and currant reduction sauce.  We had it again (of course) and it was still delicious.  I honestly couldn't stop thinking about it for about a week after consuming it haha.  I honestly can't wait to come back and have it again, along with any other new specials or items.\n\n(The chop!)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=3V6n8hmTxwbM0Og7wzE4yQ&userid=Z4d49-dnAja73lufAlIORw\n\nTHE HOUSE!", "author": "Johnie H."}

This should really be called \"Oh My Cod\" because surely you'll repeat an \"omg\" expression of some sort throughout consumption.\n\nThe cod itself is a perfect white fish that picks up flavor well. The chef cooks it to tender perfection: buttery, moist and subtly sweet meat, the thin layer of fish fat left attached, and skin that holds a slight crisp.\n\nIt sits on greens that are cooked as is, providing that refreshing bit between the buttery fish, sweet savory miso and reduction, and sushi roll.\n\nThen, there are long slices of lobster avocado roll draped on top of the fish, creating a unique aesthetic and contributes a lightness to the Asian flavors from the rest of the dish. Also, that bit of rice is just great with the protein.\n\n* HAWAIIAN HALIBUT over grilled mussels in a coconut curry with corn, okra and potatoes is truly a hearty dish. The smokiness from the lightly charred fish, grilled mussels, and vegetable components in the curry goes hand in hand with the super savory, creamy, nutty curry itself. A dish with more weight and body!\n\nYup, I came with high expectations and left with the anticipation to come back soon.\n\nDishes to order next time:\n* Fried Salmon Rolls with spicy mustard sauce\n* Warm Wasabi House Noodles\n* Sea Bass\n\nPARKING\nStreet if you're lucky or a parking lot. \nPortsmouth Square Garage in Chinatown is a 5-minute stroll away.

Brought my wife's friend who was visiting from Korea so that she could enjoy the delectable goodies that they serve up at The House.\n\nIn order to multiply our enjoyment, we had the ingenious idea of sharing all our dishes. Thus we proceeded in devouring each dish one by one.\n\nTo start we had the tuna tartare with nori chips and a half dozen raw oysters. I enjoy trying different types of tartare at the many restaurants that I visit. I must say that The House has one of the best. It's the perfect blend of tangy, spicy, and fresh tuna taste along with the unpretentious chips that melt away easily into the background. The oysters were good, I enjoyed the spicy sauce that accompanied the oysters. It seemed to be their own blend that precluded the need of tobasco or cocktail sauce. Although I think I prefer tobasco.\n\nWe had the sea bass and pork chops again and they were excellent, AGAIN! I just love biting into that sea bass. The sudden charcoal grill taste combined with the seared outer skin and soft inner sea bass is to die for. I don't understand how they cook the fish like this and not dry it out. Tricky tricky asian fusion cooks... :)  The pork chops were soft and inviting and paired well with the pomegranate sauce. I still like the sea bass better and my wifey liked the pork of course. I swear she just likes to choose the opposite of whatever I choose...\n\nSince we had a third person with us we had the opportunity to order a third and NEW dish this time. (The real reason for coming to The House with a third person comes through.) We had the chicken with white truffle oil. The name of this dish does it no justice, neither does the real name on the menu. The chicken is cooked to perfection, nice and juicy on the inside and definitely not dry. The sauces surrounding the chicken were the kicker. This is truly what fusion is about. There was some combination of curry and other sauces that were just absolutely KILLER. None of us could stop eating the chicken, we all wanted the last piece.\n\nAnother great dinner at The House. How can I not give this place 5 stars when I always walk away pleased? The prices are also pretty reasonable for a nice restaurant. We had 3 appetizers, 3 main dishes, and 1 dessert for $120 not including tip. I'd say that's a pretty reasonable price for what we had.", "author": "Tommy B."}

The menu is fairly extensive with lots of yummy-sounding dishes (there were yummy specials that night, too!). The whole feel of the place is super different from the food. The food is a little fancy and so good, but it feels like a dressed-up hole in the wall joint.\n\nThere are steak, seafood, and chicken (but no vegetarian) dishes to choose from. I can be a bit picky in food I like, but there were multiple dishes I would have liked. I ended up getting a mushroom dish that was really tasty.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-01-23", "description": "It was my first time trying \"The House\" and I was with a friend just to treat him out to a nice birthday dinner. The restaurant is rather small and tight. Because it gets so much business, it's packed tight in there. The wait (depending when you come) can be painstakingly long. I believe we arrived at 6PM for dinner, but the wait was roughly 1.5 hours. Honestly, we didn't mind. There's plenty to do in the area to kill time. Walk around the streets of the area and grab a cup of coffee or something.\n\nSERVICE: Once we were seated, our waiter was pleasantly polite and informative of the specials and filled with recommendations for us first-timers. Service was decent. Very polite, courteous, and well-informed. Given that it was a busy time, the servers could not get to us as quick as they possibly could have wanted to. Which is perfectly understandable. \n\nAPPETIZER: Raw Oysters\nIt was my first time trying raw oysters. And for my first time, I fell in love. I think I love eating raw oysters now. The oysters were fresh and did not have that overpowering fishy smell. The sauce with the squirt of lemon on it was utterly delicious. Luckily, my friend did not prefer oysters. More for me! \n\nENTREE: Rib-Eye Steak\nI haven't had steak in a while, so I was pretty excited to finally have some. First off, the plating looked beautiful. It looked like it tasted amazing! The steak was cooked to perfection. I ordered it medium-rare. And it was cooked just the way I wanted. Not too difficult to cut into or chew. Every bite was filled with tender juices and sweet Jesus have mercy... I love meat. Surprisingly wolfed down the whole thing as ladylike as I possibly could. The mashed potatoes that accompanied the dish were pretty good, but obviously did not overpower the taste of the steak.\n\nDRINKS: Tea\nI cannot clearly remember what tea I had ordered, but I believe it was some sort of black tea. It was relatively strong and heavy in taste. Slightly bitter, but I didn't mind. As a tea connoisseur, I've developed a taste for tea and I thought it was quite aromatic. However, probably would prefer it if the taste was a little lighter and not so strong. I would assume most would find it a bit too strong or bitter.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that you are in San Francisco and it is notorious for it's lack of parking spaces. We got ourselves valet parking nearby, so it was no big deal for us. \n\nRegardless of the inevitable horrors of city parking, I highly recommend giving this restaurant a try! The wait is a bit long, but if you've got time, it's worth it. The portions are more-than-enough; maybe even generous. Definitely swing by and try it out!", "author": "Jessica X."}

We started with the Deep Fried Salmon roll and the the calamari. A perfectly seared piece of salmon wrapped in a crispy exterior, the salmon roll was freakin' amazing. The calamari on the other hand was just as good. I ordered the wasabi noodles with steak and my girl friend got the Sea Bass! The wasabi noodles tasted really unique and the steak was cooked just the way I liked it, medium rare.

It's Asian food, sure; and one can proclaim to the high heavens; with the might of Joey Laurence \"WHOA\" once you take your first bite.  The food service and quality was that mind shatteringly-smack_your_cousin-kick_him_in_the-shin-good.  \n\nI dare say, with a place that has over 2000 reviews on Yelp, there has to be something that works.  I took my Seattle taste buds here, and armed with a more than attractive girl to help keep me honest, decided to find \"The House.\"  The d\u00e9cor is simple and homely; the tables and chairs close, everyone her is cozy, without being cramp.  The first detail you might notice after being seated is the little house cutout in the table placement.  If you know the finer details like that are taken care of, you have to expect the food will have a focus on detail.  \n\nLooking at the menu, it's simple, one page of goodness.  They seem to understand that a good kitchen with a focus, should stick with that focus, with only maybe 15 small places, and 10 main items.  We did the following; two small, and two main plates. \n\nSteamed Mussels \nTempura Shrimp on Greens\nSea Bass with Vegetables\nSeared Ahi Tuna. \n\nHere we go... \n\nSteamed Mussels were cooked wonderfully, full of flavor, extremely soft and tender. The sauce was light and just enhanced the texture of these sea found delights.  The Tempura Shrimp was a visual sight, a mountain of greens, with shrimp and avocado.  What makes or breaks a dish like this was the cooking of the shrimp.  It was a delicious lightly fried masterpiece.  The shrimp were tender, and juicy.   The greens balanced it out perfectly.\n\nSea Bass, is an animal that is fatty, full of love fish.  it makes the world feel better; and in this case, it does make the world feel better.  It's blacken, just slightly on the top and bottom, a crust that balances the juicy flesh in the middle.  It was soft, fall apart goodness-that-would-make-you-scream-in-joy-with-new-found-salvation. Yes the clouds parted for this meal.  Mine on this night was Seared Ahi Tuna.  A towering piece with three richly cut pieces of tuna, on the slopes of a rice and vegetable hillside; with rivers of what I recall, a spicy aioli.  The fish superb, the flavor textures were perfect, and if you didn't know it, eyes closed, you might imagine yourself in pure Zen.  \n\nSo \"The House\" proves to be good-amazing-loving-warm-from_the_heart food, but what is that feeling you have when you are done?

I usually hate eating the fat on a steak...but the fat in the steak was so wonderful that the whole steak was devour by me in a matter of minutes.\n\nWELL I also tried the appetizers which was pretty good.

The place is small and a not-so-hidden gem, so you're best served making reservations.\n\nOn both visits, my dining companions and I opted to skip the specials and focus on the regular menu items. The menu consists of an assortment of starters and mains, by sharing we were able to try a nice cross-section of the menu:\n\n*Ahi Tuna Tartare - excellent, one of the most flavorful tuna tartares I've ever eaten\n*Deep fried salmon roll - delicious and the chinese hot mustard will do wonders for any congestion!\n*Maine crab cake - inventive presentation and teeming with crab.

The fish practically melts in your mouth Served with udon noodles and green beans, it's a can't miss dish. Did I say OMFG?\n*Grilled ahi - not as amazing as the sea bass, but still an excellent dish. Generous amounts of ahi are presented over sticky rice and spinach.\n\nWe capped off each dinner with a slice of chocolate cake.

There were a few drawbacks such as the service and noise levels / seating arrangement, but all in all, we had a great experience.\n\nWe started with a beverage (beer and wine), and 2 appetizers:  Scallops in a Ponzu sauce (on special) and the Crab Cake.  We enjoyed both, but were more impressed with the scallops which were prepared perfectly.  The sauce and veg complimented and made them quite delicious.  The crab cake was large and felt like it had a lot of filling (non crab) inside, but it was still tasty, and the sauce was good.\n\nI had the famed Sea Bass with garlic noodles.  The bass was cooked perfectly and was very delicious.  I kind of liked it simply grilled rather than dipping it in the accompanying sauce, but that's just my preference.  The sauce actually tasted great on the noodles and the green beans that came with the bass.  My wife had the mushroom rice with grilled prawns.  She and I both thought this was OK.  \n\nWe waited forever for our 2nd drink, and in fact, had to ask a server who was not our server if we could order a drink after about 10 minutes of sitting there with an empty glass.  Also, in the section in which we sat, the tables were maybe 6 inches apart from each other.  Therefore, it's as if you're dining with the people on either side of you which makes any conversation (if you can hold one given the volume in the restaurant) awkward.

That includes all Michelin star places in San Francisco, LA and Vegas I've dined at. This place's nose is so far up its own ass, a team of Sherlock Holmes and Batman would need a week to find it.\n\nI'm willing to forgive the typical San Francisco-ness of having to make reservations over a month in advance. *But* with the North Beach parking craziness, I was literally 11 minutes late. I called in advance saying I was having parking issues and would be 15 mins late. They said they give up tables after 10 minutes and there was a \"mob\" outside. And we'd probably have to wait the full two hours for a table.\n\nWhen we got to the restaurant, there were 3 people outside. If that counts a mob, these guys probably shit themselves at Bay to Breakers.\n\nFortunately we *were* seated relatively quickly...after an excessively rude waitress snapped at us and told us to wait outside.\n\nFrom the moment we sat down, to the moment we were out the door, we were rushed and made to feel most unwelcome. A waiter wanted to bring out our entrees 5 mins after we'd been served appetizers. This is *after* I already bought a $70 bottle of wine off these people, so it was going to be a good size tab. When I told him to wait for us to finish our appetizers, they looked super offended. Please.\n\nEntrees were brought out the instant I took the last bite of appetizer, and we were rushed through those as well by the staff.\n\nTo be quite honest, the food was average for the price. It was decent, but for a $80 food tab (two apps, two entrees) I would expect adequate food. Total bill was $150, so I'd expect better service considering we're giving them a decent amount of money for two people.\n\nAll in all, this is the *last* place I would come for a nice meal given the abhorrent service. For a special occasion in San Francisco, go to Alexander's, Acquerello, La Folie or Boulevard. The House is just awful from start to finish.", "author": "Rishi G."}

When we first sat down, water, a mini plate of sliced cucumbers with vinegar and sesame seeds, and menus were given out by a tall nice gentleman.  It was pretty dark in there, so it was kind of hard to see the menus.  I don't remember it being that dark, but it was probably because the light was flickering above us.  It was kind of annoying, but I wasn't going to ask them to fix it.  They couldn't have fixed it right then and there because dust would have been everywhere and people would have to move.  I am not that kind of person that would make everybody stop what they're doing just to fix the light.  The flickering of the lights didn't seem to bother other guests, so maybe their eyesight is better than mine. haha lol  The waitress came to our table about 5 minutes later asking if we wanted to hear the specials.  Even though we heard the specials, we were still sticking to the original choices we made (the wasabi noodles and steak).  In addition to our entrees, we ordered the tuna tartare as our appetizer.  As for the drinks, my boyfriend ordered champagne, and I wanted to try something different, so I ordered the Rose (not the sparkling one).  Overall, the champagne and the Rose was ok (nothing too special).  The table next to us was seated 5 minutes later than us, ordered right after us, and had the same waitress as us, but they had their appetizer before us.  I understand that different appetizers have different waiting times.  But it was after they finished eating their appetizer that our waitress came to our table and asked, \"You guys didn't get the appetizer yet, right?  I'll go check.\"  When our appetizer finally came, it came in 3 pieces.  I would have taken a picture of it, but my boyfriend was too hungry and ate it. lol  The tuna tartare dish came with three long triangular chips, each chip having tuna tartare stacked on top of it.  The presentation was really amazing (WELL DONE CHEFS!!), but 3 chips for 2 people (NO CHEFS!! =/)?  I would suggest making 4 small chips, so we each can have 2.  Even though my boyfriend was hungry, he still offered the last chip for me because he knew I love tuna tartare.  Such a nice boyfriend. lol Anyways, after finishing the appetizer, our entrees came.  The wasabi noodles weren't super spicy, just how we love it, and the angus flatiron steak was DELICIOUS!!! (SUPER WELL DONE CHEFS!!)  We wanted the meat to be cooked medium, and it was just perfect.  So much flavor and the portions were just right!  While we were eating our entrees, our waitress asked if everything was ok, and we said yes.  We then realized, we actually didn't even know the name of our waitress; a table that was 2 tables down was asking for her name and that's how we knew. lol  Hearing our waitress' name from 2 tables down, you know that the restaurant is small and you can hear other people's conversation.  When we were done with our entrees, the same woman that poured water for us cleared our tables and asked if we wanted dessert.  We looked at the menus, but we didn't feel like eating dessert.  We decided to look at the other side of the menu to see if anything else was written there, and my boyfriend spotted some green sauce stuff stuck to the back of the menus.  Again, the light was very dark, so we couldn't even see what that stuff was.  Our waitress asked if we wanted any dessert, we said no and wanted the check.  She said ok and collected the dessert menus.  8 minutes later, the check has not come yet.  We had to ask the nice lady who refilled our waters for us to get the check for us and she gave it right away.  I guess our waitress was too busy to give us the check.  It's weird to have 3 different people serve us, but I felt like the nice lady who refilled our water cups and gave us the check was our waitress. lol  \n\nWill I come back?  Probably because the chefs did an oustanding job on our entrees, and because of the service from the nice lady.  I hope our waitress provided great service to her other tables, since we didn't get it. =/", "author": "Diana H."}

After reading hundreds of reviews about wait times, etc, I was amazed at how quickly we were seated, and the fact that half of the restaurant was empty upon arrival.  \n\nWe went for 3 of the starter specials:  Toro Nigiri, Scallops, and Kobe Beef Tartare on Crostini.   FYI, all of the starters we had came in 3's.  So if you're dining w/just 1 other person, you'll have to Ro-Sham-Bo for the 3rd and last piece, or if you're dining w/2 other people, you're fu6ked- because you'll definitely want more than 1 bite of the creative deliciousness that The House gives you.  And the presentation!  The presentation of the food was absolutely beautiful.  The Toro was fresh and fatty.  The Scallops were seasoned with what I think must've been called Hella Slammin Yummy Seasoning Packets.  And the Crostini that the Kobe Beef Tartare was placed on?  Cannnnnnnnn I marry you.\n\nAfter realizing how small (but wonderfully tasting) the starter specials were, we were still hungry.  So we went ahead and ordered the Unagi Avocado Sandwich.  OH. MY. GAH.  It's been repeated in hundreds of reviews on here already.  As simple as the sandwich may sound, it's mouth watering good.  Do NOT doubt me on this one.  Is the Pope Catholic?  What'd I say.\n\nIt's a small spot, but do yourself a favor and make reservations.  They don't have pricing on their online menu, but everything we ordered ranged from $11-14 each.  It's pretty reasonable for a place that serves tasty food prettier than some of the higher end restaurants I've dined at.  I told my friend, if I was ever mad at someone- they could redeem themselves by bringing me an Unagi Avocado Sandwich from The House.  Future boyfriends:  Take note.", "author": "Rho T."}

We called earlier in the day and were told they don't take reservations. We arrived at 545pm and were told it would be 45 minutes before we were seated. We walked to Calzones, had a couple rounds, an hour later, I realized they still had not called my cell phone regarding our table. So I called them. They told me we were next. So we walked back to the restaurant only to find four parties with reservations being seated. I guess they do take them. At 740 pm we still weren't seated and everyone else in my party started to leave. I told the hostess to cross our name and suddenly the table being set was for us. So we got sat 2 hours later. The servers were unorganized as well, we weren't greeted for 10 minutes, them three people approached/pressed for our order. The food arrived quickly and it was very good, exactly \"Asian fusion\" as I would imagine. I enjoyed the grilled squid and the black cod was yummy. \n\nIt is unfortunate that the service ruined our experience.

I don't think I need to say more. For the main course, I got the Chilean Sea Bass. Honestly, the sauce was okay (it tasted like commercial sweet soy sauce with some chili pepper). The sea bass, however, was well-cooked, moist, and was not overly fishy. The garlic noodles on the side was the best part! Very rich in flavor. I kind of wanted the noodles just on its own.  My boyfriend got the duck.  It was cooked well. It also came with some crunchy noodles or something similar and was very presentable.\n\nParking in the area is a. I recommend parking in the Chinatown parking lot (for $3 an hour), which is a block or two away. \n\nAlso, the place was a little cramped.

DON'T FORGET TO MAKE A RESERVATION, especially for dinner..or else you'll be waiting an hour for a table!\n\nAlthough everyone raves about the Sea Bass, which is definitely extremely tender and mouth-melting, I would have to say that my favorite here is the Pork Chop http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-house-san-francisco?select=9J5rzgMkGETaeQstZ-SOFQ#2pv8tcE_eKWvrSXzdTX6pg. It's slightly sweet (pomegranate flavored), but this is the most delicately cooked pork chop I've EVER had in my entire life. And it comes with some really good mashed potatoes and asparagus. :)\n\nAs for appetizer, my favorite so far is the beef tartar (it was a special one time for lunch http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-house-san-francisco?select=9J5rzgMkGETaeQstZ-SOFQ#9J5rzgMkGETaeQstZ-SOFQ).

The crabcake was a good size for two and had some sort of tartar sauce on the bottom.\n\nSeabass - OMG is all I can really say when the sea bass entered my mouth.  It was juicy and good and went well with the garlic ginger soy sauce, which I was a little skeptical at first because I was worried the ginger would be too overpowering.  And the noodles it came with was... well let's say this, thinking about it is making my mouth salivate.  YES, its that good.\n\nSteak - well it tasted a little too fatty for me but maybe I just gotten a bad end of it but my bf enjoyed it.\n\nCreme brulee - This was listed as a Coconut creme brulee with passionfruit puree but I didn't really taste any coconut. The passionfruit puree was really light on top but contrast will with the creme brulee.  I love creme brulee and this was good creme brulee\n\nApple pie - I had a small bite of it and it was actually warm, which is how apple pie should be and it's not the usual pie but it had those crumbs on top.

We sent it back, but they still charged us for it.\n\nThen the food was very disappointing too, and extremely overpriced. The fried salmon roll was bland and greasy, the shiitake salad was ok, I guess, except there was maybe half a shiitake in there, and the rest was just lettuce. The kale salad was good, I'll grant them that. \n\nOn to entrees and our disappointment continued, with a sea bass that was obviously not fresh, just like the side of overcooked mushy noodles that came with it. The sashimi was just ok, but small, and nothing to remember. Overall the best dish was probably the kobe beef and mashed potatoes, except it wasn't kobe beef at all, just regular beef.

The only time we were able to get a reservation Saturday morning for later that night was at 9.  It was late, I was hungry, but it worked out after all.  Was it worth the wait & hassle for parking?  NO!  There's so many good reviews for this place & so many of my Yelp buddies have praised them, but bf & I just thought it was \"okay\" & not worth the trip out.  And mind you I am no way a fusion hater..I love it when it's executed right!\n\nWe ordered:\n*Shrimp & Chinese Chive Dumplings ($9):  They were okay nothing really popped out & I definitely prefer authentic Chinese ones over these.  Kimchi was served on the plate too.\n*Warm Wasabi House Noodles with Flat Iron Steak ($18): Nicely made noodles with a hot but not way too overwhelming wasabi flavor.  Nicely grilled flat iron steak cooked perfectly medium rare (per requested) and topped with cucumbers and more of their rendition of kimchi....so much kimchi!!  Again just okay, not very impressive.  (My dish)\n*Chicken Breast with Roasted Portabella White Truffle Oil Sauce (under $20?):  I love truffles/truffle oil!  I semi-secretly wished to switch with him as this was his dish.  The chicken was cooked nicely as it was moist.  The truffle oil sauce was yummy and the mashed potatoes had a smooth consistency.  \n*(special of the day) Red Velvet Cake ($8):  Not very sweet which could be a good thing but it just fell flat.  I prefer by a longshot That Takes The Cake's red velvet cupcakes over the cake here.\n\nService was pretty attentive and prices are affordable for a fancyish fusion menu.  As others mentioned this place is tiny and you are seated so close to the next table.

It's incredibly moist, buttery, and tender. The texture of the fish is to die for, not very flaky at all and quite meaty. There's a nice grilled char on the sea bass that gives it a nice, subtle smokey flavor and visual appeal. The dipping soy sauce that comes with it is just as wonderful. My friend and I couldn't stop bathing everything we had ordered for dinner in it. \n\nOne thing to keep in mind though, both times I ordered the sea bass, I had the udon noodles to go with it and both times halfway through the meal I kept thinking to myself that it was a tad way too oily for me. Don't get me wrong, the noodles were yumsies but I think next time I'll try the rice instead. \n\nThe service is superb and the atmosphere, pleasant.

It's going to be a great day!!\n\nIt's about 7:20 when we walk in and see a server has seated a party of 3. These people have clearly just walked in, too. After the server has seated that party, he comes over, not to greet us but to stare at us, waiting for us to say something to him. OK. I tell him we have a reservation for 730 which he then looks upset because he clearly messed up and gave away our table. Were we late? No. He quickly walks away, leaving my party confused... do we follow him or is he coming back...? Excuuuuuse me? Hello? Nope. Not coming back. So we walked up to another server (I guess they don't have hosts/hostesses) at the counter and tell them we have a reservation at 730. She too looks a bit distraught seeing that all the tables were taken up and tries to cover up with the usual \"ballpark\" waiting time. We were told 15 min. Hungry and slightly peeved, we had nothing else to do but stand by the door, that opened every two minutes and threatened to hit me every time, and wait. During this time, more people came in to be \"greeted\" by the rude/mute server that clearly hated his job. \n\nTo speed this up, we were seated at 7:45. 25 minutes after we arrived, 15 min after our reservation. I know what you're thinking, \"wow, you can't wait 25 minutes? Other people wait hours!\" The place was filled but not packed out the door. We were the only ones waiting. I made a reservation ahead of time, got there early, our table was still given away before we arrived, and then had to wait an extra 25 minutes after dealing with an awkwardly rude unapologetic server. *grumble*\n\nSO LETS EAT THEN.\n\nThe mussels ($11) seemed like they were picked from the bottom of the barrel and were just babies. aka no meat! Flavors were delicious though, wished we had bread to soak up the sauce.\n\nWasabi Noodles with Flatiron Steak ($18) was pretty good. Cooked perfectly. Some wasabi tickled up my nose.

It came with garlic noodles but tasted more salty than garlicky. Would've preferred rice at that point.\n\n\nOne last complaint. Why is it that our server(s) couldn't fill our waters up to the top? Each time it was filled, it would be either half full or slightly above the half line.

A ginger and garlic soy sauce accompanied the dish and complemented the fish boldly. This was served along side a saucy but delicious udon noodle preparation.  I can't recall the name of my beer, but it was a Japanese IPA that went down smoothly.  The dessert offerings were straightforward.  We decided on the apple pie with vanilla ice cream. No surprises, but delicious nonetheless.", "author": "Dana C."}

We had a shittake mushroom soup with truffle oil, seared toro tuna salad, Chilean sea bass, and a braised pork shoulder.  I loved most of the dishes, especially the two appetizers.  The Chilean sea bass is seared really well, locking in all the flavors of this fish.  The side of green beans and noodles it came with were mediocre though -- kind of like dressed up Chinese food a la P.F. Chang's.  The braised pork shoulder had a piece of crispy skin fried separately and placed on top of the pork meat, which I loved chewing on.  The soy broth it came with was so flavorful that I drank it all up.\n\nThe House has their food presentation down.  Every dish was plated in an artful way.  Lots of people take photos of their food here...so bring your camera if you are one of those people who post instant photos to Facebook everywhere they go.\n\n1 star off: Desserts need more work and creativity.  The chocolate truffle cake just tasted like any frozen chocolate cake -- or a la P.F. Chang's as well.", "author": "Ally W."}

So maybe because I just heard people rave and rave about it, that I felt that my dining experience was so-so. The boyfriend and I came here for a special occasion and after a 2 hour drive, we were super hungry. For a Monday night, the restaurant was still super packed and I saw a line form as we got seated. However, the seating was HORRENDOUS. We sat so close to our neighbors that I could literally reach over and borrow their napkin, if need be. I didn't like how neighbors could hear our conversation and vice versa. \n\nI give the restaurant four stars based on the food. Granted, we were early for our reservations so we got a little buzzed at the place next door. So by the time we ate our food, I was eating solely for the fact that I was drinking on an empty stomach. I didn't even notice that the flat iron steak with wasabi noodles were rare when I ordered it medium. After a few bites I noticed that the beef was too red, but felt bad for asking them to remake it when I already ate almost half. We also ordered the calamari appetizer which had an amazing slaw on it. The slaw was the boyfriend's favorite and he couldn't get enough of it. However, the calamari was so-so. The portions were smaller than I expected and I didn't taste too much flavor to it. The bf ordered the sea bass, which was highly recommended by the family, and it was super tender and the green beans made the dish very bright. Overall, I think we should have switched plates because the sea bass was too boring for him and the wasabi noodles were too heavy and spicy for me. \n\nA big downside was how the servers bend down SUPER low to tell you the specials. The restaurant is soooo filled with close tables that it was hard to hear your server. Not to mention how uncomfortable they look bending down for such a long period of time. And let me tell you, when they tell you their specials it is SUPER LONG. I really REALLY REALLY wished that they wrote down their specials on a small menu because I couldn't hear our server and felt like I would've liked something better on that menu! I didn't want to make her repeat all the specials because I saw that she was in a big hurry to greet other tables. Sad to miss out, but hopefully I will come back and try more dishes!", "author": "Anh Thu P."}

Please make sure you make reservations, its a really small place and you would definitely have to wait otherwise. It was cold outside and people were huddling up next to the small entrance.\n\nOnce we sat down we were greeted with a little plate of pickled cucumbers. Our waitress let us know the specials of the day and got to look over the menu, which doesn't have at on of options but so many things sounded tasty. We had the fried salmon roll and grilled calamari (special) for apps. The calamari was perfect - not over cooked and chewy at all. It came with a tangy tomato sauce. The salmon roll was mostly cooked all the way. It looks like they just diagonally sliced the whole roll so pretty big serving. The sauce was great and so was the cabbage slaw that came with.\n\nI ended up ordering the special which was a miso black cod that came with a California and avocado roll. Again sliced diagonally length wise. The rolls were laid on top of the miso black code which was just so flaky and tender and delish! Below that was some broccoli which I thought was a bit too bitter for me.\n\nOne of my friends had the wasabi noodles with flat iron steak which I had a taste of. The noodles were great! They used udon type noodles (a fav of mine) and it was mixed in a sauce that had a taste of wasabi but not the overpowering spice of it! \n\nYumm all around!

I am pretty sure that restaurants like this one in SF is the reason why Yelp was started.\n\nThis place doesn't look like anything special.  But let me just say that as a Yelp Elite for the past two years and having eaten more than my fair share of awesome meals in my 43 years (so far) on This Planet, I ate one of the best meals (top 10) I have ever eaten.\n\nIt is not big, maybe 15 tables with seating for 40 people.  The wait started at 7pm when we walked by on our way to a bar up the street.  There are going to be people who write bad reviews about this place based on the fact that seating is somewhat chaotic.  Our group of 6 walked in and were seated before a couple who were waiting before us.  This would be understandable except we sat a 4-top with two extra seats on the ends and any other restaurant would have seated a couple at it.\n\nWe started with an appetizer of unagi over wasabi rice - Incredible!  And albacore (tuna) tartar that was the best sushi-grade I have ever tasted.\n\nI had the Sea Bass - the combination of fish, SAUCE on the side, rice noodles and green beans was awesome.  One of the specials was prawns on a mushroom risotto. The steak on noodles was equally good. \n\nDid I mention the amazing service!? Nothing was bad about the meal.

I went here with a friend who I normally eat at 3 star places with.  He chose the restaurant, so I was expecting something 3 stars.  Low expectations = easy to blow away my expectations?\n2. Really cute, sleek wood interior.  Small space.  Feels cozy like a home. \n3.  Each placemat on the table has a tiny house stamp!!  Like a little house is cut into your placemat.  I thought it was really cute.  \n\nOk, onto the more substantive stuff.  We ordered the specials of the day for nearly everything.  The day we went the appetizer special was seared scallops.  WOW!  Really divine scallops.  I don't even know how they cooked them, but they were better than the scallops I had at Spruce ( imagine that!).  When the first bite exceeded what I had tasted at Spruce, I knew that I was in for something spectacular.  At times like this I wish I had gone to culinary school so that I could describe the food better....but I didn't so I can't.  The scallops were amazing though.  \n\nFor the entree, we ordered the 1) Grilled ahi tuna with spicy mustard aioli and 2) Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy.   Both dishes get an A+ for presentation.  \n\nI am terrible with spicy food, so I was a bit nervous about the ahi....it would've been awful if it was too spicy for me to enjoy.  But, the ahi wasn't spicy at all - it just had a lovely mustard aioli flavor to it.  The ahi was served with white rice and some leafy greens (maybe bak choy?) that had been stirred in the fry pan.  The leaves were a bit too salty for my taste, but complimented the ahi nicely since the ahi did not have a lot of flavor on its own.  The ahi quality was excellent.  \n\nThe sea bass just melts in your mouth.  It is served with thick noodles and some greens.  The fish comes with a good garlic gingery dipping sauce....the sauce was great.  I found myself even dipping the ahi in it.  \n\nFor dessert, we got the special of the day.  Peach and nectarine pie with vanilla icecream.  Holy $jsfs.  Move over Marie Callendars!  The pie was served warm....perfect crust thickness, fresh peaches and nectarines, perfect sweetness.  \n\nI was blown away the whole meal.  I really liked that the ambiance wasn't over-the-top fancy (I hate over-the-top fancy), but yet the quality was still very high.

For drinks, I had two glasses of their Sauvignon Blanc and he had two glasses of the Chimay beer. Don't know what Chimay beer is? Don't worry, I googled it for you. It's a Trappist beer. Trappist beer is beer that is brewed in a Trappist Monastery under the control and responsibility of monks. Revenue goes to social service. It's a Belgian beer. I tasted it and thought it was pretty damn delicious! Very easy to drink and got Vincent buzzed after just one hehehe. Our drinks were all $8 each and totally worth it. \n\nWe ordred two appetizers to start. First, we ordered the selected oysters on the half shell with spicy cilantro mignonette. Yes, they were raw. Then, we ordered the deep-fried salmon roll with chinese hot mustard. Your mouth should be watering right about...now!\n\nThe oysters were SO GOOD. I've never had such amazing oysters. They were very fresh and the sauce had a nice kick to it. The deep-fried salmon roll sounded so simple, which it was, but it was also jam packed with flavor! The chinese hot mustard sauce was amazing. I had to drench my salmon roll in it. Both appetizers blew my mind. I think that it is absolutely imperative to use great quantities of both sauces when eating these appetizers because they really take the dishes to another level.\n\nAs for the entrees, we ordered the warm wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak and the grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy. We had the steak cooked medium and it came out perfectly. The steak was tender and delicious. I really liked the wasabi house noodles as well. You could definitely taste that wasabi flavor, but it didn't overpower the dish by any means. There were also some cabbage on the side that were really well seasoned. I don't even really like veggies, but I loved whatever they put on that plate. The sea bass was AMAZING! It was cooked so well. I like sea bass because it's got this buttery flavor to it. That dish also came with some noodles as well as snap peas. The dish also came with a sauce similar to soy sauce, except a little bit thicker. Salty and delicious!\n\nI was so impressed by this place. The food was out of this world and service was great. Even though it was crowded, we were checked on consistently throughout the night.

Inside is really small and you can kind of hear the conversation at the table next to you. \n\nThey offer a lot of different specials for the night there was something for each course and we took advantaged and ordered most of them. \n\nFor an appetizer we ordered the grilled calamari.

The scallops was cooked perfectly and mixed with the orzo pasta it was a nice smooth flavor. Around the outside of the bowl they had some spicy oil so every now and then I will mix it with the bite I was having so it can give it that kick. I took a picture of it but my flash was acting up (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZoZjbOYR-apY8XvommlNUA?select=9ZvjcoppLsKn71mIYrlwtg) \n\nMy cousin got the other special of the night Black Cod with California Rolls. Their rolls are not cut like traditional cut rolls this one cut down the middle leaving you two long pieces of California rolls. In addition they didn't use imitation crab meat but actually crab meat so that was a plus. The fish itself was very moist and the sauce with it accompanied it very well. \n\nMy parents got the popular dishes that The House offers, one the grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy and the Angus rib eye steak, house made teriyaki, toasted garlic better. Both dishes were very good and lived up to the hype they have been getting with these dishes. \n\nFinally we ended up the night by getting the chocolate cream pie and the special Japanese pumpkin cheesecake. Personally, I really enjoyed the Japanese pumpkin cheesecake more, but that may be because I am not a chocolate person. The cheesecake was warm and had a scoop of ice cream on top and the best part is that it wasn't too sweet. \n\nOh and we ordered the Almond cookies to go because we saw some other people ordering it. It wasn't the traditional type of almond cookie this one was more like a butter cookie with a giant kick of almond. I enjoyed being able to take this home and enjoying at my own pace.", "author": "Lisa Z."}

We had reservations for 7pm and called to informed them that we would be a few minutes late. They told us they were only going to hold it for ten minutes max. I'm glad they kept their word unlike many restaurants that give it away regardless and you would still have to wait!\n\nWe were seated right away, by the window. Best seat in my opinion! And quickly read our specials of the day.\n\nWe ordered:\n1) Soft shell crab with spicy soba noodles (their special of the night)\n2) Ahi tuna tartare with roasted nori chips\n3) Warm wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak (my bf swapped for NY steak, DEFINITE MUST!)\n4) Angus ribeye steak, housemade teriyaki, toasted garlic butter\n\n1) Crab was a-ok, however presentation was nice. Spicy soba noodles had a nice balance of sweet/spicy.\n2) MMM, ahi tuna was fresh and tangy! The chips add a nice crunch to the tender fish.\n3) The NY steak just melts in your mouth, the noodles had a strong but not overpowering wasabi taste.\n4) MAN, I LOVED my Angus ribeye steak. I proudly devoured it! Tender, perfect medium rare, topped with crispy basil and garlic. The mash potatoes were such a delight. It was also nicely paired with the gai-lan veggie.\n\nI think one of the reasons that THE HOUSE is so successful is that they have both nice textures and a WOW factor in their flavors. Many restaurants lack one or the other, at times both. PLUS, their portions & prices are awesome!\n\nCheers to The HOUSE! You guys just raised the bar for Asian Fusion!", "author": "Karen L."}

I have never been disappointed with the food here. I have never ordered any of the typical main dishes on the menu... I have always ordered whatever the special was. I recall a skate fish filet with truffle mushroom sauce and roasted vegetables. It looked beautiful and it tasted incredible. Another dish I remember was the grouper. Wow! The fish was so tender and flavorful! \n\nOther dishes I have had the opportunity to nibble on are the pork chop, the soft shell crab with noodles, and the fried salmon roll. Everything I have had here has been exquisitely prepared! So many amazing flavors - so fresh! All of the dishes here are a work of art for the eyes and taste buds to feast on. \n\nThe customer service is rather inconsistent... sometimes it's perfection. Other times it's unfriendly and uninterested. For that reason this review teeters on the edge of 4 starts, but the out of this world food tips the scales in their favor.\n\nIf you are looking for a romantic, quiet, place with an amazing wait staff, you might want to look elsewhere.

My first bite of the meal was the sea bass. It was PERFECTLY cooked, and PERFECTLY seasoned. It melted in my mouth - I thought I was going to die and go to heaven right then and there. The sea bass is complemented with flavorful garlic noodles and tasty green beans.\n\n2) Angus ribeye steak, housemade teriyaki, toasted garlic butter ($25)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZoZjbOYR-apY8XvommlNUA?userid=28FZnuUJi7G9MPdwMCNyVA\nA steak lover's dream. This ribeye is enormous. Every bite is filled with garlic buttery goodness, and it rests atop a bed of seasoned mashed potatoes and kale (?). I loved everything except for the vegetable, which I believe was kale. It was dark and bitter.\n\nService was quite good. They thought we had left behind a credit card, and called us immediately so we could get it. Even though it wasn't one of ours, I appreciated the call. \n\nWhile pricey, the portions were large and I left extremely full and satisfied. I ended up paying $32 after tax & tip. \n\nA few tips:\n1) Maximum 2 credit cards per order, so bring cash if you come in a large party\n2) Parking is incredibly difficult to find, so come early if you want to make your reservation.\n3) There is a no-show fee for reservations, so they will take your credit card # down when you make it.", "author": "Anita C."}

The House was on my radar for a while, and I figured now would be as good as ever.\n\nWe started out with a few appetizers, half dozen oysters, baby octopus salad, and a couple other items.  They're all good, not mind blowing, but they essentially serve as a teaser for the main course.\n\nI wanted the wasabi house noodles, but not the steak that came with it.  They're able to substitute any item on the menu for whatever else you would like from the menu.  I opted to have my noodles served with some mussels on the side.  It turned out to be a perfect companion.\n\nBut oh man, those noodles, I may never get over them.  They were cooked perfectly, and the semi-spicy, ever so slightly sweet sauce was AMAZING.  I tore through those noodles like it was nobody's business.  And the mussels were fresh, didn't have a funky soapy/amonia taste like some restaurants who don't know how to store & treat their mussels.  These were succulent, and served in a sauce that just worked.\n\nThe hostess has the low down on the place, and the wait staff are super friendly and quick to accomodate you, with a smile.\n\nI'd defiinitely recommend it to anyone looking for a super meal in the Chinatown/North Beach area.\n\nIt is a little small inside, and they've tried to install noise cancelling materials on the walls.

The beef was so chewy that I had to spit some pieces out. However, I only did the opposite with the mashed potatoes. \n\nOn a positive note, for apps, I did like the chicken liver salad with its toasty chicken liver crunch. The ahi tuna strips are also always good.

You'll need reservations, even before the restaurant opened at 6:00, there was a line outside.\n\nBefore my ass even grazed my seat our waiter shuffled over and started reading off a lengthy list of specials. It was a bit abrupt and I'm used to at least 1. Sitting down, 2. Being offered a beverage before being expected to focus on my food selection... I get it its a small restaurant and the food is in great demand, so the need to flip tables is tantamount to the waiter's success.\n\nWith that said, the menu was simple, but exciting. We started with the salmon roll dipped in tempura batter and lightly fried, accompanied by a spicy mustard dipping sauce. The texture of the crispy outside and the rawness of the salmon was really interesting and delightful. A perfect starting dish to share.\n\nDespite the lengthy options of specials, the wasabi noodles with marinated steak on the regular menu immediately caught my eye. I wasn't sure I'd be able to handle the spiciness, but was willing to try. I was so happy with my choice, the noodles weren't spicy the way you'd expect wasabi to be, instead there were a variety of other spices that really added a delicious flavor with a mild spiciness that persisted with each bite. The steak, cooked medium rare was the perfect topper. I ate every bite and would definitely go back for the same dish.\n\nMy friend and I were enjoying our second glass of wine and I got the feeling we'd need to order more food just to feel comfortable staying. I hadn't even finished ordering our dessert order and it was already on our table... I swear I have had Starbucks orders take longer to make. \n\nI'd give the food a 4.5, but the service a 3.5. Definitely would go back without hesitation.", "author": "Jess K."}

My biggest gripe is that,  for our party of five,  we were squeezed into a table for four in a very cramped corner.   We had made reservations ahead of time to ensure we got a decent table...oh well.   When I voiced my concern to the staff they just scoffed at me and told me that they can actually fit six people at our table... Six what? I wondered.. Six toddlers??  We ordered drinks appetizers and our main courses all at the same time.   Service was a bit slow to get our drinks since they weren't that busy at the time.   Once the food came though.. It was actually fairly decent... The seabass was divine.. Soft shell crab, salmon roll appetizers were good.   The Pork chops were nice and juicy. Overall the food was good... Space and ambiance,  along with the service was a bit lacking. Not sure if I'll be back..the substandard service ruins the whole experience for me.. ....and it's a fairly pricey place too..", "author": "Marvin D."}

Everything was full of flavor and you can definitely taste each element that they put in the dish. \nThe restaurant is pretty cramped and you can literally eat out of the neighboring table's food and parking took forever to find (we walked like 6 blocks) but overall I think it is worth it to make a trip out here.", "author": "Shirley W."}

Even my vegetarian friend was raving about her curry noodles and her side of asparagus with sesame.\n\nI made sure to order the pork chops and it was so tasty! The soft shell crab with vermicelli noodles appetizer was impressive and the skate with trouffle sauce (\"trouffle\" is magical) made me drool.\n\nStill one of my favorite places!\n\n---------------------------------------------\nYelp you never fail me. \n\nThe food at The House was AMAZING! The rib-eye was the perfect blend of flavors, the yellow tail with chinese broccoli topped with wassabi cream sauce melted in my mouth, and the california roll was made with delicious fresh crabs. The fried salmon roll we ordered for appetizer was addicting (watch out for the hot mustard dip though; just a little dip is enough to fire up your taste buds).\n\nThe restaurant is small and the tables are set almost too close for comfort. Because of the tiny space, the noise level can get pretty high. And you definitely should make a reservation. There was nothing special about the service, but you receive your order pretty timely and everything on the menu sounds so delicious, who cares if the server doesn't know how to smile!\n\nI live in LA but I would readily drive to SF tomorrow to try the pork chops everyone raves about (the five girls at the table next to us all ordered pork chops and left none for me).", "author": "Dawnabelle R."}

We were glared at and then seated.  I understand the House usually takes reservations over walk ins, but does that mean you serve us lunch with your nasty attitude.  It took us 20 minutes to get the waitress' attention.  When she finally came over, I politely asked her what the specials were and she replied, \"Oh, I thought you were ready to order!\"   I was completely stunned.  Am I not paying for this meal?! I was actually quite ready to walk, but since we were on our lunch hour, we went ahead and put in our orders.   The food was okay.  Definitely not as amazing as it used to be.  As the lunch hour wore on, I noticed there were still quite a few empty tables.  \n\nThroughout our meal, I saw the waitress 2 times - put our down in (we waved her down) and for the check (we waved her down)\n\nThere's nothing I dislike more than terrible service.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-01-27", "description": "I've had my fair share of Asian fusion restaurants and The House did not meet my usual high expectations of what Asian fusion food is supposed to taste like.  If I could describe the House's food in 4 words, I'd describe it as: \"expensive 'fancy' Chinese food\". \n\nMy friend and I ordered for appetizers:\nAhi tuna tartare with roasted nori chips\nDeep-fried salmon roll with chinese hot mustard\n\nFor entrees:\nWarm wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak\nGrilled ahi tuna (rare) with spicy mustard aioli\n\nWe had gone with the recommendations as was recommended per yelp, and for the most part, the appetizers were pretty tasty, light, and quite good.  The ahi tuna tartare was cool and crisp and created an interesting conflicting texture with the crunch of the nori chips.  It was an almost surprisingly pleasant place.  The fried salmon roll was basically a piece of salmon wrapped in seaweed and deep-fried.  When I saw \"roll\" I thought it was a deep fried sushi roll, but it was a whole hunk of salmon.  Once again, there was a conflict of textures between the crunch of the deep-fried outer layer with the squishiness of the salmon--which was a surprising but interesting mix.  It was accompanied with a spicy mustard sauce (typical Chinese hot mustard) which gave it a nice kick--so spicy that it cleared my sinuses.\n\nNow onto the entrees, which were not as good as I had hoped.  The food was cooked in an exorbitant amount of the oil, that it felt like my tongue was swimming in a pool of oil.  My chin literally was sopping with oil, and no, I'm not a messy eater.  My pores were exuding the excess oil that I had consumed from my oily entrees.\n\nThe sea bass was soft and tender, but besides that it was DRENCHED in oil.  My cholesterol probably went sky rocket high after eating that sea bass.  I always thought eating fish was supposed to be healthy, but based on this experience, it was not.  Similarly, the sea bass was a little bit on the salty side.  There was some soy sauce that accompanied the sea bass which basically was deemed unusable since the sea bass was already salty.  As a side, the sea bass came with garlic noodles, which was topped off with an extreme number of onions, so that eating these garlic noodles tasted like I was eating onion noodles.  The onion flavor overpowered any taste of garlic in these noodles.  Like the sea bass, the noodles were drenched in oil.  I managed to finish my dish, and at the bottom of my plate...was a pool of oil.  Quite frankly, that is not very pleasing to see.  \n\nMy friend's wasabi house noodles with steak was similarly just as oily and salty.  When he had finished his dish, he was extremely full due to all the oil that caused such a satiating effect.  He had told me his flavors were nothing novel, special, or worth writing home about--and was something he could cook himself.\n\nChinese food is traditionally oily, and the House follows this \"model\"-- oily!  In my opinion, the food here is \"glorified\" Chinese food--just more expensive, smaller portions, and slightly better presentation.  \n\nTalking about other aspects of the restaurant, the service is good--they keep on filling your water and keep on checking on how the food tastes, etc.  However, they had placed us right by the bathroom, as I had predicted, just because my friend and I look young.  A lot of restaurants think that younger people will not tip well, so they will place them right by the bathroom, despite having many other tables available for sitting at that time.\n\nParking can be a nightmare too since parking in down town SF can be horrendous.  But if you come around 6pm, you can park in the metered spaces for free.\n\nOverall, I give the restaurant a *2* star review based on the following reasons::\n- 4* stars for good appetizers and good service\n- minus 2* stars for unhealthy amount of oil and salt used to cook their entrees, lack of novel concepts in their food, difficulty for finding parking, and seating us right adjacent to the bathroom despite having other available tables nearby.\n\nI understand my review might be viewed as a little harsh as compared to what other yelpers have said about this place, but I feel my rating is honest and fair.  I've had my share of Asian/Asian fusion food to know that Asian fusion *typically* is tasty, novel, and healthy -- and the House did not meet my high standards.  I had expected a lot more from this restaurant due to the excellent ratings here on Yelp, but it really didn't cut it.  I truly am not impressed by dousing everything in soy sauce, salt, and oil.  That is *NOT* in any way Asian fusion.", "author": "Matthew L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-06-16", "description": "Haven't found a place in the city where I left with an amazement on how inventive and mind-blowing the food was... until I found The House. Using Yelp, I was on a search for the best Asian-fusion joint (or at least one with the highest Yelp ratings) in the city. Low and behold, with 1,757 reviews and still maintaining a 4 1/2 star rating definitely warranted a visit from my partner and I. After eating here, it definitely hits the mark on the 4 1/2... and I shall explain why....\n\nWe made a reservation over the phone and was surprised to able to snag a table for two for the next day at 7pm. On a Thursday night in the city, I didn't expect this place (with it's small dining area size and popularity) to have one. Nonetheless, we got lucky. Finding the place isn't too hard. Parking is a different story, especially in the middle of the dinner rush on a Thurs night. We circled Columbus, Grant and every alley at least three times for an empty (aka free after 6pm) spot, to no avail. We eventually settled for the North Beach Garage on Vallejo St ($3/hr isn't too shabby). \n\nWalking in, I was surprised as to how small the actual dining space was. By scanning the room, I could see why the fire marshal would have given the eye if more than 35 people (including waiters) had been seated in that space. I was happily surprised to with diversity of the people in the place. I overheard from the group of two couples, seated beside us, in their mid-50s talking about how they found this gem on Yelp. Each new dish that we'd ordered, sharply caught their eyes as they followed the traveling dish onto our table. Immediately they'd talk about the dish and decide whether to order it or not.\n\nThe menu read like a standard asian fusion restaurant with the typical meats: oysters, ahi tuna, shrimp, salmon, steak, prawns, sea bass, ribeye. How it was cooked AND presented was a different story. We  ordered:\n\nH'ordeuvres (from the small plate section):\n\nDeep-fried salmon roll with chinese hot mustard\nBlue lake bean tempura with pickled ginger soy\n\nEntrees: \n\nGrilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy\nMiso-glazed black cod\n\nFrom the starters to the main meals, the presentation was eye-catching and delightfully interesting. I especially loved the fried salmon roll. Crunchy on the outside and so tender on the inside. The flavors were amazing (imagine 4th of July fireworks in your mouth) and had a fine dining type of presentation. The true highlight, however, was the sea bass. My partner had described it so perfectly, \"grilled perfectly like a steak.\" One bite and I knew that it had to be marinated in butter because sea bass CANNOT be that ridiculously juicy and oh so tender in the mouth! \n\nBecause we'd eaten enough fried food that day (and week) to be admitted in the ER for chest pains, we opted out of dessert. All in all, it was a fantastic meal. They would have gotten a 5-star rating, had it not been for their 3-star service. We had to waive for the waitress' attention not once, twice, or three... but FOUR times. And when I got her attention, she replied with the very stern, \"just wait.\" That had cost her at least 5% minus off the gratuity. The service, overall, rivaled that of In-N-Out Burger or another fast food joint. I blame it on the high popularity of the place, coupled with the very limited seating. \n\nWe left with a 10% tip and the total cost was still $86. Anything less than $100 is decently priced in our book. DEFINITELY coming back... as early as tomorrow.", "author": "Carloalexi M."}

To start, we shared the shrimp and chive dumplings, which were good, but not too exciting.  For the main course, I had the halibut and mussels entree.  It was delicious and full of intense flavors and gorgeous colors.  My friend got the sea bass, his go-to dish, and it was great, but, again, not too exciting.  Our third guest had the noodles and steak, also good but nothing special.  Every dish that I saw come out was beautifully presented, and I'm dying to try the special scallops (seems like they have these often), and the ahi tuni with nori chips appetizer.  \n\nThe service was ok - we felt like we had been forgotten about several times and had to hunt down the waitress to request the check - but everyone was nice and the restaurant has a relaxed atmosphere in spite of being so busy.

I'm not trying to be a hater or anything, but I don't think I enjoyed it as much as everyone else does. There's way too much going on with the plate. The fish was sandwiched between an ocean of sauce and a California roll cut at a really sharp angle with two long antennae things sticking out of it. I don't mind fancy plating, but this left me baffled. I wasn't sure how to approach the dish. How do I start eating it? \n\nThe fish itself was cooked well. I personally think the best way to prepare Black Cod is steaming it, but they did a good job pan frying it while keeping the interior soft, rich, and buttery. It's actually pretty hard to overcook Black Cod since it's inherently so oily. However, all the other elements didn't really add to or enhance the fish in any way. It didn't seem like the dish was very focused. The puddle of sauce was a bit excessive and too heavy to compliment the fish. I also couldn't figure out what the California roll was for. Why was it there? I have no idea. I didn't think it paired well with the fish, and it seemed tacked on top for no reason but to look ridiculous. I ended up using the California roll to mop up the sauce, which worked pretty well, but I didn't think they really belong on the same plate as Black Cod. Despite making a nicely cooked fillet of Black Cod, the other distracting components conflicted with the fish.", "author": "Nei N."}

The ribeye steak was tender and juicy, an....d perfect! Every bite was satisfying down to the core! Now I know why people come to fancy places. For the steak! My friend's salmon was pretty good too. I might be biased. How does one transition taste buds from steak to salmon? Don't answer that. I'll just have to come back to find my own answer. \n\nHere's the best part that I had to include in my review. There was this couple in their mid-fifties. They were adorable. We people watched \"them,\" actually more like couple watched them the whole night. The woman was in charge and calling all of the shots while the man was just doing what he was told. I hope my marriage isn't like that. But they were cool because they took our picture and they poured a quarter of their wine when we ran out! WHAAAA!? How sweet.

The food was absolutely delicious and very reasonably priced. I ordered the shrimp and endive dumplings - which were great. The shrimp was fresh and had the right texture, and the flavor was delicious. For an entree I ordered the wasabi noodles with king salmon - it was amazing! My friends also ordered the bean tempura - FYI it's green bean stalks fried - but it's really good and so is the sauce it brings!.", "author": "Cary V."}

That averages out to be once every 1.5 weeks.\n\nWhether I go for something new or stick with the dishes that I love, I never leave this place disappointed. There's never been a dish that I didn't like.  Maybe just thought it was \"okay\" but never a \"meh, never again\".\n\n** Note: THERE ARE ONLY TWO UNPLEASANT/\"MEH\" THINGS I'VE COME ACROSS AT THIS RESTAURANT**\n #1 - They do not give you plain white bread with the mussel dish.  The is SO BOMB that you need bread to pair it with!  I mean, when there's no bread I'll drink the damn sauce, but some bread would be AMAZING.  Well, all they can do for you is put in an \"order\" for bread which is just 4 slithers of garlic bread.  This annoys me because a) they charge for this and b) I want PLAIN bread to taste the amazing sauce damn it!\n\n#2 - I usually go for dinner, but earlier this week I went for lunch.  The waitress had a STINK FACE on the entire time.  No smiles, no manners, just flat out RUDE.  My cousins go all the time for lunch when the are in town from NYC and Shanghai, and they said they've always had her as a waitress and she just never smiles.  I don't really want to call her out, but seriously.. PLEASE PUT ON A SMILE.  Stacy, you're a great waitress, but it sucks that you aren't very friendly and never seem to smile unless you're serving a table of friends.\n\nAnyways, back to the food. Those 2 things are my only complaints...and after some debate, I'm not touching my 5-star review.  Yelp should be focused on the food.. so let's keep it that way.\n\nNew dishes that I've tried...\n\n1. Mussels in shrimp, garlicy sauce - the sauce is SO good.  I'm not a fan of mussels, but the sauce is too good to pass on.  Works out well that the company I'm with love to eat mussels.  They can have the seafood and just give me the bread to dip..-- BRING YOUR OWN BREAD.\n\n2. Grilled Prawns + Mushroom rice/risotto - YUM!  Not usually a huge fan of mushrooms, but this rice was sooooo good. Had a hard time keeping my fork out of the boy's dish.\n\n3. Sea Bass - the noodles weren't so salty this past time, so this dish has grown on me... except I don't LOVE the ginger soy sauce.. would prefer going for the meat or something else.\n\n4. Halibut special - sauce isn't actually very spicy (not that I like spicy) and nothing to write home about. Pass...(unless you LOVE halibut)\n\n5. Sesame Salmon - YUM!  But I'd still prefer meat over fish.  I'll always take an animal with 4 legs over seafood.  The sesame flavor was delish - my tiny little cousin liked this so much so finished the whole damn thing..which is pretty impressive for her.\n\nOkay this review is already too long.  Let me just say this.  I don't give a lot of 5 star reviews..but this place and Chez Maman in Potrero Hlil are currently my 2 favorite restaurants. I never leave either place unsatisfied.", "author": "Melody T."}

This is one of the best meals I've ever had in San Francisco.\n\n1. The location is AWESOME. North Beach is filled with tons of bars and crowds of people who really light up the city. If you don't have a reservation, be ready to wait.In the meantime, you can go to a nearby bar for cheap drinks and the latest game on TV! (wish there were more bars like these in SoCal)\n\n2. The decor of the restaurant is simple, modern, and sultry. It is dimly lit and the walls are accompanied by black/white portraits.\n\n3) Food= BOMB.\n\nFor the appetizer, we ordered the Seared Scallops (which was one of the specials). It was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. The scallops were a bit raw which gave it a nice buttery texture. The flavoring of it (I don't know what it is) was SO good. It melts in your mouth and is paired with little sprouts on top. omgG so good...... they're to die for. Do keep in consideration that this is a pretty upscale restaurant, so you'll only get 3 scallops!\n\nFor my main course, I ordered the Sea Bass with Garlic noodles and Green Beans. Divine as well. The Sea Bass was soft and flaky, cooked to perfection. The Garlic noodles were well-seasoned and full of flavor with chunks of onions and garlic. The green beans had a similar taste as the scallops. It's a blast of flavor, then the flavor slowly simmers away as you enjoy the main ingredient.\n\nMy boyfriend got the Angus Ribeye Steak. He claims it's better than Houston's! I had a few bites of it and boy, it was good. There were toasted garlic (or almond??) pieces on it, making it rich with flavor.\n\n4) Alcohol= delicious. I had the chardonnay while my boyfriend had the red wine (started with an M). My  chardonnay was refreshing, light, and fruity. Definitely, a good pair with my sea bass. Additionally, the red wine had a very soft wood undertone (which I definitely appreciated).\n\nI loved loved this place. I would definitely come back here.

I normally steer clear of Asian fusion, but was excited to try The House because of its reputation, and hey, I live in California now and fusion here is actually a good thing, right?\n\nThe good:\n\n- The amazing fried salmon roll with hot Chinese mustard. They wrap raw salmon up in nori and flash-fry it until the outside is crackling and the inside still meltingly raw, then serve it up with some pickled cabbage and carrots and nasal passage-assaulting mustard sauce. Genius.\n- The rainbow of fresh vegetables that comes on every dish\n- The mashed potatoes\n\nThe not great:\n\n- Maybe my brain's horseradish center was just tapped out after that Chinese mustard, but I found the house wasabi noodles cloying and one-note - surprising to me because I normally love this kind of thing.\n- Shrimp curry noodles were hugely disappointing - watery and not spicy or flavorful, with small, bland shrimp. This dish actually did taste like some sort of dulled Americanized version of a more interesting dish, rather than a new spin on a classic.\n\nThat fantastic salmon roll could bring me back, but after the main courses I couldn't help feeling like fusion had let me down again.", "author": "Cecilia L."}

We were seated at 8:45 for an 8:00 pm reservation. No apologies, just plenty of entitled attitude. And the food was just ok, as was the service. Depressing! \n\nDetails: My boyfriend took me there for my birthday. Our reservation was for 8 pm, and we were pretty close by 7:45. I was worried that we might be a bit late due to downtown/north beach traffic being so unpredictable, so I called to let them know we *might* be no more than 10 mins late. That got me a mean, impolite lecture, the sort you give a second grader for lighting fire to a cat's tail! - basically if we weren't there by 8:15, our table would be given away. \n\nWe were inside the restaurant at 8:02 (yes, 2 mins late!) but it took 10 minutes for the hostess to acknowledge us. There were no apologies for our table not being ready, no indication as to when it would be ready and no updates for close to 30 more minutes.  Folks who walked after us were being seated, which really pissed me off, but we were starving by then and decided to wait. We were finally seated at 8:45, with no apologies. Apparently, the 15 minute limit just applies to the customers, not the restaurant! \n\nThe House used to be my favourite restaurant, but NEVER going there again.", "author": "Sam B."}

The place is little and seemed crowded, so I would definitely make a reservation ahead of time. However, a party of 5 came in after me, and the hostess was kind enough to seat them as long as they would be finished before the reservation at 8pm. Most places would just say no. \n\nI quickly placed my order and waited at the front. Within 5 minutes I had my food and was on my way. She even asked how far I was going to ensure that the food would travel well. Very thoughtful.\n\nI ordered the crab cake and the tempura green beans (I guess I was craving fried foods), and they were both stellar! The crab cake was moist yet crispy, and the sauce had a kick to it. Very nice. The green beans were great. I was hesitant about the sauce at first, but after the first bite the flavors totally made sense together. I love when I am surprised by flavor combos like that!!\n\nBecause I was carrying out I didn't want to get something fancy that would be a better experience there, so I didn't get the amazing sea bass that I saw coming out.

We arrived pretty much right on time.  We were quickly greeted and quickly seated.  This is a small restaurant and the tables are pretty packed in.\n\nOur menus were brought to the table soon after.   Our server came over and covered the specials (one of which they were out of).  \n\nAfter a bit of discussion, we were ready to order.  \n\nStarters:\n\nWe selected the scallops special.\n\nAfter discussion, and some narrowing down, I selected  the fried calamari.\n\nMains:\n\nShe selected the grilled  sea bass with garlic ginger soy.\n\nI selected the Niman ranch pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce.\n\nDessert:\n\nWe selected a chocolate cake with espresso ice cream.   I can not remember the actual name of the dessert.\n\nWe shared all of the food.\n\nScallops - These were very good scallops.  They had just that  slight taste of the sea without having an overbearing flavor.  They were well cooked.  There was no hint of being rubbery.   The greens worked well with the scallops.   The lemon sauce was fresh and bright.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/6dlfdjn\n\nCalamari - This was decent calamari.  I did not think it was outstanding.  Like the scallops, it was not rubbery.  The breading could have used some more flavor.  The small bitter salad served as a side was delicious.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/44hjoqg\n\nSea Bass - This was very good.  It was flaky.  It had just a touch of the flavor of being grilled.   And once again, it had just a nice delicate flavor of the sea. I did not try the sides.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/43wqhsx\n\nPork Chop - This was one amazing pork chop.  It  was succulent and  meaty.  The pomegranate sauce was very good.  Some might think it a touch too sweet but I did not.  The asparagus and whipped potatoes made for nice sides.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/3nrtbkt\n\nChocolate Cake - This was wonderful chocolate dessert.  I enjoyed every bite.   She liked it too.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/6gpue5e\n\nAs usual, we shared a bottle of red.  I get 2/3rds and she gets 1/3.  Lol, she is the driver.  If I recall, this was a bottle of Anderson Valley.\n\nAmbiance - This is a simple, small, and well kept room.  Even with it's small size, it is still a comfortable space full of people enjoying their meals.\n\nService - I would say the service is professional and helpful.   It is not robust or what I would call friendly.  I did not find it rude, just focused.  I think it is a small restaurant and they need to turn tables over quickly.  They focus on precision.  There wasn't a lot of \"are you enjoying your meal?\" or \"can we get something else?\".  But they are there at the key moments and they keep the meal flowing.\n\nOverall - I was impressed.

Holy bujezus, so good. The pomegranate currant porkchop, which I was highly skeptical of since the menu was primarily seafood, was SO moist and flavorful! The currant-pomegranate sauce was tastefully incorporated into the dish - just enough to add to, but not overpower the flavor.\n\nDessert:\nThe truffle cake tasted like every other flourless chocolate cake, cept with really good coffee ice cream. The mango tapioca was like the stuff you get at chinese restaurants, except it was DELICIOUS. \n\nKeep your expectations realistic, the servers are nice and food is fresh, pretty, and tasty.

This time around we ordered everything new!\n\nAppetizers included deep fried salmon roll, ahi tartare, and kobe beef tartare.  Main courses included the kobe beef served with chanterelle and mash special and the black cod in miso sauce special. And for dessert, a cup of coffee and  I believe it was a chocolate torte with coffee ice cream.\n\nThe deep fried salmon roll was not as great as I expected it to be after reading all the reviews.  It just tasted like a wonton eggroll wrapped around slightly cooked salmon and the chinese mustard sauce that accompanied had quite a bit of a kick to it which kind of killed it for us since we had no idea how strong it was and put too much on our first bite.\n\nThe ahi tartare was exceptional, to me at least.  My husband enjoyed the kobe beef tartare more but it was a bit too gourmet for my taste.  I couldn't put my finger on what it was suppose to taste like.  It didn't taste like beef or any other meat for that matter but it was presented beautifully!\n\nMy husbands kobe beef steak was SUPERB. Cooked perfectly at medium rare and so tender.  The chanterelle and mash were also perfect sides with this lovely piece of meat.\n\nMy black cod dish--beyond words--I've never had a better tasting fish.  I took the advice of another reviewer which said to order the cod if it ever was a special and I did and I can't thank them enough!  PLEASE ORDER THE COD!  It was so luscious and really just melted in your mouth.  It was 10 times better than my favorite (or was) seabass dish!\n\nThe chocolate torte was okay.  It was a bit heavy for my taste--think coffee ice cream on top of a thin sliced but very dense brownie.  I think it's because I ate it myself and it really was a dish to be shared but hubby was trying to be good so I was on my own.  He claims his coffee was superb which I'll have to take his word for it since I'm not a coffee connoisseur. \n\nService was excellent as usual.  Our reservation was was for 7:30 and we sat down at 7:32.  Parking is, of course, HELL on Broadway but we always park at the Vallejo parking garage which is just 2-3 blocks away.  The only downside is that they close at 10:00 PM on weeknights so expect to move it before then if you plan to stay on Broadway the whole night.\n\nProven again and again, The House is a must-try San Francisco treat!", "author": "Ivy Z."}

Another perfectly cooked piece of delicious fish that just melted away in your mouth- that's what she said! seriously though I had to ask the waitress what the dark sauce under it was and all she could say was soy and ginger anything else and i'd have to kill you.

The place is small so reservations are definitely required. \n\nWe were shown to a nice table and ordered some house-squeezed lemonade which was thirst quenching. My girlfriend wanted to try their pork belly and crab cakes, but they weren't serving it that day. The menu can change on a daily basis. For starters we tried their Fried Calamari and Salmon Roll. The Calamari was a mix of crispy rings an tentacles paired with cocktail sauce. The calamari tasted good and the breading didn't fall apart. The Salmon Roll was delicious! Salmon wrapped with seaweed wrapped with what I think was the shell of eggrolls and fried. The sauce was amazing. It reminded me of mixing wasabi, ginger and soy sauce when eating sushi. \n\nFor our entrees, my gf ordered the Wasabi Noodles topped with grilled salmon and I ordered the Angus Flatiron Steak with roasted shitake mushroom sauce. The gf described the wasabi noodles as the best noodles she has ever had! The salmon was equally as good, melting away in our mouths dispersing the flavor. The Flatiron steak was a little tough but the flavor quickly made up for it. The whole mix of meat, asparagus, mashed potatoes, radicchio, shitake mushrooms blended well together. The sauce was perfect and didn't overpower all the other flavors. By far the best dish I have had in a long while!\n\nFinal Thoughts: I love this place and can't wait to return to try them out for dinner! I will return to this place many times! The only reason they didn't get all 5 stars is because of the tough meat.", "author": "Anthony P."}

This is a hidden gem for good eats with a refreshing variety of Asian fusion dishes.  Start off with their signature deep-fried salmon skin rolls with hot mustard, fried calamari or scallops.  The unagi avocado sandwich and the wasabi house noodles with tenderly grilled pork is scrumptious.  Whether you have their crispy sea bass, tender kurobuta porkchop with pomegranate currant sauce, or angus ribeye steak with fried garlic bits, you'll be satisfied with what I call fancy comfort food that makes you feel at home without the tendency to critique food.  Normally, I don't drink, but their German riesling is sweet, smooth and uplifting.  Save room for the coconut passionfruit creme brulee with a crispy crust and delicately balanced filling.  The bittersweet chocolate truffle cake topped with ice cream hits the sweet spot for sure.  Everything is cooked just right!\n\nService is friendly, fast, and helpful especially when it comes to suggestions and refills.  Parking is tough on the street, but there are local garages within walking distance.  The ambiance and decor is simple with a contemporary and classic feel in a cozy, small restaurant.  However, the food is cooked with heart with flavors and aromas that fill the room to make you savor every bite =b", "author": "Jenny L."}

I love the crispiness of the exterior and it's perfect with that spicy chinese mustard.  They're definitely not skimping on the salmon either, it's super dense.\n\nA couple of the ladies at the table including myself ordered the warm wasabi noodles with flatiron steak.  A couple minutes later our server came back to tell us that they only have enough flatiron for two orders!  Crisis averted since they were able to sub in some ribeye for the third order.  I really like the colorful vegetable slaw that comes with this dish and the portions are definitely generous.  I wish the noodles were more wasabi-y,  I didn't taste wasabi in them at all.  Someone at our table also had a difficult time cutting through her steak and had to have it re-fired a little bit, which slightly helped.  Someone at the table also ordered the chicken breast dish, which she was happy with.\n\nWhen it came to dessert time we didn't really see anything on the standard menu that we fancied but we wanted to try the bread pudding that was on special for that night.  Three seconds after we ordered it, our server came back to tell us that they had JUST run out..... really? UGH. \n\nService was okay.  It seems like there were only two servers that night and they were running around like crazy.\n\nAt the end of the meal everyone was lamenting about how the last time they had eaten at The House it had been better... oh well.  Maybe I should heed Anthony Bourdain's advice and not eat out on Mondays...", "author": "Kim-van T."}

And I actually had the same dessert I didn't like many years ago, my taste buds probably changed because this time it wasn't as bad as I remember. \nMy Birthday celebration.\nMade reservation one week in advance, because I called restaurant quiet a few times  to get in and they gave me estimated time waiting for a table around an hour and a half two hours. \nSo, make reservation. \nAsk for a table next to the window, doesn't feel so cramped, if you would have been seated in a middle. Place is small. \nFood is as delicious as I remember. \nSalmon roll (salmon wrapped in egg roll wrapper and dip fried) served with mustard sauce.\nSalmon cooked medium, fresh, mustard sauce strong and bit overpowering the taste of salmon, but still delicious. \nWasabi noodle with Flat Iron steak another good dish, steak like butter, soft, juicy, cooked perfectly. Noodles cooked al dente were delicious, but didn't taste wasabi at all. Not a big deal.\nSea Bass with noodles, green beans and soy ginger sauce is another great dish, the only complain the sauce is too strong for light and buttery taste of the Sea Bass. But it did work perfectly with my pork chop, which needed some \"Kick\" which was served with mushed potatoes, asparagus and pomegranate sauce(was too light). Pork chop was cooked medium, juicy and really good. \nService was just okay not personable, but fast and officiant. \nThe dessert.. When I asked the dessert menu, they brought dessert of their choice warm pineapple upside down cake with a Birthday candle. It was just okay. I would definitely order something else. It was a little annoying. I would understand if I wasn't charged for it. \nVery good overall!", "author": "Natasha S."}

Instead they seek out the 1-2 stars to scope out negative aspects. \n\nAnyways, I came here on a saturday night for a dinner date with my girlfriend. With our fancy pants on, we got to the restaurant at 8pm for 8:30 reservations, and were seated immediately. Pretty awesome.\n\n-Instead of bread, they gave us pickled asian cucumbers. I liked it but I think I would have appreciated the bread to sop up the garlic ginger soy sauce mentioned below.\n-The jasmine tea was fragrant and light. Actually, I'm stealing those adjectives from the menu. But they rang true.\n-The deep fried salmon roll with chinese hot mustard was SO GOOD. Mustard was more watery that I expected but it was delicious. It goes straight to your sinuses. The coleslaw was really good too.\n-The wasabi noodles and flat iron steak wasn't as good as I expected. The noodles were a little bland, weren't as spicy as I hoped. It was still better than average though. \n-The grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy noodles were great. I really liked the sauce on the noodles. The fish was flakey and perfectly cooked.\n\nThe funny thing is the food at The House could be seen in an average chinese restaurant. But the execution of the dishes are really well done. So much so that the upscale prices are justified. Two people, one appetizer, one drink, two entrees for around $70 tax and tip included. \n\nOne complaint. The place is so small, it gets so loud. I had to talk over the people sitting at the next table. They should put shag on the walls to absorb the sound. Works in vans and old people's houses. Why not House? Oh and MAKE RESERVATIONS.", "author": "Aron L."}

The place is pretty small but they can probably have a total of 25 customers. There was no line during the entire 1.5 hours we were there. Easy to find seats.\n\nIt was pretty comfy and the atmosphere was nice. The only problem is that the tables were really close to one another. You didn't even have to try to hear the conversation the people sitting next to you are having. \n\nThey have a lot of fish items. I don't really like fish so that limited my options. I ordered the udon with chicken. I thought it was okay. I felt like I could have made it and the soup is pretty oily. My friend ordered the wasabi noodles. I tried some and it was good. You can order it so it is not spicy. I would probably get that if I come again.\n\nThe main waitress looks very bohemian. Another waitress looked pissed off. Only one of the waitress looked happy. Probably make the whole dining experience better if the people who worked there looked more enthusiastic. \n\nWe ordered the chocolate cake for dessert with ice cream on top.

But the fact is there are excellent new American and Asian Fusion places in many big cities--even cow towns like Denver.  So the  place is small and the guy at the door has decent manners and they couldn't fit us in but a few blocks down the street he gave me a call which was cool and way above standard.\n\nThe asparagus was okay in from-a-jar Chinese sauce.  We got the ribs and you'll get  better barbecue ribs at a hog shop in a midwestern town (Montgomery Inn in Cincinnati, say).  And then there was some kobe beef with some sauce on some mushrooms and mashed potatoes with some brown sauce.  A very 1978 Ohio kind of dish.  And we had a fish special and it had some kind of sushi roll thing on it which was weird.

My wife and I really dig the salmon rolls with the spicy miso dipping sauce, which is an amazing blend of umami and bite in one dish. We also had the black cod with a phenomenal sauce and I've had the fresh Yellowtail in a citrus, thai-style broth, and also the Scallops on Orzo. The scallops were delicate and the orzo tasted so much like risotto, we couldn't believe it. No complaints on the food.\n\nService on the other hand, that's why they lose a star! The first time we visited, we made a reservation and despite being there on time (the hostess didn't see us), she went ahead and seated a walk-in before us. We ended up waiting 45-50 mins, and we wanted to try the food so it was fine, but it buts a bit of a damper on the evening. When we sat down we were served water by a waiter who literally looks like he is in pain to be there. I mean, complete grimace on his face, doesn't smile, say hi, nothing. Our waitress was fine, nothing outstanding, but did her job. \n\nThe second time we came for NYE, this time with a reservation again. We were made to wait outside by the owner/hostess in the cold because there were too many people in the tiny corridor by the tables. Again, we were ON TIME, yet made to wait around 15-20 mins, for no reason. I'm fine with making a reservation and them sticking to it, but if that's the case, hold yourself accountable and seat the customer on time. Guess what? We're served by the same waiter, with the SAME grimace on his face. Looks so unhappy to be there and just doesn't muster up a hello or even a smile. Our waitress was quite nice, which was a nice relief. \n\nManagement really needs to re-check it's staff personalities, maybe some ice-breakers or something?

Now, I love spicy things, but one dip into this mustard left me reaching for my lychee iced tea. (Though, lesson not learned, as I kept dipping!)\n\nI then had the black cod with california rolls. This was beyond amazing. I have never had fish this flaky and perfect and melt-in-your-mouth amazing! The sauce that came with the fish was also perfect - a little spicy, a little sweet and a lot delicious.\n\nI would definitely come back here (and possibly order more cod, though I know I should actually try new things).", "author": "Maria G."}

If it's just a small party of 2-4 of picky eaters, I might.\n\nThe House offers pretty solid Asian fusion meal, which is a pretty rare find. Asian fusion dishes are usually over-sauced, deep-fried rice based dumplings with some weird western ingredients like mayo/creamcheese. Fortunately, this wasn't the case here, although some items on the menu might sound skeptical.\n\nSeabass, the most outstanding dish, was fresh, perfectly cooked and seasoned. The scallops were very fresh and not overcooked as well.  My husband really enjoyed his noodles, and yes, he loves and knows his noodles so his approval should be pretty a valid one. So why not likely to come back?\n\nFirst of all, parking was extremely challenging. The restaurant is tucked in the middle of North Beach. If you've been in SF at least 3 times, you would know that on weekends, it is almost impossible to find a parking spot regardless how much you're wiling to pay. All garages were full so we had to park far far away and had to walk through the sketchy areas. So why does the number of people matter? The restaurant is very tiny and loud. Although tables are small, it was very hard to hear each other because of the background noise.\n\nThankfully service was good so overall, I'm giving this place a 4 star review although I hope they'll find a better location with more space soon!", "author": "Effie G."}

Ideale and this place, heaven in food form.\n\nFive Stars\nThe Food. Came here with a few food friends (for my birthday yay) and we all loved the dishes! My preference, from good to awesome.\nSesame Soy Glazed Salmon - I'm a big fan of Salmon, and this dish was cooked well. But maybe because I'm not a big fan of rice, and this dish comes with rice, and the salmon isn't enough to curb a big appetite.\nWarm Wasabi House Noodles - For the price, this thing served up a whole lot of steak. More of a guy-dish, I think, since it comes with a bunch of noodles and steak.\nKurobuta Pork Chop - The presentation on this one is quite the showstopper. Tender and carnivore-rific.\nGrilled Sea Bass - I'm a huge fan of seafood and this sea bass really nailed it. Perfectly flaky and perfectly tender, order it with the noodles and you're in for a treat. Comes with green beans too - that never happens! \nSalmon Roll (appetizer) - This is a great starter! Unique and the perfectly balance of textures.\nGreat ambiance, very cute inside and definitely a must try.\n\nTips\nSave space for dessert!

I'd have to say that of all the dishes, I loved the grilled sea bass the most and it was not even my dish that I ordered out of my party of 5. \n\nDinner reservations are a must if your party is big. I ordered the angus flat iron steak cooked to medium rare set on a bed of wasabi flavored noodles. The steak was delicious but the noodles were too much to finish.  The grilled sea bass is to die for. I didn't know sea bass was such a delicious and silky fish to savor! More please!! \nAnother friend got the pork chop dish and it was good but nothing spectacular. The Halibut on a bed of mussels in a coconut curry sauce was delicious too but if you take a side of rice drenched with the coconut curry sauce with a squeeze of lemon then your mouth is in for a party! The rice was delicious and mouth watering - albeit my palate is always bias to pickled, tangy, and sour flavors.\n\nDesserts looked delicious but I didn't have any room to try.

This time was definitely \"meh\".\n\nWe ordered the deep fried salmon roll and octopus salad to start. The salmon roll was cold. Not even lukewarm. Cold. The octopus salad... maybe had 4 tentacles in it? It was also a bit bland. \n\nFor our entrees, we ordered the wasabi noodles with steak and the pork chop. The noodles were ok, could have used a bit more kick from the wasabi. Steak was cooked pretty well. The pork was cold, completely bland, and had large sections of it that were so charred that they were completely inedible.\n\nWe also ordered a couple glasses of wine. One of the wines was a wine we have had many times before and actually have a bottle of at home. Upon first taste it was sparkling. Obviously corked. When we mentioned to our waitress she got very annoyed and actually argued with us, saying she had the same bottle at home too and that's how it is supposed to taste. I wasn't impressed with her attitude. All she had to do was offer my husband a new glass.\n\nWe decided to skip dessert.\n\nI am really sad because I remember this place being so good, both food and service-wise.

We found a spot 2 blocks up and didn't even have to circle around.\n\nWe started off with scallops as our appetizer, I got the Grilled Sea Bass with Garlic Ginger Soy, my friend got the Kurobuta Pork Chop with Pomegranate Currant Sauce, and we finished off with a Coconut Creme Brulee with Passion fruit Puree.\n\nThe scallops were very good.  Perfectly seared on the outside and still nice and tender inside.  My sea bass was awesome.  I really liked the garlic ginger soy dipping sauce.  And the sweat peas that came with it were nice and crispy.  My friend kept ranting and raving about how good the pork chop was, so I had a bite. And yes...it really was that good.  The pomegranate currant sauce gave the pork a sweet glaze, and it was nice and moist on the inside.  The passion fruit puree on the creme brulee shocked me with its tartness.  But after I got over that, it went quite well with the coconut flavor of the creme brulee.  \n\nOur waitress gave us good service.

I've eaten here once so far and everything I tried was delightfully plated and very tasty.\n\nMost memorable was the moist and flavorful sea bass.  Also the mango tapioca pudding (a must!) it was tasty and sweet without being too sweet, just perfect.  I also had the sliced pork and noodles (garlic or wasabi noodles?) - the pork was tender and moist and the noodles were tasty.  I normally don't like or eat pork meat (except bacon) but I make exceptions now and then when it's well prepared and not gamey.\n\nWe also had a hamachi appetizer and a soup.  I don't remember the names.  They were both delicious.  There were a lot of other items on the menu which I wanted to try so I'll definitely be going back to explore more dishes and also have the mango tapioca pudding again.  I normally share desserts (like on this visit) but the pudding was so good that I will be greedy and get my own bowl next time.  :)\n\nService was brisk and efficient (likely because it was packed) though still friendly and helpful.

Everything on their asian fusion menu looked AMAZING, and I only wish that I could have tried them all!

For entrees we ordered the warm wasabi noodles with angus flatiron steak, and the sea bass with garlic ginger soy (+snow peas & rice).  The noodles were good, but the wasabi flavor was really faint, almost non-existent.  I think that if they hadn't been called wasabi noodles (and therefore expecting wasabi), I would be raving more about the noodles.  The steak flavor complemented the noodles well.  I thought the sea bass was cooked to perfection!  Finally, we paired it all off with a delicious Riesling :)\n\nDespite giving this place five stars, there are a few things to know before you go:\n\n- the place is crowded and the restaurant has a fairly small dining area! Make sure to have reservations before you go, otherwise you will wait for a long time!  Despite having a reservation for 7:30, we were greeted by 3 different servers before being seated with about a 10 minute wait.\n- Street parking is really hard in the area, and it's right on the border of the red light district, so just be aware of your surroundings.  We parked near Embarcadero/Battery and walked over\n\n\nWhat I really liked about the place is how comfortable they make you feel.  It's an upscale restaurant with a lot of suits, but without that super snotty, bougey feeling.  There were casually dressed families sitting next to business-people.  The servers were attentive, and food came out quickly, but I didn't feel rushed at all.

Appetizers were off the charts great -- I'm not even a big fan of asparagus, but this one was great.  And the soft shell crab special appetizer was off the charts --  a spectacular presentation, and it was delicious.  Main courses were equally good -- we had the chicken, and the seared tuna.  All 4 dishes were interesting, complex, presented beautifully....they exceeded my high expectations.  Only the dessert -- a mousse like \"chocolate pot\" -- was average.  And while the food wasn't cheap (dinner for two with a $60 bottle of wine was $130 total plus tip), for food this good I think it's a great value.  \n\nNow for the caveats -- this is not a romantic, spacious restaurant.  It's very small, with the tables very close to each other.  It's not fancy -- the decor is simple, not a dive but not real upscale either.  And this is not a place to linger -- though the place was full, the food came out at lightning speed, even with wine and appetizers and dessert we were in and out in an hour...they clearly want to turn over the tables quickly given the small space, if you're trying to make a show, it's great but some people might feel a little rushed by the pace here.  \n\nPublic parking lot off the alley behind the restaurant was nice.", "author": "Rob C."}

Those dishes should have costed $25 per plate and would have at other SF restaurants, but they were about half that amount.  The salad was fantastic and the dessert capped off the ideal lunch!

As such, I believe The House is one of the better restaurant values in San Francisco.  \n\nWe had the:\n\nTempura Beans - Crispy outside, tender inside (like I like my men) well seasoned with a delicious sauce.  Simple and well executed.  \n\nCrispy Salmon Roles - Again, crispy outside with perfectly cooked mid-rare pacific salmon on the inside.  The hot mustard dipping sauce complemented well.\n\nKubota Pork Chop - Cooked to medium, juicy, and served with a pomegranate and currant sauce. \n\nYellowtail Special - Rare cooked yellowtail that seriously melted in the mouth.

As a tip, everything we had here (minus the yellowtail) was so well seasoned and bold from a flavor standpoint that they would pair well with a more robust wine than typically chosen for dishes made with the same ingredients.  \n\nI'm still surprised that we only spent ~$150 before tip (including a $50 bottle of wine.)\n\nMake a reservation and come a few minutes early.", "author": "C D."}

This place is called The House.  Well of course The House wins... every time.\n\nI don't get the hype at this restaurant with all the 5 star reviews like I don't get why Kanye is such a prick but still have so many followers.  Ok well, at least Kanye can deliver the goods.  Can't deny the lyrical genius in him even though I could care less about the self absorbed person that he is.  House though... I don't get it whatsoever. Is there something wrong with me? Maybe my palate is going through changes? Maybe everything I know about flavor is something like that of color blindness where a color might not be the way as I saw but was something entirely different. While everyone is 5 star trigger happy for this place, I've been here a handful of times, and I have not had a dish that was not way too salty.  At first I thought I was alone as though apocalypse just happened and there is no one to be found... but then it happened.  One after another, and soon a handful of people showed up around me with the same thought about \"The House\". I was not alone. So freakin relieved I'm not crazy.  \n\nThe steamed mussels always seem to have a stench to them. I don't believe it's rocket science but the equation: Mussels + musty death decaying stench = not fresh.  It happens I guess but the smell is so foul I think I'd be able to smell it if I was the chef/cook.  Why would you still serve it?  I stopped ordering those after the 3rd time.  4th time's the charm perhaps? Uh... I'd rather not.  Gambling isn't my forte.  Hey, but if you have been on a hot streak at the blackjack tables over at Lucky Chances Casino, it's probably worth a shot to grab the mussels.  I let the lady at the front of the house know but she insisted that it was fresh so I didn't want to make a fuss on someone's birthday and took it as a loss.  You win some you lose some... wait what am I talking about?  This isn't the casino... I paid for a bad product.  You should gladly take back your smelly mussels.  The House wins.\n\nThe ribeye steak. Salty. I really thought it was from an ocean cow breed of some sort with scaly fins and all, naturally brined from the ocean before it was filleted and prepped for dinner. Maybe it wasn't the steak... maybe it was the teriyaki sauce.  Asian fusion in The House... to eat here you gotta be BALLIN' for the night so you square up n shoot for it... nothing but SOY SAUCE! BOOM! Asian Fusion! I mean can anyone else tell that this spot is Asian fusion with all that soy sauce?  Let's put more just to make sure they know we are Asian fusion up in The HIZZZOOOOUSSSEEE!!!!!!!! (with two arms up n all like a field goal was good)\n\nThe wasabi noodles with flat iron steak.  Ok guys, a quick guessing game... Place your bets... bet on Player or bet on The House.  Everyone done betting? Ok here's the question.  What is the most common ingredient you can think of that goes with wasabi? Besides fish of course.  WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER!!!  I couldn't hear what you said on the other side of my computer but yes you got it!  SOY SAUCE!!! Hahahaha!  Winner!  Too salty.  I mentioned it to the lady and once again got some resistance.  I ended up packing this one to go and remade it at home toning down the brilliant soy sauce effect.\n\nGrilled Sea Bass... take a wild guess folks.  You win... again (in the most unenthusiastic tone of voice).  Grilled Sea Bass in garlic ginger SOY.  Use your imagination on this one.  I'm skipping it.\n\nMy friends loved it.  I told you in the beginning... I don't get it.  They are also friends who tell me how great their dining experience was even if there were cockroaches running around.  As long as they are happy for the birthday party that's all that really matters in my book.  Instead of disrespectfully complaining about everything like Kanye would have at the restaurant and ruining a great birthday outing I get to talk about my experience here on yelp.  While I enjoyed the presence of great friends, the food was just additional to the QT spent with them.\n\nUnless you love soy sauce or salt as much as you love your secret vices...\nIt's a gamble coming here where The House wins every time. \n\n2 stars didn't seem fair so 3 is the best I could do.\n3 stars for service.

I ordered the Angus Rib-eye Steak - thoroughly enjoyed it!  The mashed potatoes were lacking in flavor, but the side sauces helped to kick it up.  All 4 of my fellow diners got the pork chop, which they raved and raved about pre-meal and post-meal, since a few of them had eaten here before.  We also shared the coconut creme brulee.  It wasn't that good; couldn't even taste the coconut.\n\nNow, here's the bad stuff.  When you are seated, they give you a small plate of pickled cucumbers to munch on while you wait.  There were five of us, and they gave us one plate.  We promptly devoured it, and asked if we could have another.  One of the waiters told us it would be an extra dollar.  An extra dollar?  Really?  This is such a simple thing to do.  We look over at a party of 2 next to us, and they also got one plate of the cucumbers.  But we were a party of 5.  Doesn't that constitute 2 plates?  I don't know...really lame on their part.\n\nSecondly, the wait staff here is really bad.  Our waitress couldn't even pour a beer right; she just dumped it in a glass, leaving my friend with more foam than beer in his glass.  I mean, come on.  Her attempt at pouring a bottle of wine was no better...spilled wine on one of the plates, and just wiped it off instead of getting a clean one.\n\nReally good food, but don't expect much from the staff.

We got the big table. \n\nThe OYSTERS never fail. \n\nWe tried one of their special appetizers for the day, it was some kind of kobe beef salad. It was delicious. I believe that was my first time eating beef in my salad. If thats one of the specials on their menu that day, ORDER IT!\n\nMy entree was the sea bass. It came with these fat noodles. Fat noodles over skinny noodles all day any day. I LOVE FAT NOODLES. I think it's because everytime I eat skinny noodles, I eat it so fast (because they're so thin!), that I forget to chew, and then it gets stuck in my chest. And it hurts. So yes I was a happy camper with my fat noodles and sea bass. \n\nAnd while everyone was being super classy with their wine, we ordered a pot of tea! I forgot the name of the tea, so let me check it real quick on their website! ....ok NVM! It's not on the website. But it was the first selection in the tea section. You must try! Tea is good for you.", "author": "Amy X."}

The House is a small restaurant and sitting is tight. The d\u00e9cor' is not memorable but the place is really clean and has a casual feel to it. It is conveniently located in the heart of North Beach and easy to get to by public transportation. \n\nWe ordered a bunch of food to share:\n-       Deep fried salmon roll: 4 stars but watch out for that Wasabi sauce\n-       Wasabi House Noodle: 3 stars, I should have not ordered it because I think it is made with the same sauce base as the sauce for the Fried Salmon Roll\n-       Swordfish in coconut milk curry sauce: 4 stars.  It's yummy but I think a lot of places can replicate this dish\n-       Grilled Sea Bass: 5 stars, I get the hype about this dish. It's a MUST TRY!\n \nWe were so full that I can't really eat any dessert but the desserts looked great and I can't wait to go back.

I was a little scared to eat it because the salmon itself isn't cooked all the way and there's a little bit of pink in the center. It tasted way better than I expected. I'm not a fan of the hot mustard dipping sauce though. But that's just because I hate Chinese hot mustard/horseradish/wasabi. \n\nChipotle Pork Sandwich - this was very flavorful and kinda tasted like korean bbq pork. My only gripe with this dish was the fact that there were some nice chunks of fat that I had to spit out. The salad that accompanies the sandwich was dressed very lightly with a sesame dressing that was really good. \n\nCurry noodles - the few bites that I had from my friend's dish was very tasty. However, eating a whole dish of curry noodles can be overwhelming and you'll get sick of it fast. Definitely a sharing dish just to try.\n\nKorean short rips - omg the marinaded short ribs were so good! Cooked perfectly with potatoes and sauteed green beans. This is definitely a safe dish to try for the unadventurous. \n\nSea Bass - I didn't try the sea bass personally, but everyone else at the table raved about it and said it was the best dish that we ordered at the table. I'm not huge on fish so I didn't try it. The noodles that came with it was VERY good. \n\nMango tapioca - very creamy and not too sweet or rich. I liked this a lot and we scraped the bowl clean\n\nPecan pumpkin pie - eh. I can pass on this one. \n\nOverall, the service was attentive and friendly. I really enjoyed my time here and was glad to try it. I'll definitely be back here again!", "author": "Kathy T."}

The service here is really nice and flexible; we had to adjust our reservations twice for the same night and they were super accommodating. The place was packed for dinner, but our server was really nice and never kept us waiting. \nWe got the scallops with ponzu butter sauce as an appetizer which I loved (probably my favorite part of the meal). My Girlfriend got the steak and wasabi noodles, and the steak was cooked perfectly. Neither of us were a huge fan of the wasabi noodles, but I got the sea bass with noodles and those were very tasty! The noodles are kind of sweet and we both preferred those to the wasabi ones.\nFor dessert, we got the coconut Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e with passion fruit sauce, and it was surprisingly not too sweet and really well balanced.\n\nI probably wouldn't come here again because while everything was good, nothing was spectacular or really stood out, and it is kind of expensive.

Our host and waitress were attentive and friendly.\n\nThe daily specials were a little overwhelming since there were so many options and I wanted to try everything. After mulling over the menu, we eventually ended up choosing the the deep friend salmon rolls, albacore (daily special), and sea bass. I settled for sea bass since a) that's what Yelpers highly suggested and b) because they didn't have the black cod that my friend raved about. I will be back for you next time, black cod. \n\nWhen our orders came, I whipped out my camera to take a photo. The plates were well presented and deserved a picture. The food was combined with the ideal sauces, but I wish the garlic noodles paired with my sea bass were less oily. The portions were plentiful and worth the $$$.

Just give in.  Amazingly good.  Of course, I followed the advice of my most trusted yelpers and went with the grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy.  The worst part of the sea bass was swallowing it, because it meant each unbelievably awesome bite was gone.  It was smooth as butter.  Ugh, I'm going to be thinking sea bass tonight.  Actually, I didn't appreciate the garlic soy as much.  I thought it was unnecessary and just masked the flavor of the fresh fish.  As an aside, it's the same problem I have with putting ketchup on a great burger.  Don't mess with it.  The veggies were also cooked perfectly.  The noodles?  Well, they were fine.  My wife had the Grilled blue fin tuna with spicy mustard aioli.  That was also very good, although it was a little too salty than I would otherwise prefer.  The calamari appetizer was okay.  Admittedly, it was a safe choice and I should have picked something more creative.  Extra points for great presentation.\n\nI wasn't crazy about the lack of elbow room.  Then again, I don't think it's their fault that they have a fairly small place.  It was a little awkward to have a cozy conversation when you have a couple on either side.  Noise level was a little high.  We liked our server, but we were not too happy with the lady who got us our seats.  Whatev, maybe she was having a tough day.\n\nThanks to yelp, I found out about awesome places like these.  Seriously, try the sea bass.", "author": "Angel S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-12-20", "description": "Despite the long wait on a Tuesday night, the food was pretty amazing! I actually had reservations for 7:30pm, but was running late. Tried to call The House multiple times, but no one picked up. Got there at 7:50pm and our table was given to someone else. Thus, we had to wait 45 minutes for a table....\n\n1. Wasabi Noodles with Flatiron Steak\nYummy wasabi noodles! I can eat a bowl of that every day. Don't be turned off by wasabi, because it's not the go-up-your-nose type of wasabi. It was just the right amount of wasabi - not too much that it overwhelmed the other components of the dish, but just enough to bring out the wasabi flavor. I'm pretty sure that someone who doesn't like spicy food will enjoy this dish. As for the steak, it was a bit on the tougher side since I asked for medium well (my fault), so next time, I'll probably go with medium. There were way too many veggies in the dish, and wished it was replaced with more noodles! Priced at $18, it's pretty reasonable!\n\n2. Creme Brulee\nThis was okay.. not great, but not bad. The passion fruit puree and the coconut creme brulee didn't really mesh well with each other. When you take a bite of this, you first encounter the sourness of the passion fruit puree. Then, you taste the bitterness of the caramelized sugar. Lastly, you taste the sweetness of the coconut creme brulee. The sourness really took away from the dessert as it was too much of a contrast to the sweetness. I think it would have been better off without the passion fruit puree, or with another type of puree. \n\nWill definitely come back. I will try to remember to arrive on time for my reservation next time!", "author": "Michelle L."}

Despite their wanting to rush us out, the waitresses were very nice and attentive. Brownie points for the house!\n\nWe tried the black cod and the sea bass, both suggestions from fellow yelpers, and mango tapioca for dessert. The sea bass was tender as everyone has said, but it didn't knock my socks off. The chinese veggies it was served on were very salty, but the avocado sushi rolls that came on top were interesting decoration and provided a nice (blander) flavor to complement the black garlic sauce on the plate. The black cod was the better dish by far, with crispy slightly burnt outer edges and juicy melt-in-your-mouth type meat underneath. It kind of reminded me of a similar dish at Mantra down in downtown palo alto, except the dish at the house was even juicier. If this is a special that is on the menu when you visit, order it!\n\nDessert was mango tapioca, which I actually really liked. The mango sauce on top provided a nice sour flavor to offset the sweetness of the tapioca and the whole thing was light and not too syrupy sweet. Next time I'd like to try the coconut creme brulee with passionfruit puree.\n\nLychee iced teas were delicious too, with free refills that our waitresses kindly supplied whenever our glasses were drained.\n\nOur bill came out to around $70 for two people, not too bad for a delicious meal. Reasons why it didn't get 5 stars: parking was a bit hard to find, the place was small and even though the waitresses didn't rush me, I felt obligated to chew faster, and the sea bass was good but not amazing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-09-25", "description": "I'm usually leery of fusion cuisine because mixing different flavor profiles from different cultures doesn't always work. Fusing needs a chef who is both a skilled technician with a deft hand and an artist with a discerning palate. A few weeks ago at the House, I found such a chef. I had dinner there with 3 friends & almost everything was a winner.\n\nThe restaurant is small, long and narrow. Expect to eavesdrop on other tables' conversations. Also, those conversations combined with a semi-open kitchen & all the hard surfaces made for a very noisy space. Ask to be seated near the big picture window that lets in lots of light. Any further back & it feels cramped & claustrophobic. Tables were set with white paper place mats with a tiny house punched out of the paper. Service was aloof but efficient and unobtrusive. Water glasses were promptly filled without having to flag down wait staff. \n\nOur server gave us some pickled cucumbers to start. The pickles could have been crunchier but they had a good balance of sweet, salty & sour. \n\nAll the appetizers we ordered except one were hits. We had the shrimp/chive dumplings & asparagus with toasted sesame dressing. Both were good, very simple. The kitchen's restraint allowed the freshness of the ingredients to shine through.\n\nThe tempura Blue Lake green beans were absolutely yummy. While other restaurants also have this on their menus, this version was very well done. The batter was light and not greasy at all. The beans were tender but still had snap when you bit into one. The presentation was fun. The beans were arranged on the plate like a log cabin with the ramekin of dipping sauce corralled in the center. \n\nThe uni and steak tartare on toast was my least favorite & I think the only strike of the meal. The base was 4 squares of bread fried in butter. I think the bread was pre-fried and sat around until an app needed to be assembled. This made the bread cold and way too greasy. Half the bread was topped with uni and caviar. The other half was topped with tartare. The tartare had way too much mayo. There were also thin slices of Asian pear to add a bit of sweetness and crunch to the dish. The whole appetizer needed some acid to cut all the fat. \n\nThe entrees were all home runs. The sea bass was the most visually striking. It was an architectual pile of edible wonder. The fish was perfectly cooked with crispy skin and flaky meat. A California roll was sliced in half at an angle and propped up against the fish. Long strips of turnip chips balanced on top like rabbit ears. The dark miso and garlic sauce that pooled on the bottom of the plate had the right amount of salty/sweet. Another entree was the halibut. A different type of fish, leaner than the sea bass but still cooked to perfection. The cream corn orzo & vegetables that came with it embodied summer. \n\nThe Angus flatiron steak came with a mountain of wasabi noodles. The steak was tender. The noodles had that great chewy texture. The heat from the wasabi was negligible in the beginning but gradually built up the more you ate. This dish was addictive. I kept on stealing bites and cleaned off the plate when my friend couldn't finish it. \n\nAnother friend had the mushroom rice with grilled shrimp. It was an Asian version of risotto. It was lush with an earthiness from the mushrooms and truffles. The shaved bonito ribbons on top were fascinating. They were curling & wiggling, reacting to the heat of the rice. It looked like an underwater garden of kelp swaying and undulating with the waves.  \n\nI loved all the desserts. The panna cotta was silky smooth and not rubbery at all. The nectarines and peaches on top were perfectly ripe. The creme brulee had a perfect burnt sugar crust that shattered with a tap of the spoon. Yummmm! The strawberry rhubarb cobbler was good, not too sweet with a pleasing tartness from the rhubarb. The mango tapioca pudding was delicious. I would have liked the bigger tapioca pearls but that's a minor quibble.\n\nAlso another minor quibble, they had what looked to be pen and ink drawings with watercolor on the wall. While very nicely executed, I didn't really like looking at feet and tushies while eating. \n\nThe kitchen staff have mad skills. While not really avant garde, the flavor combinations were skillfully executed. The food was delicious and just about perfect. Another plus, you could taste the quality and freshness of the food. No frozen food and no shortcuts makes for a very happy tummy. A great \"go to\" neighborhood restaurant.", "author": "Cece E."}

We didn't mind because we were not that terribly hungry and of course I expected the wait time. I heard the seafood is good, but I chose the wasabi noodles with steak for the sake of her, since she's not a seafood person. The menu perfectly defines the \"Asian Fusion\" and is all properly done, great selection, very original, very unique. So really if this review was for the food only, I'd give it 5 stars!!\n\nHowever, this place feels like it's perfect for a speed dating game. I don't care much for personal space, but somehow I feel like a cattle cow sitting here. Yes, the restaurant is small because they want to keep the exclusivity going. However, trying to crowd that many people in one small room is not cute at all, unless maybe it's your first date and you are scared your date may be a wierdo. Lol. \n\nSo a 3 course meal comes up to ~$80, so expensive, yeah, but not to the moon. Their service is very upbeat, they are all hardworkers and positive in manners, lively in personality. A++ for their outstanding service and efficiency. I might come back here another time, if I'm in the right mood for it.

The House has all the little details figured out, so you'll definitely enjoy your experience here. The space is really small, so don't bring a large group of friends here. The service was super fast--each dish was quickly proceeded by the next. I think this place definitely tops the list of places to bring a date -- cozy, intimate, but not pretentious (unless you were going for that?). Be sure to make a reservation because I saw someone get turned away at 6:30pm on a Sunday night.\n\nOnto the food: it was amazing! We ordered the lychee iced tea (they actually refilled it!), raw oysters, tempura soft-shell crab (see picture), the sea bass, and the special (black cod). Our appetizers came with the same sauce--an amazing blend of vinegar, garlic, cilantro, and siracha. It was great for dipping the soft-shell crab in as well as slurping together with the oysters. Even though I'm typically a spicy food eater, the spicy vinaigrette had me gasping for air!\n\nAs for the entrees, I had the sea bass while the boyfriend had the black cod special. Both fishes tasted fresh and silky and the accompanying sauces didn't overpower the fish. My dish came with Shanghai style noodles as well as string beans. I really enjoyed the noodles as they were well made and not greasy tasting. \n\nOverall, a great night out. The setting of The House made me feel like I was on a third date (even though I've been with the BF for nearly 3 years). In total, our dinner came out to around $100 (tax + tip).

The place was packed and we had arrived on time for our 7:30pm reservation yet we still had to wait another fifteen minutes to get a table. The interior is tight with dim lighting, a bit like a sardine can. The staff has to squeeze through the madness to provide their hospitality.\n\nBut as soon as we got a table our waitress somehow managed to list off the many specials of the day from memory. The specials and menu sounded unique and tasty. For appetizers we ordered the beef tartare, mussels, and tempura fried soft shell crab. The soft shell crab was predictably delicious although it's adorned with these very long bread sticks that come out of its body like petrified dreadlocks. The beef tartare could have been anything although it was still tasty. While the mussels were good the broth was absurdly rewarding. Good thing nobody at my table was interested in it because I slurped it all down with my trusty mussel shell.\n\nI had ordered the pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce served over mashed potatoes and vegetables. Whenever there are pork chops on a menu I get them. The House certainly delivered. It was so friggin' good. The currant sauce isn't too sweet but it's robust and savory enough to elevate the juicy pork chop. I had a hell of a time cleaning the bone.\n\nI tried a couple of bites from my party's dishes and they all tasted good. I remember the wasabi noodles being tasty. All the meat was properly cooked. For dessert we were thinking of saving ourselves for a spot later in the evening so we only ordered the tapioca pudding. It was delectable. The consistency is a bit runny yet this makes it refreshing and not too heavy. In hindsight I wish we had just had dessert here.\n\n____\n\nIf you can get past the London Underground interior with bombastic noise level, you'll be eating some tasty tasty food.

As recommended by other yelpers, I made the reservation, Monday May 7 at 8:00 p.m.  \n\nSeating:\nNo one at the door to greet us.  I assumed this was normal here.  A server came by and asked to wait while table became available.  I waited a year to experience the House so had no problem waiting little longer.  Server gave our table to another patron who came after us, made us wait 20 minutes, and then presented two tables which was available the whole time we were waiting.  No apologies, just sat us, like this is the normal presentation at the House.\n\nFood:\nI came here for food after all so I decided to let it go and try to enjoy the food aspect of it.\nHad hamachi (?) appetizer, it was blend.  I had skirt steak and my husband had the sea bass.  Honestly, it was not that great.  I really wanted to like it but the steak was tough and the noodle had no flavor.  I tried the sea bass, cooked perfectly, but again no flavor.  \n\nService:\nOur server, same woman who gave our table away, had absolutely no personality nor sense of service.  To make matters even worse, she dropped used oily fork on my husband's shirt.  I almost never care about services when I eat out but this woman just made me want to leave this place as fast as possible.\n\nI soooo wanted to like this place......", "author": "S B."}

I met up for dinner with a friend and her boyfriend from a year abroad after college. Silly me coming from Dallas and assuming that last minute reservations were easy to get in SF, if even necessary at all. We had a 9:30 dinner seating on a Friday night and only had about a 5 minute wait upon arrival. Started with one of the cold sakes on the menu (right around $40) and some Singha beers for the classy combo of Sake bombs and shots versus sipping our slightly pricey Sake.\n\nHITS:\n\nDeep fried Salmon Roll - this is one of the best appetizers I've had in awhile. Salmon was still perfectly raw yet not fishy but with a warm crispy outer layer. Truly delicious. Our group bypassed the niceties (no, you have the last one... no....heh..nervous laughter because I want it...you) and rock paper scissored for the final tantalizing piece like children.\n\nBoyfriend's Kobe Beef Steak with mashed potats was TO DIE for. I ate maybe more than half.\n\nBY NO MEANS A MISS, BUT NOT QUITE A HIT:\n\nMussels - not bad, I'm just a mussels freak and have had a lot better at many other places. Yes, even in Dallas not by the bay.\n\nSea Bass - I hope I'm not crucified for this. The Sea Bass was decent and certainly a plentiful portion (I should have split it with my friend who got the same), but I think I was expecting heaven in my mouth. I actually preferred the noodles and the green beans (which were scrumptious) to the sea bass, and trust me I love fish.\n\nIf we just would have had the fried salmon roll app and the Kobe beef special - which would definitely have been enough to split between two (what I'm saying is do this if you are on a date or just have a party of two :) this would have been a 5 start experience. We had SO much of the seabass meals leftover that we tried to take with us, but were going on to a bar next and ended up having to leave our extras on a stoop and hoping a kind hobo would wander into our bag. Nonetheless, still really great I just selfishly prefer to hope for 5 stars for a $150 pre tip meal.", "author": "Merlinda I."}

The salmon rolls were delicious and my favorite out of the appetizers that we ordered. The center is still slightly raw so it doesn't have that overcooked salmon flavor. The outside is crispy and the sauce is pleasantly tingly with wasabi. The ahi tartare however was fresh but forgettable and served in a tiny portion. The asparagus appetizer was light and crunchy. Everything was perfectly seasoned with an Asian flair.\n\nFor my entree I went with the kobe special of the day which was friggin AMAZING. I'm still not over it and it's been practically a month now. The beef was thinly sliced and cooked perfectly medium. It was topped with mushrooms and cherry tomatoes on a bed of cauliflower and mashed potatoes. The cauliflower soaked up the amazing sauce and was surprisingly a huge highlight of the dish. I also tried my friend's sea bass which was flaky and buttery and came with a tangy sauce. But I'm more of a turf than surf person so the kobe still wins in my eyes.\n\nThe portions are perfectly filling. The litchi iced tea was quite refreshing as well. The tea comes unsweetened and though they give you sugar on the side it's really not needed. \n\nI can't wait to come back!", "author": "Jacqueline C."}

We ordered something random, and it was good, but I never got to enjoy it, because again, the plates were taken away as soon as I took my last bite. The bill was immediately \"plopped\" on the table, followed up with an obviously fake, \"whenever you're ready.\" Well, my mom wanted to finish her pot of tea, and the five of us were all talking, ya know, basic dinner conversation. There were two dirty spoons left over from our dessert at the far end of the table. The waitress made a point to reach over (no regard that she's interrupting) and snatch the spoons and take them to the kitchen as if she was disgusted that we were there for (heaven forbid) an hour. Oh and while she took the spoons, she made a point to open the check the bill, and ask if it was ready. I thought you said \"whenever you're ready?\" \n\nWell, we had 5 people in our party.

And I was not disappointed. The udon noodles had a fab tooth feel and were spicy without overwhelming the rest of the flavors on the plate; the steak was perfectly cook and tender as could be. \n\nMy only regret about the meal was that while the space and service were fine, there was nothing particularly spectacular or special about either.\n\nIf only someone would bring this style of cooking to Paris where I'm based!", "author": "Zeva B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-05-06", "description": "It's always good to be observant when trying out fusion cuisine. My friends visiting from the East Coast had really positive things to say about this place, so after a day of exploring in the city, we made our way over. I heard beforehand our friends had placed a reservation for a party 8 (us) since this place gets crowded really quickly. To my surprise, we only waited for 20 minutes before being seated. \n\nA first impression of the decor: small, cozy, and definitely intimate. Great for large parties or for a date night. It's got a rustic yet modern twist on the inside. \n\nOn to the food:\n\nOur group ordered two appetizers: the salmon roll and squid salad. Both were amazing, although my favorite hands down was the salmon roll because it was essentially deep-fried sushi-like rolls with really tender salmon, served with this amazing wasabi. On a side note, our friend's aunt was friends with the owner, so we got a free appetizer on the house. Can't beat service like that :)\n\nFor the main dish, all my friends ordered the steak served over wasabi house noodles, but I went a little adventurous and ordered the pork chop served with pomegranate sauce. DEFINITELY had some sort of food-gasm when I ate it. I think this place is also known for their sea bass dish, but I would skip that to get the pork chop. Portion sizes are definitely okay for the price they charge you. \n\nDesserts: They have a kick ass chocolate lava cake and an assortment of house-brewed teas to help you digest. Pretty standard.\n\nAll in all, for everything I ate (3 appetizers, 1 entree, dessert and tea) I only dropped 35 bucks. Pretty worth it for a once-in-a-while foodie excursion :)\n\nTip? Get the pork chop dish and make sure to make reservations well in advance. You won't be disappointed. It's a good place for Asian fusion.", "author": "Samuel H."}

Yes, the food is  more tasty and more innovative than your order by number Chinese restaurant down the block.  Yes, the presentation is nice and individualized unlike family-sized troughs elsewhere.  Yes, the desserts are much better than orange slices secretly sweetened with sugar water.  So compared to traditional Asian restaurants I can see the allure, but compared to all restaurants in San Francisco I don't see it being THAT outstanding for all this buzz.\n\nPickles: Sure beats deli pickles!  Little slices of pickled cucumbers with sesame seed ground on top.  Had that subtle vinegar taste that is common in Korean pickles.\n\nDeep Fried Salmon Roll with Chinese Hot Mustard:  Take raw sashimi grade salmon, wrap it in a spring roll then deep fry it!  Hmm!  Loved how there were varying degrees of doneness with the center being raw.  The crispy dough gave a good crunch texture.  The mustard dipping sauce was like Chinese mustard + soy sauce + some other stuff, a nice departure from what comes in those little plastic packets.\n\nCaesar Salad with Crispy Scallops: Tiny seared scallops and romaine lettuce.  No croutons, maybe the mini scallops were supposed to replace them?  Also, not very generous with the cheese (...if there was any).  Probably the least satisfying dish here for me.\n\nScallops: Much larger scallops than the ones in the Caesar salad.  Perfectly cooked with a seared exterior and flan like interior.  The sauce it was floating in was perfect.\n\nKurobuta Pork Chop with Pomegranate Currant Sauce: Tender pork chop with such a nice tangy sauce.  A few simple vegetables underneath, that would be quite boring if not for the sauce.  There was some deep fried root chip (taro?) that was tasty too.\n\nMahi Mahi with PEI Mussels: Sadly there were only three mussels, which is quite a change from those huge vats at Belgian places.  The star, the mahi mahi, was plentiful and did a great job absorbing flavor from the broth base.  I'm normally not a huge fish fan because fillets can tend towards bland, but I sure scarfed this one up by the spoonful with the amazing broth! \n\nGarlic Noodles: We tried to get a side of wasabi house noodles since a friend of ours doesn't eat beef (for religious reasons, not for stupid self-important diet preference reasons) so the steak was out.  We were politely, but firmly denied, but were offered this off-the-menu option.  Huge udon noodles stir fried with some garlic.  Tasty, but not as out of control garlicky as a Filipino version.\n\nJapanese Pumpkin Pie with Macadamia Nuts: Macadamia nuts in the pumpkin pie, why hadn't I thought of this?  Loved the crunch in the creamy pie.  Two awesome ingredients making one great dessert.\n\nCoconut Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e with Passionfruit Puree: Not overly coconutty.  Passionfruit is always appreciated in my book, though I think this came from concentrate rather than fresh out of the fruit.  A perfect way to Asianify a Western favorite.", "author": "Adam B."}

For the slightly high prices and delicious food, the interior is slightly understated and plain, which is surprising, but not a bad thing. It's simple and clean inside, without any distracting or frou frou decor having to compensate for anything. They don't try to be stupidly trendy, which is refreshing. (Also it's a little dimmed, probably to give tables some more privacy because tables are pretty close).\n\nWhen I went with my bf, we ordered:\n\n- The octopus salad with pork rinds. So yummy. A bit pricey for a small salad appetizer ($10), but I was really surprised at how soft and actually chewable the octopus was. The pork rinds were tasty too, without being tooo greasy and gave the salad a nice crunch. It was light and fresh and perfect if you want a light but savory app.\n\n- The black cod. The fish itself was just perfect, definitely the best fish dish I've ever had, anywhere. The sauces went really well with it and it practically melted in my mouth every time I had a bite of it. It came with two long pieces of california rolls on top which wasn't anything spectacular, but I loved it anyway. The greens that came under the piece of fish was good, but nothing amazing, it's something my mom can whip up at home in 5 min. But the main star of the dish, the cod, was amazing.\n\n- The grilled sea bass. It was a meatier fish, but still really yummy can came with a sort of soy-saucey dip. I don't think that this dish was as good, because the sides were just green beans and some asian noodles that are pretty mundane and unoriginal. Tasty, but not groundbreaking. \n\n- Coconut creme brulee. This was awesome. :D I love creme brulee in general AND coconut. But if you don't like coconut, the flavor is really, really subtle. It also came with passionfruit puree on top, which made some bites sort of tangy and delicious. :))\n\n\nFavorite things:\n- The food.\n- The service. This server came by with the water jug literally as I was just taking the last sip as if he'd been waiting and watching for me to finish. o.O I also had this lychee black tea and I had drunken half way, and there was a moment when I looked back at it AND IT WAS REFILLED. I did not even notice. I asked my bf, \"did you see that?\" and he didn't know what I was talking about. Phantom waiters? Servers are really friendly and eager to repeat specials, and make recommendations. This guy recommended me a great wine that I had to write down the name of. :)\n\nNot so awesome things:\n- The price. I love the food, but it was just too painful to pay 20+ for an entree that was tasty, but had more more mediocre sides.\n- The parking. Yeah.\n- Possible waits. Make reservations ahead of time. The service is going to be better around non-busy times. Make reservations for earlier, like around 6pm or so. It gets pretty crowded around 7 or 8.", "author": "Susie Z."}

Our group of 6 people ate here around noon and it was still mellow, with a couple tables open.  But as soon as it hit 12:45-1pm, the place was packed and people were waiting.\n\nI tried 3 things: 1. Fried calamari, 2. Deep fried salmon rolls with Chinese hot mustard, 3. Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy.  For #3, I had to go against my nature and get this purely based on Yelpers' recommendations.  I wanted the Unagi Avocado Sandwich SO BAD!  And in many ways, I still regret my decision.  The reason being that I've had really amazing sea bass before so the silkiness of the fish wasn't a surprise, it was a requirement.   Along with that, there was some stir fried udon and Chinese green beans and the type they used was something I rarely eat at restaurants and more at home.  That gave me some comfort.  And with your typical fusion dish, there's always a lot of sweet glaze/sauce but at least this was on the side.\n\nThe one thing that I liked was the Chinese hot mustard that came with the salmon rolls.  This tasted slightly different from the kind you get at dim sum restaurants but I liked their interpretation.  The salmon wasn't so bad either - everyone enjoyed this.  The calamari, well, is calamari.\n\nYou should really come here to see the hostess - she looks disheveled in that apathetic, secretively hippy way.

The shrimp dumplings was my least favorite appetizer because they just tasted like any other dumplings.  Yes, it was good but there is really nothing special about it that you can't find elsewhere.\n\nOur entrees included the sea bass and miso cod.  The sea bass was definitely the better of the two.  Flavor-wise, it was pretty simple, but what made it stood out was how it was cooked perfectly.  The accompaniments, however, were less than impressive.  The chinese green beans and garlic noodles were overdressed with soy sauce/oyster sauce.  It was heavy, greasy, and really just a bad attempt at asian fusion.  The miso cod was super soft and moist, but that entire dish was ruined by the soy/miso sauce that it came with.  The cod sat on top of cauliflower that was completely drowned in this sauce.  It was difficult to eat because the sauce was just too overwhelming.\n\nI really hate it when asian dishes are drowned in a teriyaki-ish sauce.

I had actually came on an earlier flight and thought that we would stop here on the way.  They originally told us it would be an hour wait at 8:30 without reservations, it was really more of a 1 3/4 hour wait.  And I don't think it mattered too much if you had reservations because a couple in front of us had reservations at 9, and weren't really seated until 9:45.  Parking isn't easy; we had to park in one of those parking lots, and a lot of them seem to charge outrageous prices.  \n\nFinally it was our turn to sit down in this rather small and crowded claustrophobic restaurant.  We ordered their sashimi special and the pig skin octopus salad.  The salad was nice, the sashimi wasn't anything special.  My boyfriend got the flat iron steak on wasabi flavored noodles.  He didn't really like it at all.  I got their halibut on a creamy sauce.  The fish felt a little on the dry side and it came with this mash potato side which was good in itself, but really did not go with the fish.  And the sauce made it too heavy and rich, which only brought down the fish even further.  So the food was rather disappointing.  Especially for the hype and the wait.  I wish I'd known.  I think I would've rather tried one of the pizza or burger places around that area.  I would've saved 3 hours and quite a bit of money and probably enjoyed the food more than what I experienced.  \n\nIt's okay.  It's nothing wonderful, nothing to rave about, and nothing to wait in line for.

Love the small atmosphere and the cozy feeling to this place.  Only warning is do make reservation and come early.  Without reservation, don't bother showing up.", "author": "Yi N."}

Simple ambience in an intimate layout (tables are quite close together) our table of four was seated promptly.\n\nWe started with steamed mussels with garlic infused shrimp, deep fried salmon roll with Chinese hot mustard and baby octopus with pig skin salad. Each dish was delicately flavoured and beautifully presented - I would ask for bread with the mussels to make the most of the broth. Personally, the salad was a little too pungent (or strongly flavored) for me but the rest of the group enjoyed it.\n\nHaving heard the sea bass was a signature dish I was slightly disappointed with The House concept of grilled sea bass with garlic ginger sauce - it was no better or worse than I've tasted elsewhere I was expecting a twist or a surprise with my bites but nothing. The sauce tasted slightly burnt rather than leaving a silky taste. The pork chop with pomegranate sauce was a colorful in taste and appearance, a fresh combination and worth a try if you're feeling adventurous. The warm house noodles with flatiron steak arrived with perfectly cooked steak, beautiful crunchy salad served with garlic noodles.\n\nBest thing about having dinner with a group? You get to try a good selection of desserts! Mango tapioca, coconut and passion fruit creme brul\u00e9, chocolate truffle cake with vanilla ice cream - the mango tapioca reminded me a little of a lighter creamed rice pudding presented with a pretty mango jus flower, light and pleasantly scented. My friends loved the rich truffle cake and ice cream but the cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9 - booooo. Sorely disappointed. Burnt not caramelised. Mousse-like not dense. We did have to send it back but a thank you to the staff for taking it off the bill, they explained it was not cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9 as we know it but The House creation of the classic. Not for moi.\n\nOverall, a charming place, pleasing food for the eyes and the stomach. Oh, and your paper place mat has a tiny cut out house, very cool.", "author": "Sahara B."}

On the recent trip to SF we called to make a reservation for dinner at this new place. We got a 8:30 pm reservation on Fri Oct. 19 and went there at 8:20pm. The place was packed. After waiting for few minutes at the door, a woman came to us and we told about our reservation at 8:30pm. We gave her our phone number and she said that our reservation was at 9:30pm. I didn't  think it was 9:30pm since \"nine\" and \"eight\" pronunciations do not sound close. I ask if she remembered if I made the reservation in the morning or afternoon. She said that she couldn't remember while being very sully and didn't even offer an apology. Hmm... I said to myself: \"Is today the Halloween?\". So we left and went to another restaurant nearby rather than waiting for  an hour.\n\nI think they took our reservation just as bogus and definitely lied to us when the place was full. That is a really dishonest practice. We are aware of the good foods. But for us having good foods without good services is like meeting somebody who is pretty outside but ugly inside. So shame on you The House. The management should take a closer look at your staff.

Definitely a plus. \n\nI'm usually not sure how I feel about Asian fusion foods, and that's how I feel about The House as well. Perhaps my friend hyped it up too much, or perhaps we didn't order the sea bass, which was the most popular dish (sorry, had too much good fish in Hong Kong). We did try the deep fried salmon rolls, which were pretty much salmon egg rolls. Too fried in my opinion, and salmon was ok. \n\nMy favorite was the flank steak atop a bed of wasabi noodles. Sounded like a sinus-clearing entree to me, but was surprisingly not too overwhelming. Noodles could have been a bit more al dente, but were flavorful with a small kick of wasabi in each bite.

I would say the entire place could probably seat around 50 people - it's small, but not a hole in the wall.\n\nAt the recommendation of all the reviews, we order the pork chop and  the sea bass. Both were very satisfying, but different, and therefore need equal attention. \n- The sea bass was soft, almost like it was steamed, but crispy on the outside from the grill. It was accompanied by garlic noodles, which I didn't not find very interesting, but still the overall dish was inspiring. (~$26)\n\n- The pork chop was accompanied by a pomegranate sauce, fried taro/yam chips that towered over the mash potatoes, and a few pieces of asparagus. I enjoyed all of it to the bone. (~$22)\n\nEven though I did sneak off 1/4 of my bf's sea bass, I think I enjoyed the pork chop more because it really isn't too hard to cook soft fish. It's all about timing and steaming.

They are served in a tempura batter over blanched thinly sliced beats with a fish/soy dipping sauce.  The string beans were very big and pre-blanched before they were quick fried in tempura batter.  The texture grean been was crunchy and fresh.  \n\nBlack Cod which reminded me of an asian fusion version of fish and chips without the chips.  The Cod was extremely moist and very tasty.  Dipping sauce was vinagear, soy, fish sauce, and ginger based.\n\nGrilled Sea Bass.  One of the best Sea Bass's I have ever had.  Extremely moist with an excellent texture.  Came with a side of noodles.  Excellent dish!\n\nWasabi Noodles and Pork.  My favorite of them all.  Very flavorful noodles with a nice finish of wasabi.  The wasabi adds that kick without spice to balance the sweetness of the noodles.  The thinly sliced grilled pork and pickled cabbage that top the noodles were perfect as well.

Onto my review.\n\nThis place is surprisingly small. Tables are tucked very close together. I was able to listen to my neighbors' entire conversation. You get these white paper place mats with a tiny cut out of a house. It's a simple touch but it gave quite the impression. There wasn't much decor to this place. Very simple and plain. The food must be good because the place was never empty and there was always a group of people waiting for a table. The House attracts a pretty diverse crowd. I was really impressed. \n\nDon't let the website fool you. It may look cheap as hell but the food more than makes up for it. They have specials that are not on the menu and I remember every darn thing the waitress was reading off sounding really tempting. I was getting overwhelmed by all the choices I had which I surprisingly all liked. My friend had mentioned they make the best sea bass so I decided to go with that. Hopefully the next time I come back they'll still have the black miso cod. The sea bass was really thick and juicy. Just judging by it first glance, it would look like it was grilled so black that the fish was probably hard. The second that first bite hit my mouth it was as if I was in heaven. The fish literally melted in my mouth. It was really juicy and buttery. It was cooked perfectly. I don't have one bad thing to say about it except there should've been more of it! It was served with green beans and the warm wasabi house noodles. It also came with this sweet garlic soy sauce that I poured over the green beans. It tasted like something you order at a Chinese restaurant. Don't get too happy with the sauce or it'll get salty.\n\nFor dessert, we got the red velvet cake. Oh dear my. The presentation was awesome. The cake was very soft and moist but the cream cheese is what got me. It had just a small hint of sourness but it was mostly sweet. Sometimes the cheese and the cake can be a little too sweet but The House made it perfect so it would complement eachother. Neither component overpowered the other. \n\nThe House definitely did not disappoint one person in our party. Each dish had their own specific flavor. Not one of them tasted the same. Make sure you make reservations a few days before. We called the day before and the only earliest time they had available was 9:30PM. The service was very friendly and efficient.

Does it live up to the hype, though? No.\n\nI really wanted to love The House (I spent a good amount of time online beforehand researching what dishes to order and salivating over the beautiful yelp pictures of the food), however I left slightly disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the food IS good - I just don't think it merits the 2,000 person 4.5 star average. It's the same kind of disappointment I felt after Aziza (except there, the entrees didn't actually taste good).\n\nWe tried:\n- The hamachi sashimi appetizer - 3.5 stars (the fish quality was good but the salsa-like topping was more bland than I'd hoped)\n- The deep fried salmon roll appetizer - 3.5 stars (good, but I likely wouldn't order them again (IMHO the wasabi way overpowered the otherwise tasty salmon).)\n- The sea bass with garlic noodles - 4 stars (the main reason we came) (the fish was cooked well, the ginger / soy sauce actually made the fish slightly sweeter (which I wasn't expecting).. and I might order it again.. but.. somehow.. I expected more!)\n\nMay go back again sometime, but will likely cross a few more off my to-try list first :)", "author": "Helen D."}

Judging from all the raves and five solid stars given away to this restaurant, I must've missed something. Perhaps it wasn't my night, but my experience here was slightly off the chart. We had a reservation at 9 pm (yes, horribly late because we couldn't get an earlier reservation as every citizen wanted to dine here that night), but arrived at 8.30pm to hope for an open table. Having no luck, we decided to wait till 9 pm after all. We told them we would walk around the North Beach neighborhood and would come back around 8.50pm, so please remember that we're here. Apparently not. They gave away our table to another party and so we had to wait for another half hour for the next table. \n\nUgh, bad start.\n\nService is somewhat decent, the waitresses are smart about their food and everything seemed timely and food was not overly delayed. But the food per se, forgive me for saying this, were not as good as what I thought it would be. Geez I waited 8 years to try this place and all I got was a basic standard sort of food. They could do better if the cut down on the saltiness on their wasabi noodles. Nonetheless, I had a favorite dish; the risotto with grilled wild shrimp (or something like that in the name) Risotto was cooked perfectly, creamy and everything. Shrimp was good and fresh too. \n\nI might come back, perhaps in the next 8 years.", "author": "Rika P."}

Yes it's that good.\n\nCame here with my family after hearing our neighbors raving about how scrumptious this place is.  Well, it is that good.\n\nWhere to begin...oh yes.  We started with an appetizer special that was served tonight: perfectly-seared scallops with microgreens and herbs on top, complemented with a delicious mustard sauce.  I've never had scallops that were so perfectly cooked: seared well on the outside, but so buttery inside...\n\nThat was just the appetizer.  After having the great appetizer, our entrees came:\n\"Warm wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak\"\n\"Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy\"\n\"Grilled ahi tuna with spicy mustard aioli\"\nA special that showcased halibut with some great curry (don't remember the exact name...)\n\nWell where to start!  The steak was cooked perfectly and the wasabi noodles were definitely one of a kind.  The sea bass literally melted upon eating, and the garlic ginger soy perfectly accented the delicacy of the fish.  The tuna was delicious and the mustard aioli tasted almost like a wasabi sauce, so the taste perfectly accompanied the rare ahi tuna.  The halibut was delicious, and the curry had a great earthy taste to it.\n\nUpon completion, we had to have a go with the dessert menu.  We ordered the apple crumb pie a la mode, mango tapioca, and the creme brulee.  I'm not necessarily a very experienced dessert taster, but the tapioca and the creme brulee were pretty good.  The apple crumb however...was pretty much the best apple pie I ever had.  It managed to taste naturally sweet, with no noticeable additional sugar that plagues many other pies.  Then the crumb atop was so crisp and had a great texture.  \n\nOverall, it was a great family experience to eat at such a high quality restaurant such as \"The House\".  This place definitely deserves a definite-must-return!", "author": "Brian S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-03-25", "description": "OMG....the food here is Outstanding!  I went here with my girlfriend on a whim and with no reservations.  They originally told us about a 45 minute wait so they took my number and we went to a bar next door.  Before I could even finish 1 beer they call me and tell me they have a table ready!  Awesome!  We started off with the ahi tuna tare tare and the charred octopus salad with fried pork skin.  The tuna was good and had a nice spice to it, but the real hitter was the charred octopus salad!  That thing was amazing!  It's basically a lot of finely sliced veggies thrown together with octopus and chicharron in a light vinaigrette - everything complemented everything else so well - the tanginess, the textures, the slight hint of spice - soooo good.  It's probably the only other salad (next to my mom's chinese chicken salad) that I would completely fill my belly on and be totally satisfied.  \n\nSo, naturally with a good start like that, I was extremely excited for main course.  I ordered the flank steak over wasabi noodles.  Sounded a little odd at first and like it wouldn't go together, but boy was I surprised.   I had ordered it medium rare, and it came out that way!  I hate the places that ask you how you want it, just to get a dry, overcooked, tasteless waste of meat.  Anyway, the two just went together beautifully - the meat was tender and the noodles were tasty, slightly spicy and complemented the meat well.  I'd say this is probably the only dish I've ever had that incorporated noodles and steak on the same plate and it blew me away.  \n\nMy girlfriend ordered the pork chop - not as good as what I had, but still awesome.  The chop was cooked medium (chef's recommendation) and I don't think I've ever tried a juicier pork chop.  There wasn't a single millimeter of meat that wasn't tender and juicy.  \n\nThe House has certainly jumped to the top of my list as one of the best restaurants in the Bay Area and possibly the world!", "author": "Karl D."}

The House is a small restaurant nestled in North Beach. In a district full of cheesy and over-the-top Italian restaurants, it's a little funny to find a Asian fusion restaurant tucked in the corner of Grant Avenue and Broadway Street. But, it was absolutely delicious and I would highly recommend it to anyone.\n\nI started the meal with the hamachi sashimi special of the day and the deep-fried chicken liver with greens. The hamachi was so fresh and literally melted in my mouth. The deep-fried chicken liver is a pass. I thought the breading was a little too thick and masked the taste of the chicken liver. I also got to try the crab cake and I loved it. The breading wasn't too thick and the crab filling was plentiful and fresh-tasting.\n\nThe House cooks fish perfectly. My favorite dish was the miso cod; second favorite was the salmon; and third favorite was the sea bass. I don't think I've ever had fish cooked so well in my life. The miso cod was one of the specials of the night and served with two uncut sushi rolls on top. The cod was almost buttery and the sauce complemented it perfectly. If you see the miso cod on the menu, order it! The salmon was a nice-sized fillet and very moist, served on top of bok choy. My sea bass was soft and came with a ginger soy sauce. While the sea bass was also very good, the cod and salmon were even better.\n\nMy friends raved about the pomegranate pork chop and it had a nice honey glaze on it. While tasty, the flavor reminded me of a piece of BBQ pork (char siu) that you can buy at Cantonese restaurants. I feel like I could eat a piece of char siu and be just as satisfied. The fish is better and I would definitely choose any of their fish dishes over the pork chop.\n\nFor dessert we ordered the chocolate cake, apple crumb pie and mango tapioca. All of the desserts were solid. I liked that the chocolate cake wasn't too heavy, but it still had a rich chocolate taste. I love that the apple crumb pie had big pieces of baked apples and the crumb topping was yum. The mango tapioca reminded me of a classic Asian dessert and I think it's my favorite out of the three. Honestly, we were all a little full (because the portions at The House are so generous) and couldn't even finish all of our desserts.\n\nIf you do go to The House, be sure to make reservations. The restaurant is really small and I saw tables being turned away at 8 p.m. on a Monday night! Don't let that deter you because I guarantee you'll love it!\n\nRead more reviews and see photos on my blog: http://rbjello.wordpress.com/2012/03/12/asian-fusion-goodness-at-the-house/", "author": "Jackie T."}

The funny thing I noticed about good Asian restaurants is they are located next to some shady looking places. The House can be hard to find but just look for the pink lingerie shop. You can't miss that! The inside of this place is very crowded. It's like sardines packed into a can here. Most be because they are very popular and the small-ish restaurant they have.\n\n== Food ==\n\nThe presentation of the food here is quite amazing.\n\nTuna tartare is great. Quite delicious. Chopped chunks of tuna on an interesting triangle chip.\n\nFried calamari was alright, but there's nothing special about it. Just like any plain old fried calamari you can get any where.\n\nKurobuta pork chop is amazing! It's really juicy and soft and very tasty. It comes as a piece of pork on a bone with a side of mashed potatoes and some sort of chip. The chips kind of look like bunny ears especially when they're placed pointing up in the mash potatoes. There's an interesting sauce they used. It's like a Chinese bbq pork sauce. This is my favorite dish.\n\nWasabi noodle with flatiron steak. The noodles are a bit spicy and pretty good. The steak wasn't so great at all. It was pretty good over all.\n\nChicken something. I forget the name, but it was pretty juicy and the sauce was tasty.\n\n== Service ==\n\nService was good.

The first time I came here was I believe about five years ago. I don't remember much from then,but I did remember the restaurant was small and we waited for a while. I've heard even though you have reservations you might have to wait for a while, about 30mins. Without reservations you could be waiting for easily 2 hours. So I suggest making reservations.\n\nParking is always crazy so after we found a spot we headed to The House. It was pouring rain so we got seated right away. So if it's pouring rain, it's a good time to go. We were seated and immediately served drinks. They give you a small plate of cucumber pieces soaked in vinager that was really good. Only thing is that they charge you if you want more. We ordered our food right away. My girlfriend ordered the seabass, which sounded like the most popular according to yelp. Her mother ordered the steak, and I ordered the Ono. \n\nThe Ono was delicious and looked like a scuplture. The seabass was delicious with the yummy mashed potatoes. The green beans however were not so great. With my meal I had the lychee black ice tea and it made my meal taste better. \n\nFor dessert we ordered the coconut creme brulee, chocolagte truffle cake, and the apple crisp. My favorite was the apple crisp because it was warm and delicious with the vanilla ice cream. The creme brulee was good, except for some burnt parts on the sugar top. The chocolate truffle cake was a little too rich for me, but it was perfect for my girlfriend's mother so she ate it.\n\nOverall service was good. I've heard from friends and family that they haven't gone back because of the horrible service from their last visit. I on the other hand had great service and a great meal. It's on the pricey side so its good to go every once in a while.", "author": "Garrett L."}

I visited SF this past weekend and a couple of friends recommended this place.  \n\nIt's a small restaurant w/ very little tables.  Luckily, we came in before the lunch rush so we were able to get a table for our party of 6.  After we sat, the lunch crowd came in and every table was filled.  \n\nWe started with the salmon egg rolls.  I'm not going to lie, I was a little reserved about trying it b/c I don't like sashimi type fish.  The salmon was actually seared, and pretty much cooked.  It was much better than I thought it would be.  I would definitely order this again.\n\nI ordered the sea bass.  Although a little more pricey than most of the other lunch options, it was hands down, the best dish of our entire group.  The ginger sauce was light on the ginger and the ginger pieces sort of fall to the bottom; so, since I don't really like ginger, I completely avoided it.  The sea bass was served on a bed of shanghai noodles and string beans that were both done just right.  The sea bass was well flavored and not dry.  Most importantly, it melted in your mouth! soooooo goood!\n\nOne of my friend's had the wasabi noodles.  It was the same type of shanghai noodles that I had but with a hint of wasabi.  If you like wasabi, then you would like it.  2 of my other friends ordered the Korean short ribs.  It was pretty good but a little sweet.  My sister had the curry noodles.  It is good if you shared b/c you can get sick of it after awhile.  My other friend had a pork sandwich.  The pork was well flavored and not dry at all.  \n\nFor dessert, we had a pecan pumpkin pie and mango tapioca.  Both were excellent.  The pie was not too sweet and had a condensed milk sauce around it.  the mango tapioca was refreshing and light.  \n\nThe service was not bad.  The waitress came back to get us refills on our drinks and to check up on us even though it seemed that they were a little understaffed.  \n\n\nGreat food.  My next trip to SF, I would have to make sure to go back.  My friends all said that the place is packed for dinner; even w/ reservations, they said that they still wait for about 30 mins.

My entree was the other salmon dish, a sesame soy glazed fillet. It was pretty good--though the girl next to me absolutely loved the bonito sake broth under the fillet. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their dishes, and I was amused how many of them seemed to incorporate the housemade kimchi into the presentation. It seemed a little odd flavorwise, but who am I to question the chef! \n\nService was good, although there were a couple issues with the bill at the end (which they took care of). \n\nDefinitely a nice place, especially for a date.", "author": "David Z."}

FROM the complimentary cucumber all the way to dessert.. no complaints on food whatsoever. My Dad ordered the seabass. It was super fresh and don't even need the sauCE they give you on the side. The sauce did taste really good though but the fish by itself was so tasty and fresh that You don't want to cover any of the taste. The noodles tasted of the pan it was cooked with which was awesome! I know.. it a weird way to describe it.. but it good! I had the Mahi Mahi with mussels in coconut sauce.. I thought the coconut will be bam in your face like Thai food or Filipino food.. but it was actually subtle.. again.. more not to take away from the freshness of the Mahi Mahi and mussels..

So, which place do I choose first to review? One of my favorites of course: The House. \n\nI've been here several times and I always have a great experience. Honestly, it's so hard writing this review because just thinking about the place makes me crave it!\n\n*Food: 5 stars. Though I haven't tried everything on the menu, there hasn't been a dish I've tried from here that I haven't liked. Pick any dish, I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Here's a few I've tried:\n\nUnagi over Avocado & Wasabi rice: 5000000 stars! WHY HAVE THEY STOPPED SERVING THIS? THIS WAS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE APPETIZER THEY HAD! The most recent time I had come here, I couldn't find it on the menu. I was most excited about going here for this appetizer. I asked our waitress where it was, and she told me they had stopped serving it because it was too expensive :( My heart broke. Somebody please correct me if they start serving it again (& tell me ASAP so I can get myself over there!)\n\nAngus Flat Iron Steak w/ Wasabi Noodles: 4 stars; I'm not usually a huge steak fan, but I can appreciate something cooked with a lot of care. The steak wasn't too chewy and it was delicious with the wasabi noodles. I love these noodles. Some other entrees with the noodles have the option of changing the noodles to rice, but honestly, I wouldn't do it. Unlike other restaurants who's dishes come with a side of noodles, The House's Wasabi Noodles aren't too dry and have great flavor. \n\nKurobuta Pork Chop with Pomegranate Currant Sauce: 4.5 stars; Best pork chop I've ever had! And that pomegranate sauce is absolute perfection. It rests on top of some mashed potatoes which was delicious as well, but definitely was a great supporting side to make the pork chop the star of the show.\n\nGrilled Sea Bass with Garlic Ginger Soy: 5 stars! If I could give it more stars, I would. The House's sea bass will ruin sea bass for you. I can't find a place that serves it as perfect as this. Each bite melts in your mouth. Honestly, you don't need to dip it in the sauce--it's THAT good. I still do because that sauce is just as perfect with the sea bass. What I love about it garlic ginger soy is that it isn't too salty at all. This dish is served with the wasabi noodles and some string beans, but again, you have the option of changing the noodles to rice.\n\n*Service: 4.5 stars. They have their off moments of course, but out of all the times that I've been there, nothing major really stands out. It's a small restaurant, so there's always someone around if you need something. Each waiter/waitress I've had was very polite and gave their honest recommendations for a meal. They didn't come over to check on us too often, but they always kept a close watch in case we needed them.\n\n*Price Range: The few times I've been here, I've spent anywhere between $50 to $95 between two people for dinner. Depending on the items you get and if you get an appetizer, the prices should be about the same range. This place is worth every dollar I've spent.\n\nA few tips: Apparently their new policy for reservations is that you must call before 5pm to make one for that day. The most recent time I went there, I had tried to make a reservation around 6 o'clock for 8pm, but they said they never got it since they only check their voice mail one time at 5pm. Wish I had known that sooner. Luckily for us, it wasn't too busy that night and we were seated after about less than 10 minutes of waiting. \n\nAnother tip: Parking! There isn't much parking around the area. What I've done in the past if I couldn't find any metered street parking is either drive around several times (although I will rarely do this since usually I'm extremely hungry, haha), use the valet a few streets down at the Bocce Cafe (It's either $10 or $15 for non customers from what I remember) or avoid this altogether and take a taxi from wherever am in SF for that day.", "author": "Jeanelle A."}

The duck was placed on top of mashed potato and asparagus. The whole plate was filled with the blackberry sauce with a few blackberries in it. The sauce was so savory.

I felt like we had stumbled into a random restaurant in Chinatown that actually happened to be in the middle of North Beach.\n\nI let out a sigh, and decided to let go of my snooty perception of the restaurant before giving the House my final judgment. \n\n[ DINING EXPERIENCE ]\n\nFor appetizers, we shared: \n-  Pan-seared day boat scallops: This was my favorite dish of the night, as it was cooked perfectly from inside out.  The scallops were incredibly crisp on the outside, but slowly melted in your mouth as you continued to devour the buttery greatness. \n-  Oysters on the half shell with spicy cilantro mignonette:  Oysters were good, but not the best that I've had.  My suspicion was that the mignonette sauce was too overwhelming.\n-  Caesar salad with crispy scallops: This was one hell of a salad.  I'm not a huge fan of greens, but throw in scallops and I'm satisfied!\n\nFor dinner, we ordered:\n-  Angus rib-eye steak with teriyaki &  garlic butter: This was my main dish, which I regret ordering after trying the boyfriend's sea bass.  It's not that the rib-eye was dire, but it was so over-the-top drenched in garlic and butter that you couldn't really taste the natural meat flavors.\n-  Sea bass with garlic ginger soy: Hands down - this is the best sea bass I have ever tried.  I take that back.  This is the best FISH I have ever had.  Similar to the day boat scallops, each bite left me dazed and yearning for more.\n\n[ FINAL JUDGMENT ]\n\nI would've gladly given the House 5 stars, but after finding a HAIR in the garlic ginger soy for the sea bass, I lost my appetite and (developing) interest.  It's like going on a first date - you can't forget a bad impression!  The thought of someone else's hair in our food lingered in my mind throughout the night.  And although the waitress attempted to make it up to us with free dessert, it just wasn't enough to make it up to me - the snob.  It also didn't help that our waitress was inhospitable and remote from beginning to end.\n\nBUT - service aside and the-hair-in-our-food aside, the food was pretty outstanding.  Since the restaurant is so dark, I just recommend that you sit by the window so you can see if there's hair in your food!", "author": "Judy C."}

Money.\n\nEntrees:\n\nPork chop with pomegranate reduction - mash was good, and had chunks of sweet potato in it which was a nice flavor profile.  The chop was a bit more medium-rare than medium but still good.  Pomegranate reduction was good, not too sweet.\n\nKobe skirt steak special - mash again, chinese broccoli was standard.  The black bean sauce was good; traditionally black bean sauce is super potent, but this was perfect flavor and depth to let the Kobe still shine.\n\nDessert:\n\nCoconut Creme Brulee - Passion fruit syrup was a nice touch.  The creme brulee was super silky.  Sugar on top could've used a touch more torching but still good.  \n\nWine was good too, but it had nothing to do with them.

A long long time ago, there were two locations, one in the inner Sunset (I think that was the original location) and this one in North Beach.  This restaurant has always been fantastic.  And there's always an excellent choice of wine.  \n\nMy boss from many years ago introduced me to this restaurant.  She mentioned that she grew up in the same area as the restaurant owner.  My boss' family was also in the restaurant business, so she knew the owner of this restaurant really well.  The first time I went there, she introduced her small group of employees to the owner.\n\nI was so pleasantly surprised by the uniqueness (especially for that time) of the Asian fusion idea.  And I'm really not a fan of Asian fusion food, but this place is the exception.  I try to come here every year, and this restaurant has never disappointed.  Everything from the food, wine, and the wait staff - superb.  \n\nPerhaps most importantly, I think this is the perfect date spot.", "author": "Olivia L."}

The meal was unpleasantly heavy, while I was hoping for a pleasant, melt-in-your mouth fattiness.  \n\nI ordered the special for the night - black cod. It was delicious.

This was good, but I can't remember what else was in it, so it mustn't have been that spectacular.\n\nThen we had a fried soft shell crab. The flavors here were delicious.

TRUST ME! IT WILL CHANGE YOUR MIND. And maybe even your life.\n\nThe sea bass is literally melt in your mouth, delicious, I've-died-and-gone-to-heaven goodness! I've had a lot of freakin' sea bass in my life. Mainly the sea bass you get from dad's fresh fishing, or your good old Chinese restaurant. I've had some good. I've had some bad. But this.... is UNBELIEVABLE. End of story.\n\nWell, not quite the end of the story just yet. I think we need to rewind just a little bit.\n\nI've been hearing about this place for more than just a while now. The shitty parking is what's been keeping me away. Also, I'm not the biggest fan of calling in reservations. I'm more of an opentable snob. So when I called in and got somewhat of a rude and rushed attitude, I was pretty sure I'd dock them down a point or two with my review.\n\nWe ended up making reservations for 6:30 (5 days ahead of time), which we then had to change to a later time (the day of our dinner reservation). The soonest table available for reservations was 8:30, so we went with that. We were told that we could try coming in earlier and potentially getting in sooner than that. So when we got there a bit past 7:00pm, we went up to one of the ladies at the desk what happened, and she immediately remembered my name. Plus plus ++\n\nShe put me on the expedited waitlist and said it would be about 20 minutes. We had to wait in the cold for approximately 5 minutes before she came to grab us. Not bad! Plus plus ++ again!\n\nWe ordered the crab cakes, asparagus, rib eye, sea bass with garlic noodles, and then added the order of tuna tartar afterwards. I also got myself some chrysanthemum tea!\n\nThe asparagus was amazing. Mmmmmm... I could've used a 2nd bowl probably. The seasoning and sauce was just perfection. It was crunchy and fresh. And I know we've all had crappy asparagus where we had to spit the remains out before. Not here at The House; not here.\n\nThe crab cake was delicious! Not too fried or crunchy, just the way I like it. I probably could have had the whole thing to myself too!\n\nI tried a bit of the rib eye, which was good. But the sea bass stole the show, and my dining companion could only agree. Trying to describe it any further would still do it no justice, so PLEASE try for yourself and see! The garlic noodles that came with it was also amazing; not dry at all. The flavors, texture, and colors just combined perfectly!\n\nMid way through the dinner, we decided to also order the tuna tartar. This would be the only dish we could've done without. I personally felt that it was under-seasoned and kind of bland. This is the only item I would not order again.\n\nBut back to the fabulous dinner! Everything else was truly amazing and of very high quality. We did not have too much room for dessert after 3 appetizers and 2 entrees between us 2. I would love to try some next time though!\n\nI saw a mix of people here, with many Asians included. I'm gonna be real here. Most times when you read up on a place that is Asian, or Asian fusion, you arrive to find many many customers (but without an Asian in sight). The House is different. I saw Asian people here! The Chinese family that sat next to us spoke the language too, and appeared to have been here before. So no, this is not just good Asian/Asian fusion for white people. It's good for Asian people too. ABCs! Take your families here! They will be impressed!\n\nSuper excited to come back. Will definitely call in to make the reservation. And although I'm usually the type of try different dishes on a different visit, I will definitely order the sea bass again. The food was soooo amazing that I decided not to take off any points from the first phone encounter I had.", "author": "Elaine H."}

Scallops, mango beef salad, asparagus with sesame sauce, hamachi sashimi with avocado and a mix of baby capers, finely shredded cucumber and some other magic stuff on top. Amazing. Our waitress (tall, pleasant, young Asian) was fantastic. \n\nThe missing star is for a reservation snafu,  or more precisely, how it was handled.  When I arrived I said my name and the small Asian woman went off, came back and then said, sorry no reservation for Robert. I never mentioned a Robert. I told her my name again: Pxxxxx Rxxxxx. She came back and said yes, she had found Rxxxxx. She showed me to the table. After we had ordered and received our appetizers she came to our table, clearly very stressed and stood over us asking in a somewhat accusatory tone whether there had been a mistake because the real Rxxxxx had arrived.  I told her that I had called the day earlier, that someone had returned my call and confirmed me that very morning. She was doubtful in a knitted-eyebrow, intense unwavering gaze manner and then blurted that it didn't make sense because they usually fill up a week in advance. \n\nI'm not even sure what she was thinking. That we had snuck in under a false name and fooled them? I told her my cell number and asked her to check the phone record so she could see that they had called me. She didn't take me up on it, but spent the next 15 minutes fussing nearby and being generally odd. That and the fact that it is a very small crowded restaurant and somewhat loud made it a little distracting. The food however was so amazing and quick that we ended up laughing the whole situation away with our waitress (tall, pleasant, young) who was embarrassed by the whole thing, particularly because as she pointed out, there were several open 2-tops around us. \n\nAs we left the other woman glared at us again. It's hard to imagine what was going on for her. \n\nI'd go again, because everyone else was great and the food is incredible, but I'd wear my sphere of magical white light to protect me and ask to be seated far, far from the small, high-strung, shrewish woman.\n\nYes, of course I'm kidding about the magical sphere.", "author": "Kate G."}

Very tasty.  The salad is kind of like a cole slaw style cabbage and carrot salad, but the baby octopus was cooked perfectly tender with a nice char that added extra flavor.  \n\n(2) Pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce.  HOLY @#$!#.  I could eat this every night for the rest of the year.  Everyone knows how hard it is to make a good pork chop, but this was absolutely 100% perfectly cooked.  Meat was tender and juicy and well seasoned.  If it weren't for the sticky sauce, I would have picked it up and gnawed the meat off the bone.  \n\n(3) Sea bass with noodles.  PERFECT.  We Asians tend to prefer our fish on the rare side, so I'm always grumpy when \"Western\" restaurants overcook the fish.  Not here.  Fish was soft and tender and melted in your mouth.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-12-22", "description": "The eternal question: sea bass or black cod?\n\nI vote for the cod. You'd expect the sea bass to be a fattier fish, but the cod is by far more buttery and flaky. If you really can't stand California rolls, though, either find someone at your table who does, or else pick something else because -- to its credit -- the restaurant doesn't shirk on the sushi portion.\n\nThe sea bass comes with more distinctive sides, and it's a meatier, more robust filet. Still good, but if you're expecting the sort of fluffy, lightly-grilled whitefish you sometimes get at other restaurants when you order sea bass, go with the cod.\n\nEverything else on the menu -- and I really to mean everything -- is terrific, and the restaurant's high rating is absolutely deserved.

Parking sucks so bad here, you should come 40minutes to an hour earlier to find parking, especially around dinner time.

The place is a bit small and cramped, but the seabass lives up to its hype. the seabass was flavorful and the sauce to dip it in was my ultimate favorite. The noodles were chewy and flavorful as well as the string beans. I liked every part of my dish. My boyfriend had the warm wasabi noodles with the flatiron angus steak, which was a bit on the spicier end, but the noodles were a larger portion than mine and just as chewy. The medium rare steak was cooked perfectly, but I definitely enjoyed my dish more. We ordered oysters as a starter, but it wasn't fresh and let me down. The sauce to dip the oysters with was too spicy for me so I didn't enjoy that either. We ended our meal with the coconut creme brulee with mango puree. I didn't like the sourness of the mango puree mixed with the sweet coconut creme brulee, but the custard part was delicious and just the right sweetness.

Ok no really, I first tried this place in 2007, and most recently New Years 2011, and it's been able to retain its quality through the years. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS/TIPS\n1. Any seafood appetizer really, but especially the Maine Crab Cake or their specials. \n\n2. If you're on a date with a girl (or guy) who aren't planning on testing their waist elasticity for the night, try 2 appetizers and split the entree. More flavor exploration and diversity for a little less dinero.  \n\n3. Grilled Sea Bass. F*@% yes. This dish generates serious word of mouth. And while it's in there, it just literally melts away in these perfect flakes that disappear much too quickly. I never knew fish could be this tender outside of the raw variety. \n\n4. A Riesling to go with that Sea Bass. \n\n5. Don't count on trying to walk in for a seat. Make reservations at least 2 days beforehand if you want a decent time\n\nCONS\n- Don't expect anything service-wise past semi-attentive inquiries about your enjoyment of the food and making sure your water is filled.\n- Desserts don't quite match up to the quality of the main courses  \n- Good luck trying to find decent parking in North Beach. I usually end up at the garage @ Vallejo & Powell.\n\nPROS\n- Generally amazing quality for only $$ prices\n- Ambience is perfectly tuned for what kind of meal you'd expect there. Not too dark so you don't have to squint to see your buddies, but also dim enough for romance. \n- Speaking of romance, I saw McDreamy here once. I think he helped get my GF in the mood.

I said to myself, 4.5 stars out of 2,400+ review?  Challenge accepted.\n\nBefore showing up we had thought that it would be hard to find seating since the venue is relatively small.  Upon arriving however at 12:30 we were able to get a seat almost immediately and handed menus.  The waiter mentioned the specials for the day and gave us sometime to think it over.\n\nThe menu is simple but would definitely like to try everything on there.  I ordered the Curry Chicken Noodle and the Fried Calamari.  The Calamari obviously came first and was good, nothing too special about it.  That all changed when the actual food came.  It looked just like the pictures and the portion size was large.  Not only was the presentation great, the food was also very flavorful without being overbearing or too oily.  By the end of the meal we were all very full but kept eating until we finished every bite because it was that good.\n\nAlthough this place is listed with \"$$$\" each noodle plate is only about $11-$15 which is completely affordable given their portion sizes.\n\nIn the end I would highly recommend you to try this place as I will definitely be back until I've tried everything on their menu.  Service was good, venue was nicely appointed and very intimate.  I try not to give 5 stars but this place definitely lived up to the reviews and deserve the full 5 stars.\n\nA must try!", "author": "Zhen C."}

I especially hate giving well-acclaimed businesses such a poor review. However, The House has truly earned this rating in my books. \n\nDisclaimer: This review is based purely on the SERVICE, not the food. I've never, in my years and years of foodie dining, experienced such disrespectful and insolent service. \n\nIn a city filled with a plethora of highly calibered restaurants competing neck-to-neck with each other, it's of the utmost importance to differentiate your restaurant not only based on the food but also on the service. \n\nHere's the story in a nutshell: \n\nIt was my bf's and my 5 yr anniversary dinner celebration and we had chosen The House as our celebratory dinner for the night. We made reservations for a party of 2 at 7pm. We were driving to SF from a business conference in Palo Alto that day and got stuck in quite a bit of traffic. At 7pm, we had arrived in the North Beach hood but were looking for parking (btw - insanely hard to find one here!). I called the restaurant at precisely 7pm to let them know that we will be ~10-15 min late and are currently searching for parking/if they have any parking recommendations. The waiter replied simply with an insolent \"Your reservation will be given up if you do not arrive in 10 minutes.\" When I hung up the phone, it was 7:03pm. We scrambled for parking in the meantime and arrived into the restaurant at 7:11pm. There was a long line in front of us that the maitre'd was tending to so by the time it was our turn, the time was 7:15pm. Please note, the exact timing is being highlighted to prove the utter ridiculousness of the service. The matre'd had a brusque and ridiculously rude attitude while telling us that she cannot seat us as we are more than 30 minutes late to our reservation. At this point, I whipped out my phone and showed her the exact time of \"7:15pm\" and mentioned if anything, we are ONLY 15 min late and we were waiting in the line for almost 5 min, so we still technically made it in 10 min. Without getting into any more excruciating detail, she asked us to wait 2 hours for a table or \"get out\" (yes, \"get out\" is quoted verbatim). \n\nThere wasn't an apology or a sincere \"We're sorry. We're just so booked and had to give away your reservation but we do hope you can dine with us in the future.\" That would still be hard to stomach given that it's our anniversary dinner and we called ahead to notify them that we'll be there. However, it's INFINITELY better than how we were treated. \n\nWhen we're prepared to spend $100+ for a romantic dining experience at your restaurant, the least you can do is provide us with some basic respect. \n\nSo of course, after we were asked to get out on that busy Saturday night, we panicked for a bit and then managed to score a reservation at Jardiniere in Hayes Valley at 7:30pm. Given that we had to get from North Beach to Hayes Valley in less than 15 min amidst the traffic from the ballet and opera performances, we were a bit late again. And when I called Jardiniere to inform them (obviously panicking after the crazy House experience that had just ensued), they were so accommodating, friendly and held our reservation for us (feel free to reference my review of Jardiniere). And yes, they were equally busy as the House that night. \n\nSo moral of the story - there are numerous great restaurants in this city that have fabulous service and fabulous food. Please head to one of them instead of The House.", "author": "Priya S."}

The pork chop is the king (if you have not tried it, this should be the first thing you order).  But their black cod, sea bass, and steak are all good.  My wife likes their risotto with shrimp, too.\n\nThe small plates are good, but honestly, I think it's the entrees that steal the show and keep us coming back again and again.\n\nDon't forget to get the passionfruit creme brulee.  It's a good end-note to the meal...  think classic creme brulee but with a passionfruit shot to it that adds a tartness to balance out the sweetness of the carmelized sugar and custard.

Definitely call ahead of time (it doesn't have to be weeks in advance), or  you'll end up waiting for a bit - and there's not really a lot of space to stand if you're waiting. Service here is very quick, and the waitresses are on the ball with knowing the specials.\n\nThe food, for lack of a better word, was breathtakingly delicious. For appetizers, we had the oysters - of which I'm usually not a big fan, but the cilantro sauce added a dose of spice that really added another dimension to them. The kobe beef tartare and uni flatbreads were delicious as well. The beef was delicious on its own merits, but I really liked the uni on top of a piece of avocado - both are foods with smooth textures, and the flavors blend really well together. The entrees were great as well. I had the kurobuta pork chop; I'm usually not a huge fan of pork, but this was cooked to the right tenderness and wasn't overly fatty. It also came with a pomegranate currant, which was less fruity than anticipated (which was good) but added a slight twinge of sweetness to the dish. My fiancee had the miso grilled cod, which was perfectly cooked - the cod fell apart so quickly and was extremely tender. Lastly, the desserts - the Japanese-style pumpkin pie was fantastic. I can't pinpoint the main difference, but the natural sweetness of the pumpkin vs. the somewhat artificial canned pumpkin that is sold in the store was the main difference. The chocolate truffle cake was also delicious as well, particularly with caramel drizzled on top.\n\nThis is definitely one of my all-time favorites that I've been to. There are a lot of other interesting items on the menu that I'd like to try out sometime as well, and I do hope to come back when I'm in SF again.", "author": "Asuka N."}

This time, I had the usual, the pomogranate Porkchop. My friend the wasabi noodle and steak. And to start it off, the Eel rice where instead of being like sushi before, is more like a cream risotto now. In my opinion, it's a bit too rich now, with eel and cream sauce. \n\nBut still same great place. No complaints as ever. And made my flight out with plenty of time.", "author": "Vince E."}

This is the best seafood/asian fusion restaurant in the city. The cuisine is simply sublime. \n\nWe started with the fried salmon rolls, which are far from what you would expect - not ground salmon, but big, bold strips glistening inside a wonton wrapper. \n\nThen the seared scallops swimming in a rich lemon sauce, topped with fresh watercress, presented beautifully with a dollop of caviar on a cucmber in the center. It was an array of colors worthy of Van Gogh, almost too beautiful to eat. \n\nFollowed by the ahi tuna tartare served in what tasted like a wasabi glaze, presented on wontons for ease of operation, and the octopus salad, which is a blend of textures, from crunch pork rinds to crisp vegetables to chewy cephalopod. And finally, the soft shelled crab which is presented like something out of science fiction, but extremely tasty and fresh. \n\nMain entrees were the steak, sea bass, and the mushroom rice with bonito flakes. The mushroom rice was easily the standout dish - delicate, flaky, fishy bonito on rice with the texture of risotto. The steak was extremely tender, and the sea bass was moist, flavorful and delicious. Each of these one dishes could have been \"the best dish\" at any other restaurant. All the deserts, equally good. The upside down cake and chocolate cake in particular.", "author": "Neal P."}

We've tried almost everything on the menu, including the specials, but my favorite dishes are the Grilled Sea Bass and Scallops (appetizer). I also LOVE their caramelized cauliflower, which is a side entr\u00e9e dish. I love the texture, sweetness, spices, and the flavor of it. But pretty much everything on their menu is delicious, so I can't help but order 3-4 appetizers on top of my main entr\u00e9e and my boyfriend's entr\u00e9e. Oh! We also order dessert too : ) I prefer American or European cuisine over Asian (except Korean food), but they elevated the traditional Asian dishes by adding a hint of American spices, which I must say, they perfected the taste. \n\nI would love to give The House 5 stars, BUT I must subtract 1 star for their lack of friendliness and attentiveness. Although they remember us, I don't feel a sense of connection or rapport with the waitresses, which I hope we had since we visit so often. Although I am quite critical when it comes to service, their food is wayyyy too delicious. Therefore, they are an exception to the rule : )\n\nOne thing to note: make reservations, or be prepared to wait.

In fact, I didn't find it particularly overpriced either, it seemed fair based on the high quality ingredients and presentation.\n\nIt's the service and the general feel of the place that was a let down. Nothing wrong with the ambiance, but the place was always a bit overcrowded. Also, the host was rather inconsiderate and told us the wait was 30 minutes when it was nearly 1 hour, without giving us an update unless we asked. Also, our server was very cold and impersonal, just placing the food on the table and leaving. \n\nFor future reference, a reservation online is a must. Second, you must try the Pork Chop, it has the most incredible pomegranate glaze! The salmon roll was a tasty appetizer, and the Kobe Salad special was light and flavorful. Lastly, the dessert was a chocolate \"cream pie\" though it was basically just a mousse...very decadent nonetheless.

Started off with an evening's special that consisted of tuna poke with avocado which was simple and sublime.  The nature of the place is unassuming and allowed us to make friends with the neighbors just to the right of us and split some excellent sake.  All in all The House is a win.

So maybe we made reservations for 10 pm and didn't get seated till 1040...who cares.  It was well worth it. The ambiance was warm and intimate in this small, nearly shack-like restaurant. That coupled with some fantastic food definitely redeemed every one of those 40 minutes I waited.  \n\nThe roasted unagi with avocado rice stole the show. It was a meaty portion of eel with just a light coat of eel sauce. The rice was moist, brightened up by some avocado.  We split the seabass for an entree which turned out to be the perfect complement to the unagi. It was light and fresh compared to the heavier tastes we started with. I totally recommend both fish!\n\nWe also had a couple sidekicks like kobe beef tartare and shrimp and chives dumpling. It was hard to taste the beef in the tartare, cause it was heavily mixed with aioli. The crostini and apple gave it good texture but the flavors just weren't gelling all that well to me. And the dumplings were probably playing it safe- they turned out tasty but ordinary.\n\nThey play the Asian fusion menu really well and while some of the apps were nothing special, the unagi and seabass were just amazing.

It is consistent and delicious and really is my favorite restaurant in the world.  I don't love Asian Fusion but they do it right.  \n\nI never get to go out much to the city with two young kids, but I would choose House for any birthday or anniversary celebration if I could.  They don't disappoint, unlike other higher priced places.\n\nMy musts are the salmon roll (love the spicy sauce), Rib-eye and Sea Bass (so tender and tasty!).  Other items were good but less memorable. I have tried their pork chops when I was pregnant, asked for it well-done and it was still amazing and tender.  I love their Mango Tapioca and Chocolate cake too.  I also love that their presentation is nice, they include crispy/crunch elements into their dishes, have interesting sides and use different types of greens.  Most recently tried their scallop special and they were so delicious.  They take great care with their garnishes and sauces - they all work together beautifully.\n\nI do wish their beer and wine was served colder, and that they would buy some newer plates, but I appreciate their prices are relatively low.  Their portions have definitely shrunk but their prices are still so low I can't complain.  I used to be so stuffed I couldn't enjoy my dessert without being uncomfortable but now I can easily polish off my desserts and not feel regretful.  If they ever open a larger, more elegant location, I would pay higher prices to eat there for sure.\n\nThey once had a terrible waitress that we actually left no tip for (she was THAT BAD), but now all their servers seem nice and friendly.  \n\nSometimes I try their specials and they underwhelm, but nothing has ever been bad there, just not as good as my usual favorites, and I end up wishing I ordered something else.  \n\nYes, get an early reservation, arrive with plenty of time to circle and find parking and enjoy a good table not squished in between others.  I would not suggest going with a party of more than 2 actually.  Enjoy some delicious, inventive food without breaking the bank!

No one ever came by to ask us how we were doing. Had to ask three different people for the bill.

It's Chinese-American Fusion like my parents used to make sorta =), but well, add in a few decades of culinary evolution, and you'll have what they have here.  The food is very consistent in quality over the YEARS that I've been coming here.\nService: Great this time! (more details below..)\n\nMy wife and I usually try to avoid North Beach on the weekends, but since we had a special occasion to celebrate, we braved the partying crowds of Halloween and the nearly impossible parking situation to make it to our restaurant of choice for the evening - The House.\n\nOnce there, we had to wriggle our way in through the door to get our names on the waiting list.  Yes, it helps to have reservations, but after about 35-45 minutes of standing near the door, enjoying the scene and studying the menu by the window, we earned our table.  So you CAN do it without reservations, but ya just have to wait a little.\n\nFor appetizers, I ordered the Mixed green salad with Avocados, Apple and with White Shrimp Tempura.  It was delivered without delay.. only about five or six minutes after ordering. I rarely say \"WOW.. that was good\" involuntarily about any appetizer, but here.. I did!  It's THAT good.\n\nMy wife ordered one of the specials for the week - a hothouse Tomato Soup served with a fried clam on top of a small dollop of mashed potatoes.  No disappointment here. Soup was light, and the fried clam seem to have been fried in their same batter as their calamari.  It was a delectable beginning to a terrific dinner.\n\nI had been pining for a decent steak over the last week or so, and while The House is probably known best for it's seafood and pork entrees, I ordered the Angus Rib-Eye in a garlic-butter sauce as my main course.  This red meat offering is usually served over a bed of mashed potatoes with Chinese Mustard Greens.  As for my preferences, I had them substitute rice instead of the mash, which they were glad to do.  The entree arrived medium-well just as I had hoped, seared and caramelized beautifully both aromatically and visually.  YUM!  Each careful bite was incredible and savored with much care.\n \nService?  Hmm. this time, it was actually pretty friendly for once. Our waitress was attentive, not obtrusive, and water service was right-on. No waiting, no issues with \"throwing menus\" in front of the customer.

You definitely need a reservation, as it's a tight space with no real waiting area.  \n\nYou start with house made pickles that get the appetite going.  We went for the calamari appetizer, which literally came out in like 2 minutes.  It was a little tough to enjoy as people waiting by the door kept bumping into our chair, and there was a huge chilly draft every time the door opened.  The calamari itself is nice and crisped and not overdone, with a pretty standard cocktail sauce, garnished with shredded kimchee.\n\nThey had a lot of specials on the menu that night, but as everyone had recommended the sea bass, I had to get it. It was tender but had a nice sear on one side, and it was flaky but not too rich.  It had a good amount of flavor for something not drowned in sauce, although a small drizzle of the reduced soy glaze helps it out a lot.  I got it with rice, which ended up being plain white rice, so I think noodles would have been a better option.  The stir fried green beans were thin and flavorful but very oily.\n\nThen we were debating between the pork chop and the steak, and the wasabi noodles for the flat iron steak helped it get chosen.  The steak was pretty tender, but it lacked the flavor I expected.  The beef was fresh, but maybe it just needed some more salt and pepper?  On the other hand, the noodles underneath are well seasoned, with a little kick from the wasabi, which was not overpowering.  \n\nPortion sizes are pretty good and left us a little too full for dessert.  \n\nAm I the only one not giving them 5 stars??  It wasn't bad, but I think it was just too hyped up.  Prices are very reasonable for what you get, but I tend to be pretty critical with fusion style restaurants.

Each salmon roll is wrapped with seaweed and then deep-fried. I loved the contrast of textures between the chewy salmon and crunchy exterior. Go easy with the Chinese mustard - it has a strong kick and definitely cleared up my sinuses  :D\n\nFor entrees, my boyfriend and I decided to share the special - a halibut with clams in coconut curry and the infamous seabass with wasabi house noodles instead of the garlic noodles. I was blown away by the presentation! The seabass was AMAZING! The texture is so smooth, soft, and perfectly chewy. The seasoning was a touch too salty, but other than that it was perfect! The wasabi noodles were a little on the oily side and I didn't taste any wasabi in the noodles. The halibut and curry was good, but the seabass stole the show that night!\n\nWe shared the coconut creme brulee for dessert which was good, but nothing amazing. I ordered the lychee iced tea which is unsweetened (but you can request for sugar on the side) - it had the perfect hint of lychee flavor - delicious! \n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant is simple and cozy. The tables are crammed a little too close together. The table next to ours was clearly fit for two people maximum, but they still tried to cram three (big) people to one small table. The service was not bad, but felt rushed. The food came out so fast, as soon as we were done with our appetizers (literally 2 minutes later) they came out with the entrees. We were seated at 7PM and were finished with dinner by 7:45PM. Also, the restaurant is pretty loud, so the waitresses need to speak up! I could barely hear them when they were introducing the specials... \n\nParking in North Beach area is hard to find, but we got really lucky and parked around Washington Square Park. Be prepared to spend a good 20 minutes circling for a spot or pay for parking in the garages. \n\nThe food is creative, packed with lots of flavor, and beautifully presented. Prices are very reasonable as well. I definitely recommend checking out The House!!", "author": "Eva W."}

We have been going here for 10 years and it is outstanding every single time.  We always make reservations as it is a very small restaurant which is packed with locals and usually has a line out the door.  \n\nThe food is to put it simply - perfect.  We usually eat seafood when we dine here and I highly recommend the salmon, sea bass and black cod.  It is always cooked to perfection and each has its own unique flavor. No trip to The House is complete without an order of the tempura stringbeans.  They are one of the best appetizers I have ever had and are truly addictive. Even when we say we aren't going to have them, a table nearby will be eating them and we immediately fold and place an order. \n\nBecause the restaurant is small and the tables are close together, everyone ends up carrying on conversations with their neighbors. The last time we ate here we sat next to a young couple on their honeymoon from Georgia.  The bride told me that she did hours of research before their trip and discovered that The House was one of the most recommended restaurants in San Francisco (quite the accomplishment for a city with such great restaurants). She said it was the best salmon that she had ever had and couldn't figure out why - it was like magic.  Indeed.", "author": "Brad M."}

And it's in North Beach, which is half nasty nightclubs and half tourist traps. This restaurant also doesn't need another review, but I'm compelled to write one because the food is not only great, it's a great value for San Francisco.\n\nI came here for my birthday dinner last year and for a double date last month, and I've eaten just about everything. Your birthday is a good time to be obnoxious by sampling your guests' food at will. I enjoyed my second visit more, though, because I could don a t-shirt with jeans and eat like a T-Rex. A few of the dishes are of dinosaur proportions (e.g., wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak)!\n\nThe menu is short and simple, yet diverse and thoughtful. My favorite appetizers were the deep-fried salmon roll and roasted unagi. I don't generally care for the texture of either, but wow--these were winners. The only appetizer I didn't like was the deep-fried chicken liver because there were just too few gems in that haystack of a salad. I already eat slowly, I don't need to waste time hunting and gathering the good stuff.\n\nAs for the entrees my favorite was the butterfish special with crab sushi. The butterfish rivaled that of Roy's (http://www.yelp.com/bi...) and the crab sushi put it over the top--this is one to not share, even with a birthday girl. The wasabi house hoodles, grilled sea bass, and Niman Ranch pork chop are all great as well but simply incomparable.\n\nDinner for two could range from $50 to $100. This is a lot for Asian but reasonable for fusion. I highly recommend reservations unless you're a native Italian and ok with having dinner at 10pm--but if you're a real Italian, North Beach is definitely not your scene.", "author": "Liz T."}

So after calling and canceling a few times, I finally managed to keep the reservation and went there on a Sunday evening.\n\nThe decision on the timing was a conscious one.  I've experienced enough of North Beach traffic at its finest and didn't feel like dealing with it in my old age.  \n\nSure enough, we got there in about 15 minutes from the *other* end of town (SCORE) and were able to find a spot right outside the restaurant (DOUBLE SCORE).   \n\nWhat we didn't anticipate was that our table was still occupied by the earlier party, so we had to wait for a good 15 minutes before we were allowed in (the entrance to the restaurant was definitely not designed to hold a large amount of hopeful diners).  Thankfully, though, the food came out relatively fast because all of us were starving at that point. \n\nOur appetizers were out within 10 minutes of ordering: Roasted unagi (eel) with avocado sushi rice (Phenomenal with a capital P), ahi tuna tartare with nori chips http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZoZjbOYR-apY8XvommlNUA?select=9vRf8qmVTlGJeR6hCGFiKw (good), and the deep-fried salmon roll http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZoZjbOYR-apY8XvommlNUA?select=FyXnTNDxPk6xKT6O64OsyQ (disappointingly underwhelming).  \n\nThen along came the entree - as soon as our plates of appetizer were cleared - and again they were a bit of a hit-and-miss.  Everyone loved, loved, loved the creamy melt-in-your-mouth grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy and noodles http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZoZjbOYR-apY8XvommlNUA?select=t_zbZ3Z2VIUWZAoF8pMfMw, as well as the mushroom rice (which was almost like a risotto, only a little drier) with prawns.

We went to The House as it was heavily endorsed by some co-workers particularly the miso black cod which they described to be mind-blowing and indeed it was.\n\nBetween the 5 of us we essentially turned our dining experience family style, so we got to try a bit of everything. We split several small dishes and ordered up an entree each. Everything we had that evening was excellent, particularly the black cod. The black cod was served up with a delicious sauce and a roll cut into two pieces. The fish was brilliantly marinated/prepared, and it was so tender and buttery, I'd kill for a bite right now.\n\nThe restaurant is pretty small and the air conditioning system didn't work particularly well that evening so it got a little irritating eating sweaty.

My girlfriend and I ordered each of those, and both the Bass and the Steak were cooked perfectly, (I don't know how they get the Sea bass so light and fluffy).  The wasabi noodles were also very good, and while not the most amazing thing I've ever eaten, I think they get special points out of  their uniqueness. \n\nWe ordered the Chocolate cake for desert, which has no Asian twist to it but was also very good. I'd say it was actually closer in consistency to fudge than actual cake.\n\nThe service & the atmosphere were decent, though as mentioned by others not to the \"5 star\" caliber of the food.

The reason being as follows: the seafood-centric menu is fantastic, the prices are very reasonable and they can accomodate large-ish groups (just be sure to make reservations ahead of time, and try to arrive together, as they won't seat you unless your whole party is there). \n\nSave for some less-than-palatable oysters that were taken away without question, my meals at The House were perfect. The space is small and somewhat plain in terms of decor, but the service it excellent and the food even better. I had an amazing tuna tartare app that was beautifully balanced and super-fresh - the crispy wontons it sat atop were light and fun to eat. We also shared a plate of dumplings that, while not so exciting on their own, were drizzled in a delicious ponzu sauce  - the perfect balance of salty and sweet with a citrusy note that sang. I went with a Chilean sea bass entree that was a special that evening, and I hope for your sake they bring it back for permanent placement on the menu - this thing had an outstanding sear and flavor to it that kept me eating long after I was full, and a side of garlic noodles with some sesame-soy dressing that was beyond compare. This dish was so good, I went ahead and got it for round 2 later that week. Yup. \n\nThe wine and beer list are decent here, but not outstanding by any means. I had a Banshee Mordacai that, while a little bold, was a great accompaniment to the fish, and the table ordered a white and a rose that no one seemed that crazy about. Lesson: order the Mordacai. Order the fish (except for the oysters). Make reservations. Enjoy.", "author": "Hilary H."}

With reservations we were seated right away, small place but trust me it packs a big punch of flavorful dishes. Staff is super attentive and nice.

The noodles had a zest to it but wasn't overwhelming.  The sea bass was cooked perfectly and was complimented well by the greens and the sauce.

I grew up with heavenly tasting ripe mangoes from the Philippines and can't help but compare every time.. but this one actually reminded me of the staple dessert they'd serve after your meal at Chinese restaurants back there.. still not as good.. but a solid effort!

My dining experience here the other night will go down as one of the worst, and I'll never go back.  Our server didn't get to our table to greet us for at least 15 minutes, by then she tells us the specials but says we probably already decided on something else.  Our starter caesar salad we split came with one serving spoon left on the table with two side plates that were warm (not chilled) and so old they looked like they belonged on the buffet line at sizzler.  My ribeye was so grizzly, the only way it was even edible was because they pounded the hell out of it before they cooked it.  The server never once came by to check on us.  I can go on and on, but I won't.\n\nThis restaurant was recommended to us by a previous employee that opened a Thai restaurant in the north shore of oahu.  He did an amazing job serving us so we thought we'd get similar service here. Not!!!\n\nAs a person with over 15 years of fine dining experience, I know what a high class restaurant should be, and this is not one.  Thomas Keller would throw up if he ever ate here.

I would definitely visit again on my next trip!\n\nI was impressed with their beer selection (not a large list, but great choices) and had a Chimay red. The SO had a lychee iced tea that he wasn't as impressed with - I suspect he was supposed to mash up the one lychee to get the lychee taste, but he didn't want one mashed up lychee. Would have been better if had 2 or 3.\n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the scallops and the salmon roll. Both were tasty and we were quite pleased with them! As for mains, he got the sea bass (which lives up to all the reviews on yelp) and I got the wasabi noodles.\n\nMY BIG ADVICE: DO NOT order the salmon roll AND the wasabi noodles. Firstly, the salmon roll comes with a wasabi-based dipping sauce, so I couldn't even taste the wasabi in the wasabi noodles (until I cleared my palate with some of his white rice). Secondly, the slaw that comes with the salmon roll is the same slaw that comes on top of the steak on the wasabi noodles. This was actually pretty disappointing - as good as the slaw was, I was ready for something a bit different and I felt like this was an opportunity for the chef to present something new. \n\nI guess there was one regret ... I should have gone with the pork chop =/ But all in all, it was great fusion food (and I'm pretty picky when it comes to Asian fusion)", "author": "Stephanie W."}

I had better calamari at the Cheesecake Factory\n\nEntr\u00e9e: I had the flank steak with wasabi noodles. My steak was medium rare and it tasted really rubbery.  The wasabi noodles were drench in oil and were not very pleasant.  On the other hand, my friend's grilled sea bass was seasoned and cooked perfectly.  My sister had the lamb chops and she thought that I was ok. \n\nAmbiance: The place is very small with a bunch of tables right next to each other.  \n\nService: The service was horrible.

As for the sea bass itself: wow. Again, it was cooked to perfection with a nice crust on the outside, and a firm, yet juicy center. We didn't really use the black bean sauce on the side, as the meal had enough flavor without it, and could really stand on its own.\n\nThe House really knows how to cook a piece of fish.

Back then it was located on 9th between Irving St. and Lincoln Way. Now the place is called Kiki's (Japanese Restaurant, same owner as Kitaro's on Geary). \n\nIn any case, I was able to visit THE HOUSE this past Friday night and I can't believe I forgot about this restaurant! And I also can't believe it took me 6 years to come back to devour their awesome food. Mmm...\n\nThe place is a lot smaller than their 9th Ave location. There are about 10-15 tables in here and it's really narrow. Yes, I know what you're thinking -- MAKE RESERVATIONS!! We sat back near the kitchen so every time the door open, I saw flames go up. Way cool...but does anyone else notice the weird smell that comes breezing through? I'm not sure if its from the kitchen, the bathroom, or the servers? Shrug.\n\nI read some reviews about the House before and I have to disagree with what everyone is saying about their not-so-great service. Either you guys are real snobs and beezies and want impeccable service or their service really sucked when you went, and got better the day I came. The server started off ranting off a bunch of their specials, and I was quite proud that she remember them all. Water was constantly refilled and our plates were constantly changed. This was awesome. Service was attentive. 5 stars for that.\n\nCOMPLIMENTARY VINEGAR CUCUMBER SLICES\nBeware: VERY vinegar-ey. I choked on a piece since it was soooooo tangy but nonetheless it was very refreshing.\n\nOYSTERS\nhttp://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/I4eMNfxLsI5BMvysFiRhUQ/l\nNot as good as Foreign Cinema's oysters but still AOK in my book. The sauce it came with was a mix of...you know what I have no clue. All I know it was spicy as F!! 6 raw oysters came on a plate.\n\nSHRIMP DUMPLINGS\nhttp://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/q4YbAsSRgKnXEvBA_RnvcQ/l\n7 dumplings for $9? Sure, I guess. Kinda pricey for pretty well made dumplings but this is a must get dish for all you dumpling lovers. The shrimp wasn't mashed up into small pieces but it was a good sized chunk of shrimp in the dumpling. The chives in it were fresh. The skin was rolled thin and it was absolutely delicious. The sauce it came in was a mix of soy sauce, green onions, and a ton of vinegar. Yum.\n\nSALMON ROLLS\nhttp://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/-ccvyPaJI-lEb5PHM2Lm5g/l\no m gee. The House just put a new meaning to egg rolls. Screw egg rolls -- bring on the salmon rolls!! There are two pieces on this plate, perfect to eat by yourself or share with someone else. The salmon is fried to the point where it's half cooked -- PERFECT. The skin was fried crispy and you could barely taste the seaweed for all you non-seaweed fans. However, this dish did come with a Chinese mustard dipping sauce. It pretty much was a blend of spicy mustard and horseradish. Don't put too much on, it really gets you in the nose!!\n\nBefore I go onto the entrees that we ordered, I have to say that yes, 2 people did eat 3 appetizers, haha. Mmm after we finished these 3 dishes, we realized that The House is big on...\n1. Horseradish\n2.

But the wasabi noodles were off the hook! The noodles were chewy and of a good consistency. I was a bit turned off by the wasabi because I'm not a big fan of it but the amount of wasabi in this dish was just perfect. It didn't kick my ass nor did it completely leave me alone. I loved it. I picked out every piece of noodle until it was completely gone. Yum Yum Yum. \n\nBLACKENED COD WITH SUSHI (special for the night)\nhttp://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/vN_cg1RyrpQkeUaF9GXncQ/l\nThe infamous Sushi. This was made long just like the salmon rolls and cut in a weird way, just like the salmon rolls. The sushi was really tasty. I dipped it in the sauce that the cod came in and it was good. The sauce was similar to unagi (eel) sauce but something was different. But OMG, the cod. OMG. OMG. OMG. OMG. Melted in my mouth like butter. It was so soft, cooked to perfection. I don't even think my mom can cook fish that good. Damn, the house threw it down as far as the cod goes.\n\nDamage done: $76.50 pre-tip\n(Oh and the bill here is handwritten. On it, our waitress denoted our Shrimp Dumplings as \"DUMPY.\" I laughed for a good minute or two. Cute!)\n\nSUMMARY:\nService was attentive.

The wine, the appetizers, the entrees, the service -- it was all exceptional. \n\nWe ordered a special they had as one of our appetizers. It was a grilled calamari with something on top that made the dish look like it was movinggg ! It was a pretty exciting experience ! You must try it. Plus, the dish was full of smokey goodness ! The other starter we got was the deep fried salmon. GET IT. End of story.\n\nFor my main dish, I got the Wasabi Noodles with a Flatiron Steak, cooked medium-rare. The noodles were just the right texture and flavor, and the steak was cooked to perfection ! No condiments necessary because everything was seasoned so well.\n\nThe bf's entree was the Rib-eye steak cooked medium rare. It was total M&M's status. The steak literally melted in your mouth ! SO yummy. \n\nThe portions were also gigantic. We could have shared and topped it off with dessert at the end, but of course we didn't think things through until it was too late. Oh well.\n\nWe'll be back, we promise ! We're determined to try every plate at least once. (:", "author": "Paulina N."}

Maybe the most delicious I have ever had. The tempura green beans were good and plentiful but nothing crazy amazing. The shrimp dumplings a bit fishy. Loved my halibut and black cod (though a bit too much wasabi flavor on the cod). All in all a very delicious meal. Be sure to get the garlic noodles. Super yummy.", "author": "Jack S."}

So make sure to place a reservation before you come. \nOther than that, the food is awesome.  \n\nMy girlfriend and I started out with the deep fried salmon rolls.  I can see why it's a popular item, since the crispiness was just right, and the salmon was of good size.  Interestingly, the mustard dipping sauce that accompanied the rolls was probably my favorite part.  It had a great tangy but spicy taste to it as well (probably had wasabi).\n\nFor the main course, I ordered the Kurobuta Pork Chop W/ Pomegranate Currant Sauce.  The Pomegrante sauce was heavenly.  It was savory, but had a citrus and meaty taste.  Unfortunately the Pork Chop was a bit overcooked and a bit too chewy, but the sauce made up for it.  My girlfriend ordered the duck with a blackberry reduction.  Her duck was cooked a lot better than my pork chop, but the blackberry reduction wasn't as great as the pomegrante sauce.  \n\nWhoever the Saucier is at The House, is really talented.", "author": "John S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-03-15", "description": "We walked in at ~6:30pm without a reservation and were seated in a matter of minutes - spare table in the back in the midst of a full house, YAY!\n\nThe House really is a pleasant little surprise; located in an area full of late night drunk food and strip clubs, The House sits idly. Its a very small restaurant (like all SF restaurants), and has very limited seating - they suggest you make a reservation a month in advance in order to avoid waiting, but thankfully we got there at the time that we did since a line did start to form once we were seated.\n\nThe House's specialty is seafood, with an Asian Fusion flair. The menu at The House seems to change every now and then in order to fit whats in season, but also with 4-5 daily specials and a few staples (i.e. wasabi noodles, sea bass, kurobuta pork chop, etc.). Going off suggestions from Yelp reviews, we went with their specials and their tried and true wasabi noodles.\n\nSpecial Appetizer; Scallops w/ micro greens (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZoZjbOYR-apY8XvommlNUA?select=_eLbj9i0_JeCAaekB8W9Xw)\nI have never been a huge fan of scallops, with the exception of in my sushi... but my boyfriend loves them so we went for their crispy scallop special that night. OH.EM.GEE. these were the best scallops I've ever had - and the dish definitely became my favorite of the night! The scallops were cooked perfectly - not a hint of rubberiness, just perfect/delicate break-with-your-fork butteriness. They sat in a pool of this most devine heart-clenching sauce, with a small mound of micro-greens to cut the butteriness... each bite was surreal. If you happen to be at The House when this is on the menu - GET IT; you'll thank me later... 5 stars.\n\nSpecial Appetizer; Big Eye Tuna sashimi (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZoZjbOYR-apY8XvommlNUA?select=SFv4ba3WHk_rNhltYwrtYA)\nIt was difficult to navigate our way through this dish, but it was enjoyable - hard to compete with coming after the scallops though... 3.5 stars.\n\nSpecial Request; Seasonal Fish (Mahi Mahi) w/ Wasabi Noodles (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZoZjbOYR-apY8XvommlNUA?select=ueV5otOBb6fXS9bQOH7tBQ)\nYESSSSS, they take special requests! I don't remember how they said they were serving their seasonal fish that night, but it wasn't with their wasabi noodles... so we kindly asked if they would make it like so, and they said yes - yay! The mahi mahi was cooked perfectly, and topped with a nice and tangy salad of pickled onions - which I wish there was more of -  helped to cut the butteriness of the dish. The noodles (udon style) were the perfect thickness and cooked just right, though the taste of wasabi was not very prevalent - A-OK with me, since I'm too weak-sauce for strong wasabi taste anyway, but it did make the noodles less impression-lasting. They also gave us some of their ginger soy sauce (which typically comes with their sea bass w/ wasabi noodles dish) on the side, even though it was totally unneeded since the dish was already perfectly seasoned/sauced. Overall a great LARGE dish, perfect to share between 2-3 people, though nothing extraordinary that I felt I couldn't find anywhere else... 4 stars.\n\nI am typically wary of Asian Fusion, but this was overall a great experience with exceptionally prepared food and caring/accommodating service. Prices are reasonable for the size and quality, plus atmosphere is dim and easy going - perfect for dates or just nights out. I can't wait to come back - I really want to try their deep-fried chicken liver salad and their lunch menu, unagi avocado sandwich :D", "author": "Lana N."}

The wasabi noodles was interesting as the steak was cooked beautifully but the sea bass, really?  If this is one of the items that San Franciscans think its amazing, I have no words to say.  The best dish all nite was the daily special appetizer of seared scallops w. a lemon ponzu vinaigrette.  SOOOO good, we ordered another.  I was really excited for this meal but the culmination of the whole night made me disappointed from the debbie downer waitress to rushed service to bad sake to overrated food.   I just wanted to get out ASAP.  The main issue I have w. this place is the menu takes on this modern and pretentious appeal but the ambiance and understaffed service negates the whole theme.", "author": "Ricky C."}

I called in and the only reservation they had was for 10pm.  We walked by to see what the estimated wait time would be and we were told about 30-45 minutes.  Perfect timing for us to go home, drop off our things and come back out.  We stood at the door for less than a minute before they seated us.  This was probably my 4th time dining here.  I am always happy with the service and their knowledge of the food.  The servers always have the specials memorized (usually a list of 4 starters and 3 entrees).\n\nSTARTER:  We choose the ahi tuna tartare for our starter.  It was okay.  I love the roasted nori chips that it came on.  Should have tried the kobe steak tartare instead, but I kept thinking that I'd rather go back to BIX for a great steak tartare.\n\nENTREE:  The first 3 times I always had the black cod.  It's THAT GOOD.  But then they didn't mention it as a special tonight so it provided me with the opportunity to try something different.  I decided to try their warm wasabi house noodles with the angus flatiron steak.  I really enjoyed the little spicy taste that came with the wasabi noodles and the steak was cooked perfectly.  My sister had the halibut in a curry sauce.  She liked it a lot, especially the garnish on top.  It was like fried shredded carrots or something.\n\nDESSERT:  We shared the coconut creme brulee with passion fruit puree and the chocolate espresso bread pudding with vanilla ice cream.  The coconut creme brulee was divine.  Super creamy, which went great with the layer of crunchy sugar.  I personally could have done without the passion fruit puree, but it's perfect for those who like tart desserts.  The bread pudding was more like a cake.  It was super soft and went well with the vanilla ice cream.\n\nReservations are a must for larger groups.  If you don't have reservations and have a party of 2-4, I recommend to walk in, leave your name and number (usually a 30-60 minute wait) head up to the King of Thai on the corner and enjoy some $2 draft beers or $6 shots/cocktails while you wait.", "author": "Stephanie C."}

I hate eating at a restaurant and feeling like my meal is a small piece of art, with 3 dots of sauce and a splash of this and a smudge of that with a tiny piece of meat in the center that i'm suppose to call my main course.  With that said, the dishes at The House are not only beautifully presented, but generously portioned as well; imagine that! \n\nAppetizers: $6-12 \n\nI highly recommend the crab cake and the oysters if they have them \n\nEntree: $14-22 \n\nThe pork chops w/ pomegranate sauce is amazing, i'm not a fan of ordering pork chops, but the pork chop at The House is extremely tender, melt in your mouth. quite amazing.\n\nI usually order the steak whenever i come and it never disappoints, comes out perfect medium rare just the way i ordered it, very flavorful with a great crust on it.  perfection, and for about $25 you can't go wrong. \n\nI always have a great experience whenever i come to The House and i try to take my friends whenever i get the opportunity.  You not only leave full and satisfied, but you won't have to pick up three extra shifts just to pay it off.  Perfect location to go out after dinner also. 5 solid stars!", "author": "Randy N."}

This place has great food and that's what i love, great food. \nKobe beef with black truffle reduction- Superb! Steak was cooked perfectly and the flavor of the steak was great and the truffle reduction matched the steak with just the right flavor, the mashed potato was a bit dry and lacked thoughtfulness.\nWasabi Noodle with Flatiron steak- Awesome! Steak was cooked well and the wasabit noodle is one of the best items at the place, not too spicy and the flavoris very special.\nThe appetizers were also very good.\nI would say try everything if you had enough people, each item has its unique strengths, depending on your likings.\n\nThe only half star is the location and size.

Secondly I've been here a couple of times and there are always bums and weird people walking around, obviously because its located near a filthy area. Lastly they included gratuities in the bill for a group of 6 people.

Everything from the presentation of the food to the quantities to the taste was impressive. \n\nI went with a group of friends; we were 6 altogether. So we got to sample quite a few dishes. We started with 2 appetizers: blue lake bean tempura with pickled ginger soy and the soft shell crab tempura (a special not on the menu). Both were yummy, yet if I had to pick one it would be the bean tempura. The crab tempura may have been a little hard to share because there were 6 of us. \n\nI ordered skate as my main dish, which came with cauliflower and mashed potatoes. I ate every last bite of this dish! It was excellent. Note: it was a special that night and not on the regular menu. My friends ordered: the mushroom rice with grilled prawns, scallops with orzo (special), and three ordered the grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy. I got to sample each of these dishes. The sea bass was \"melt in your mouth\" delicious. The scallops, which is one of my favorite sea food dishes, were wonderful as well. And you can't go wrong with the prawns.\n\nFinally, we ordered 2 desserts. Yea, we had a feast! We ordered the apple pie and the chocolate cake with coffee ice cream on top. Our table favored the warm apple pie. Wow, I'm still thinking about it!\n\nOnly one minor, yet not such a big deal, issue, is that we were seated later than our reservation, which was at 8:30PM (on a Saturday).

What a wonderful find...thank you fellow yelpers!! Be warned - this place is small and a little cramped & reservations are a must. Came here Saturday night & the place was packed but was pleased that we were seated right away. I have to say the service throughout was also excellent which amazed me since the place was packed - they are doing alot of things right it seems...\n\nThey brought out some pickled cucumbers to start off with. We decided to skip the alcohol and try the lychee ice tea and found it very refreshing. For starters we shared the shrimp & chive dumplings and the deep-fried salmon roll. I am not a huge shrimp fan but still enjoyed the dumplings - the chive was a bonus. The salmon roll on the other hand...oh wow so good!! They do not skimp on the salmon but watch out for the Chinese hot mustard sauce...that hit me when I dipped too much of the roll in it.\n\nFor dinner we narrowed down to the glazed salmon in the sake broth & the grilled sea bass. I was craving noodles and it totally made my night when the server said the sea bass comes with either garlic noodles or rice...awesome!! The sea bass was just cooked perfectly - soft, moist, and just flaked with the fork. The cooks definitely know how to make this right!! The green beans were cooked well - not overdone so had a nice crunch & very flavorful. The salmon was also very good. The broth though has a nice spicy kick to it - must have some chili flakes in there. We could taste the chili but it definitely was mild enough to not overpower the dish. \n\nAnd then yummy dessert - so many looked good but we finally picked the coconut cr\u00e8me brulee w/ passion fruit puree.

I thought their lunch was good, but their dinner blew me away. I can seriously say this was one of the best meals of my life. That may not mean much, but it does to me. Also, please note that I do not normally order fish at restaurants unless it is battered and fried. The House has changed the way I look at fish. I love it now!\n\nEverything I tasted was devine. The caesar salad with crispy scallops was the best salad I've had in a while. I love how they used the scallops as croutons! I even had a couple of raw oysters, which to me, is a HUGE deal. The spicy cilantro vinegarette was the perfect accompaniment for the raw oysters. For my entree I had the black cod special. It was pan roasted to perfection with a crispy layer on top and nice flaky fish inside. The miso sauce was scrumptious. I wanted to lick the plate clean! I also loved the idea of serving a California roll with the cod. Everything on the plate was fantastic! \n\nTips: make an early reservation on a Saturday evening (5pm) and you won't have to wait at all. The service was quick but not rushed. If you want to go all out, you will pay the price but it's worth every penny. You could easily experience The House on a budget. Share an appetizer (the caesar salad or the salmon rolls), get your own entree and share a dessert (the truffle cake is a MUST). \n\nI told my BF that I would give up eating out all month in exchange for going to The House once a month. It was that serious.", "author": "Joshua C."}

I've definitely had much better sea bass elsewhere, cooked similarly with Asian ingredients. \n\nthe boy had a grilled rib-eye steak, medium rare.  the cut of beef was surprisingly thin and not so surprising, mostly fat which was very hard to eat...would have been very nice flavors with a filet or another thick cut of meat. \n\nthe wait was considerably 15-20 minutes even with reservations....which was also kind of annoying.  however, when we were dining we were never once rushed, which I can definitely appreciate.\n\nsummary: overrated", "author": "Brittany H."}

I believe my cousin took me here once a long time ago and I was still a kid so didn't really know what I was eating but man have I been missing out all these years. \n\nThe three of us ordered the mussels for appetizer, pork tenderloin, sea bass, and seared ahi tuna. ALL THREE DISHES WERE so delicious! I would say the tuna was best, pork tenderloin and sea bass last. But don't get me wrong it was still delicious it was just those two are a better choice. The tuna came in a perfect seared, I'm usually a huge fan of raw fish only, but this time it was seared so wonderfully I didn't mind it at all. The sauce that it came in was super amazing. I wish they would just sell that. The tuna came with rice and spinach which was also very delicious. The tenderloin was super juicy. That sauce again, soooo delicious! The sea bass, was burnt a little according to the bestie, but I thought it was fine. The soy sauce thing was yummy as well. \n\nTheir sauces make all their dishes super delightful. \n\nAfter that we all shared a coconut creme brulee. It was a little too creamy but still good. no coconut taste tho, but I didn't mind that very much, I actually didn't want it to begin with. Haha \n\nThe only bad thing was they were serving and taking away things a little too quickly, as if they were trying to rush us out of there or something, even though there were spaces available. I don't know if that's just how they want to be efficient, but I don't like the feeling of being rushed. For instance, I didn't even finish my mussel and they took away all the plates, so I felt like I had to shove it down my throat. But other than that the food was amazing. \n\nwill definitely come back, I want to try the wasabi noodles!", "author": "Christina N."}

Then the main dishes, I got the Cod, my BF got the steak, the parents got sea bass and salmon.  Same thing, the plates were clean and we all tried each others dishes and were absolutely blown away.  Some places just know what they're doing.  It's very rare that the service is great, all the dishes are amazing followed by dessert.  \n\nOf course I got the dessert with the candle, and even that was amazing, the chocolate cake was just right, not overly sweet or rich and a nice cleanse to my palette.  \n\nNeedless to say I'm coming back and hopefully soon:)  \n\nReservations essential!", "author": "Inga W."}

It's hard to believe that this San Francisco hot spot is a family run operation. Just order whatever catches your fancy, and you really can't go wrong. I brought my mom and brother here when I went back to the Bay to visit and my brother said that it was the best restaurant he's ever been to. The food and the service were both impeccable. Truly one of the best restaurant experiences I've ever had!\n\nJust make sure you make a reservation, because as you can see by the reviews, this place is POPULAR. Also, make the appropriate travel arrangements because there isn't much parking nearby and the small valet lot down the street tends to fill up fast. If you don't mind the walk (and mind you, after this delectable meal,  you'll probably need the exercise anyways) it's only about a 15-20 minute stroll from the Union Station BART stop.", "author": "Gerald L."}

I've been here for 4 times before and the taste and presentation is out of the ball park, but this time, I went with my boyfriend hoping to impress, The House disappointed me. We had the tuna tartare and it was a little watery, maybe the chef didn't dry off all the water that was with the fish when they were washing it, but I never tasted their tartare to be so bad. We got the NY steak and the pork chop. NY steak was slice in a triangular way where one side was thinner than the other, The thicker side of the steak was great but not so much the dry thin layer. C'mon, shouldn't they know what a good steak is about even though it's Asian Fusion?!? The pork chop didn't disappoint since it's always the signature thing they have. IT was a little overcook from what I remember from the last time I had it but nonetheless, still very juicy in the center. \n\nThe one star knock off was... We were there at 6 knowing it'll be jammed pack any later... The waitress told us that we can sit but they need the table back in an hour. I'm thought it was rude for them to tell us that but I guess better informing us before than trying to give bad customer service like we're being rush. From what I just read on the side, the waitress does always seem stress. C'mon, I believed she worked there for a while and she's always just stressed out.

They definitely maximize the space usage.\n\nI ordered the tuna tartare, a sashimi dish, and the salmon rools for the appetizers! Both were very refreshing.\n\nWhile the wine list is quite extensive for a small fusion restaurant, the quality of the wines could use some refinement. \n\nThe tuna tartare was really amazing and unique. It may even be better than Morimoto's in Napa. The chips that came with the tuna were delightful.\n\nThe Sea Bass was exceptional: buttery, and melts in your mouth. It came with wasabi noodles that were a bit too salty.\n\nWhile most people do not order the pork chop at a nice restaurant, I beg you to try it! It was the most delicately cooked piece of meat that I have eaten. The sauce blends all the flavors together well and everything falls into place when you put everything in your mouth.\n\nThe desserts were typical, and probably need some work.

Once for dinner and again the next day for lunch since they ran out of the Pork Chops that I wanted. The fact that we went back the second day is a testament to how good this restaurant is. \n\nFirst of all, make sure you have reservations for dinner. The place is TINY and always packed. There is nowhere to comfortably wait either so you'll be awkwardly standing over someone else eating or getting hit by the door. Otherwise you can always stand outside. \n\nPrice: On a generic level, it's spendy for your typical Chinese meal, but this isn't typical and it's worth it.\n\nAtmosphere: The place is small and very intimate which can translate to being kind of loud but it's not bad. I love that it's not hoity toity. No flash, just good food.\n\nDress: Casual. Jeans and a nice t-shirt will suffice. If you're self conscious, go with jeans and a polo and you'll be good.\n\n// GET IT:\n\nAHI TUNA TARTARE WITH ROASTED NORI CHIPS bursting with flavor and perfect combo of tender and crunchy. If you normally like tuna tartare this is a no brainier. Probably my favorite of the night. \n\nMUSHROOM RICE WITH GRILLED PRAWNS The rice is more like a risotto with an awesome truffle accent. Truffle fans will enjoy this. The prawns were good as well but the mushroom rice is the highlight in his dish. Never had anything like it. \n\n// IF THOSE TOP TWO THINGS AREN'T YOUR THING, GET THIS:\n\nGRILLED SEA BASS WITH GARLIC GINGER SOY the sea bass was grilled nicely and left the middle tender and buttery. My wife got this but I liked my mushroom rice more. We got the garlic noodles with it which were great and I wish there was more of it. I think you can get something else other than the garlic noodles. Maybe a salad but I'm not positive about that. \n\n// IF YOU'RE HUNGRY GET THIS TOO (they're good but otherwise, you're not missing out too much):\n\nWHITE SHRIMP AND CHINESE CHIVE DUMPLINGS were good but nothing crazy unique. You've probably had a dumpling like this before but sometimes you just want a dumpling and this will satisfy your craving. \n\nMAINE CRAB CAKE WITH PICKLED GINGER REMOULADE was fresh and quality crab meat. Crab cakes can get dense, too rich and heavy but these were fresh with light ingredients. The remoulade sauce was good as well. At the end of the day, nothing crazy.\n\nNeedless to say, we'll be back. Look at that, i said it anyway!", "author": "Anthony N."}

The seating arrangement next to us had the 3rd person sitting with the back almost touching our table. \nIt gets a little loud in the restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant was put together well though, very neat and simple. My boyfriend commented on how they had their picture frames sunken into the wall. \n\nWe had service immediately, and were told the specials of the day. \n\nWe tried Seared Scallops for a small plate. It was one special of the day. It was good, and sweet. \n\nThen we had Deep Fried Salmon rolls. These were delicious like other yelpers have said. I could eat these everyday! ( Although, that might not be very healthy)\n\nAnd raw oysters. It came with a cilantro mignonette sauce, which I didn't think was very special compared to any other mignonette on oysters. \n\nI had the grilled ahi tuna for my main dish, and my boyfriend had the kobe steak with mashed potatoes and mushrooms, which was another special of the day. \nBoth of our meals were delicious and we ate them all up! Both were nice and rare. \n\nAnd everything was presented very beautifully.\n\nWe also had some sake to drink, with demon in the name. I can't remember the exact name of it, but it was very light and easy to drink. \n\nPeople say that this place is expensive but for just two people, I thought it was fine.

Super tender but with a nice charred/crisp crust to it... Divine!\n\nI have to come back and try out some of the other dishes. They all looked so intriguing!

Everyone is super attentive and accommodating \n\nAmbiance...Relaxed but fun. This is the perfect place for a nice dinner with a date or a night out with some friends\n\nPrice....Amazing. For the quality of the food and service I would easily pay 5 bucks more per dish. But I dont have to! Which is why this place would get 6 stars if it could.\n\nAnd finally the food...oh the food here. If anything in this world could be definitively labeled asian fusion it would be the food here. The food is smart and adventurous but has just enough familiar elements to make you feel comfortable. The ahi tartare and salmon egg rolls are amazing. The tuna is fresh as is it gets and the salmon in the egg rolls is perfectly fried leaving the center just slightly raw. And now to the star dish....\n\nThe Niman Ranch Kurobata Pork Chop with Pomegranate Currant Sauce. It's almost too good. Seriously. The pork chop is THE most tender, and flavorful pork chop you might ever have. EVER. It's how a pork chop should be. My mom, love you mom, made the driest pork chops known to man so I was pretty skeptical about having it. But man oh man was it worth the risk. The pomegranate currant sauce is THE best sauce I have had in my entire life. It's sweet, sour, savory, tangy, and has the smoothest finish of any sauce, anywhere. You could put it on a shoe and it would still be delicious. If there is one thing I want to achieve in my life in terms of culinary skill it is to make this sauce one day.\n\nSo do you get the picture? COME HERE. Try this place out.

Since I know I am the Alpha male I just try to be as polite as possible since I do not want to be kicked out of this restaurant.  Her body language and tone of voice doesn't give me the warm fuzzies.  Especially when she says \"Do you want to see my appointment book!!!?\".  Bad Karma #1. \n\nI ordered the Mussels and the Sea Bass for my entree.  The mussels were plated beautifully with a white sliced radish with caviar on top.  It looked terrific.  First byte of the mussels were good it tasted plump and good flavor.  Then Bad Karma #2 struck.

Both are very common within the realm of restaurant ingredients...but seldom are these ingredients turned into something so delicious for the price point of The House. My rib-eye was cooked precisely as requested (med-rare). The aromas and flavors that came from this one piece of meat were incredible to say the least. My girlfriend's grilled sea-bass was buttery and full of flavor as well. \n\nSince we weren't disappointed yet, we decided hey, why not get some dessert? So dessert we got. Apple Crumb pie ala mode and creme brulee were our choice of the night and I must say they did not disappoint. These dishes weren't done extra fancy or anything, but what made them amazing was the fact that the chef's didn't take the term dessert as an excuse to create a dish able to resuscitate a Type 2 diabetic. Harmony was the game-plan and it shone through time and time again in the dishes. Whether this theme is purposeful or not, I will need to find out with more visits in the future.\n\nIf I have any complaints, it would not be for the food, or the service. The wait staff here, as busy as they are, apparently can read minds and take care of whatever needs to be done efficiently and without asking. At the same time, they are not so 'attentive' as to come off intrusive...because god knows it would take a lot to separate me and any food placed in front of me from here. About my complaint; well this place can get a bit crowded, and because of that also bit too cozy and warm. Don't be surprised if you knock elbows or somebody's behind as they walk by.

Can I say that they were both outstanding. I've never had mussels as delicious and soft and delicate like this one. Usually, I am kind of hesitant with ordering seafood when I'm dining out, but I am more than glad that I took a chance on these steamed mussels. It literally melts in your mouth. That was finished in less than 3 minutes!\nThe ribeye- oh, where should I start? I am a meat and steak lover, had steak/beef almost everywhere you can imagine, but here, here is different. The ribeye was so soft and moist (had it well-done) and just melted away on my tongue. How else can I describe it? It was the best piece of meat I've ever had. \n\nMy bf had the fried salmon rolls ($10) and he loved it. I, however, had a taste and didn't like it much. It wasn't bad, but TO ME, it tasted like any other salmon, but maybe because I am not a fan of salmon. My bf called me \"F*ing crazy\" when I told him how I felt about it som don't let my opinion of the salmon stop you from trying it.\n\nCame in for lunch the other day and had the flat iron steak ($15) that came with mustard greens, mashed potatoes and some kind of delicious sauce. Hands down, my favortie dish! I admit, at first my heaert sank when I realized that the steak was sliced instead of whole because I figured it'll be dry. However, as soon as I stabbed my knife and fork in it, my heart was up and pumping again! So delicious and again, it just melted in my mouth. So tender and juicy and the sauce, the mashed, and the greens just compliments it. \n\nThe bf has the pork loin sandwich ($9) which he said was good, but not great... obviously, because he digged right in my plate as soon as he was finished with his. \n\nI've been dying to try the grilled sea bass($25-27) which LOOKED super delish.\n\nNOTE: Highly recommend that you make reservations before you come or else you'll be drooling over people's food while waiting.", "author": "Charisma C."}

Slice diagonally before serving for a stunning presentation. Spicy mustard, crunchy seaweed, and juicy salmon makes this an instant favorite. \n\nUni Clam Chowder:\nAs a disclaimer, I like the earthy sweet taste of uni. As the waitress(who's awesome) put it, it's not going to change your mind about uni, but if you like it, this dish is for you. \n\nThe uni goes phenomenally well with the clam chowder, I'm amazed at how well the two flavors go together. All the other ingredients are fresh and add different perspectives to the soup. When I bit into one of the small potato bits, I finally realized how much a simple potato can add to a dish\n\nGrilled Seabass with Garlic Ginger Soy:\nThe seabass was well seasoned on it's own, so you must have some of it without the sauce first. However, once you dip it in the garlic ginger soy sauce, you really taste how the two flavors combine (like that scene in Ratatouille). Awesome!!!\n\nGrilled Chinese Chicken Salad with Soy Vinaigrette:\nNormally, I don't like salads, but the Asian-style grilled chicken goes superbly with the soy vinaigrette.

Even after reading the not-so-good reviews, my husband,guest and I still decided to go.  THE FOOD IS AMAZING.  REally really great.  The reviews are accurate in saying that the place is really small and the furniture is cheap, but who cares?  I would do the same thing if I had a restaurant like this.  The food speaks for itself.  \n\nThe only downside I see is that the meals are small.  So for my husband, he was still hungry and the place isn't cheap so it's not easy to just order something else.", "author": "Jeanette M."}

I also took an old friend here while he was visiting from LA.  He is a graduate of Le Cordon Bleu Pasadena. He also had a great experience. \n\nA few things:\n1. The food is fresh and each core entr\u00e9e item has 2 complimentary sides included on the plate that serve your taste buds well. For the foodies, I suggest tasting each item individually then all three together.  The individual taste and the blended taste are so different, but it's a great experience to say the least. \n\n2. The presentation of the food is pretty amazing. It not only taste fabulous, it's food art in my eyes.  \n\n3. Another great \"date\" spot. \n\n4. The menu is small and controlled. The chefs know what they are doing and have mastered the menu. Since the menu is small and mastered, you are going to get a good meal out of this place no matter what you order. \n\n5. The space is very intimate, so if you are not a fan of tight seating, then I highly suggest getting over your phobia. The food is worth a visit. \n\nMy only suggestion: Make reservations and don't be late. If you are running late, call in advanced. They are pretty accommodating.  This place is always crowded hence the location and the quality of food. At least on the weekends.  \n\nEnjoy.", "author": "Rox T."}

There is nothing fancy or makes it stand out that I would have this dish again.

With my visiting girlfriend from Miami, I finally had an excuse to go and try The House.\n\nFirst off, the food is delicious, but the service sucks.  There were two four person tables available the entire time, but the hostess let my date and I (who had reservations) just wait and stand for about half an hour before we got seated.  There was nobody waiting except for us.\n\nNext, it was a sprint.  They literally hurried all the dishes off to us and I felt like I was running a 100 yard dash rather than eating at a fancy restaurant.  I even purchased a bottle of wine so they would slow down, but they literally shoved the food and the bottle down my throat.  I felt like I was back in my college days chugging Franzia at the house.\n\nFinally, the food is great.  BEST SEA BASS I HAVE EVER EATEN.  I also had the steak, which also was so tasty, but the SEA BASS.  If only they deliver, and I could get it to go.  It's pretty tasty, but definitely not worth the service, so that is probably my last bite.  \n\nI gave it 4 stars because everyone should go and try the sea bass once, as it is life-altering, but makes you realize how much service affects your mood sometimes.", "author": "Min P."}

The restaurant itself is small but that doesn't bother me. As long as it's clean and comfortable and the foods good I can care less of its size.\n\nThe menu was short and sweet just like how all menus should be. I hate long menus with millions of items, a nice restaurant will always have a short menu with just enough description on each item to make you salivate.\n\nI went with 3 other friends and ordered the fried green beans to start off with which was good, anything fried is always good. Although I did enjoy the dipping sauce that came with it- a spicey aoli mixture. We each also got complimentary scallops from the chef and it was pretty divine. The scallop was cooked perfectly with all the perfect spices and sauces complimenting it.\n\nMy entr\u00e9e was the chicken breast topped with truffle mushrooms. \nChicken was cooked the way I liked it-  not overcooked, lots of moisture and seasoned well. Truffle is the key to my heart, it should be the the key to human kind's heart. We'd be so fuckin happy if a truffle could lead to world peace. Anyway my plate fell together like a piece of art. I wouldn't have changed a damn thing.\n\nI also tried my friend's dishes, a bite of the salmon- delicious sitting on the best broth/sauce. The wasabi noodles was brilliant. The piece of steak I tried was juicy, cooked just right.  Keep in mind all these dishes come with sauces and seasoning that you will be not be able to figure out. I kind of wanted to go to the bathroom about 5 times so I can see how they prepared everything haha.\n\nDessert: Creme Brulee- One of the best creme brulee's I've ever had! Perfect creme texture and the caramelized sugar/orange top was such an originally delightful touch.\n\nOverall, I love this place like I knew I would. Worth every one of my college pennies.", "author": "Vicki B."}

I really liked the salmon rolls, the ahi tuna tartar with roasted nori chips, the unagi on rice, and the flank steak.  Totally want to try the sea bass next time.\n- Non-alcoholic drinks: The lycee iced tea was quite good with free refills.  There were many interesting hot teas on the menu too I was tempted by, including the cool tea that blooms into a flower inside your cup.  All this stuff was really affordable ($2-5).\n\nUNSPIFFY FOOD:\n- Too many dishes used a similar wasabi-based sauce.  I'm a huge wasabi fan but you can only have so much of it before it starts feeling gimmicky.\n- I didn't really like the green bean tempura appetizer the waitress recommended as \"easy to share\".  First it was arranged in a Jenga arrangement (remember that game?) with the sauce container underneath so there was really no way to access the sauce without knocking all the beans over.  Plus, you know how when you go to a Japanese restaurant and you order a bento box with tempura and the suckiest pieces are always the veggies at the end?  Yeah, this was like that only the whole thing was green beans.\n- The portion size was probably a bit too generous on the entrees.  It was an ordeal to finish my entree.  I would have preferred family-style or tapas-style and the opportunity to sample more dishes.\n\nCOOL:\n- The paper placemat was cute with a little house punched into it.\n- Really efficient and friendly service.  They were very accommodating of our large group.\n- Very cozy seating and ambiance.\n\nLAME:\n- They were crowded and we were strongly encouraged to vacate our table after the check arrive, which sort of sucked since we were mid-conversation.\n- It would have been nice to have the specials written somewhere on a blackboard or on a piece of paper.  Even the waitress had to reference her notes to remember them all.\n- It was uncomfortably cold in the restaurant.  Several members of our party kept jackets on.\n- Parking in this neighborhood is terrible though there's a garage about a block away.\n\nI probably wouldn't plan a trip back to The House, but I do recommend checking it out at least once.", "author": "Wayne K."}

It was definitely not the healthiest thing to eat, but it just melts in your mouth.  So good!\n\nFor a main course, I selected the sole, while my friends ordered the yellow tail hibachi and the ahi tuna.  Each plate arrived in a beautiful arrangement on the plate, with colors that jumped out right at you.  My sole was cooked perfectly, and the mashed potatoes underneath were devoured quickly.  My friends each enjoyed their dishes as well.  Now, it was time for dessert.\n\nOne of my friends was a pastry chef, so she was particularly excited.  She selected the creme brulee, while my other friend went with the red velvet cake.  I chose the apple cobbler (without the \"a la mode\" since I'm a lactard).  My apple cobbler was solid, while my friends each very much enjoyed their respective desserts.  Being a pastry chef, I trusted my one friend when she said the creme brulee was delicious.\n\nWe never felt rushed at any point.  In fact, the table of 3 older ladies next to us received their check a few minutes after we sat down and only left 5 minutes before we paid out.  It was clear that this was a restaurant that wanted each party to enjoy their meal to the fullest, even if there were a few folks waiting to be seated.  After tax and tip, we spent about $52 a person... definitely reasonable for a good meal, considering all of the food we ordered.\n\nI'll be back... I think I may have a new favorite restaurant in SF!", "author": "Kenny L."}

They don't have a bunch of food on their menu but everything they have is delicious! I came here for my anniversary with my husband and I had the sea bass while he had the ribeye. The two entrees were soo yummy. They cook the steak exactly how we want it, which is medium rare. It's literally the best sea bass I've ever had along with their garlic noodles. The only thing that didn't taste all that great was the appetizer mussels. Definitely make reservation in advance because it's always a full house!!", "author": "Trang L."}

Our waiter was 100% on top of his service and very personable, friendly and helpful with his suggestions. \n\nBut I'm sorry, I can't give it 5 stars and hold to a strong 3.5. While the restaurant is clean, personable and relatively quiet considering the small space, there are a few things that took off the edge. \n\nI also don't eat seafood and my boyfriend opted for pork instead of seafood at last minute, so the menu was a bit limiting in that sense. Prices for appetizers and their size were decent, though! \n\nMy steak was flavored well with teriyaki, but wasn't as rare as I would have liked for it to be and my potatoes were kind of flavorless for being garlic mash. His Kurobuta pork was more on a bbq style side, which is odd considering the nature of this pig. Kurobuta means \"black pig\" in Japanese, which is a rare type of British pig that is on par with Kobe beef in terms of its stature in the meat world. That being said, a lot of asian fusion restaurants that feature this like the mark-up capabilities and this is truly a tender pig. These guys did a pretty good job with getting across the tender layers with a crispy outside layer, but in terms of meat flavor, Yoshi's preparation was spot on in comparison. \n\nFor dessert, an apple crumble for my man and cheesecake for me. I went with our waiter's suggestion over the coconut creme brulee with passionfruit compote, which sounded exotically appealing, and it was a very simple, classic dessert. I guess I wanted more \"umph\" and should have taken the leap with the creme brulee. I did also end up with an excellent chardonnay, which is rare as most chards are too dry for my tastes. \n\nMostly, it was the table we were seated at that took things down the most. Behind the host stand by the door, which meant my boyfriend was feeling cramped by waiting customers and my feet were freezing from the draft coming in underneath the divider. So try to avoid sitting here; I'm sure this would have easily take the edge off and lead to a happy 4+ rating!", "author": "Alita M."}

Presentation of food is nice though..too bad it's not as tasty as it looks. Shared the following 3 appetizers & 1 main course:\n\nRoasted unagi (eel) with avocado sushi rice(3.5 stars): Typical sushi you can get at any restaurant.  I liked how the bonito flakes are \"moving\" on top when they bring it out to you.  \"Safe\" dish b/c it's very typical.\n\nDeep-fried salmon roll (2 stars):  Did not particularly like this one..maybe wasn't a fan of the cooked salmon (bit dry)?  Wasn't bad...but wasn't good either.  Skip this dish.\n\nSoftshell Crab (3 stars): Also very typical.  Good, but nothing special.  Also served with small portion of noodles.  Nice presentation though...there are these fried \"wonton-stick\" things that stick out of the crab that give it a tree-like look.  \n\nGrilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy (4 stars):  Best thing I ate out of the 4 dishes.  Good BUT it still isn't anything to rave about.  Sea bass was nice & buttery, and I liked the green beans that came with it.  It is also served w/ Udon noodles I believe. It's already well seasoned & salty enough, so even though they give you extra sauce on the side, you won't be needing it.", "author": "Christine V."}

It is located in the artsy district surrounded by restaurants, strip joints, and classical bookstores. The place was packed and there was no room to wait. The space is pretty small which is why you feel like a sardine. Let's just say you get to know who you are sitting next to very well as you are basically sitting on top of them. This makes it easy to steal a few bites of their food when they aren't paying attention (jk I did not commit this act, though I was tempted). For appetizers we started off with the fried salmon rolls. Deeply fried and crunchy on the outside, but soft and juicy on the inside, with an excellent sauce. I had the steak and my bf had the chicken. We were both fighting for the steak, but since I got to choose the place, I won. Both were very delicious. The steak was perfect, incredibly succulent.

This is some of my favorites.  I would keep the party size small, since they don't have a lot of tables for large parties.  Once went with a party of 6 and got squeezes into a 4 person table.\n\nAppetizers:\nDeep fried salmon rolls: filling and skin ratio is good, pretty generous with the salmon.  \nKurobuta Pork cheek buns: devoured within minutes, wish there were more.\nTuna tartare: flavors are simple and straight to the point.\n\nEntrees:\nPomegranate Currant Porkchops: The dish that won me over, I believe this is the perfect example of asian fusion.  The porkchop has a hint of the spices and flavor that my mom use to make her porkchops and the pomegranate give it that hint of acid and sweetness.  Must try!\nSea Bass: my second favorite dish, the noodles it comes with..drool..and the vegetable has been different each time I've gotten it\nMiso Cod: The California rolls that come with it are very interesting, definitely the only time I've seen them served like that.  Also yummy.\n\nUnfortunately their desserts aren't that memorable.

I thought it would be somewhat fancy but lo and behold, it's a pretty cramped restaurant with your standard wooden tables at Asian restaurants but with fancy ceiling lights that provide an ambient setting. I would have to say the restaurant is a little too dark though. My mom had to whip out her iPhone flashlight to read the menu. Overall, I would have to say that they know how to cook their meat and their seafood. From their fried salmon rolls to their pork chop to their skirt steak to their shrimp, they really cook it perfectly, keeping everything perfectly succulent. My only complaint of their food is that it feels a little too heavy and salty. My mom commented in the middle of the meal, \"we should have ordered rice!\" even though one of our plates was a mushroom rice and the other was a noodle dish. The flavors were just a little too salty for real. I would have to say the highlights of my meal were the fried salmon rolls and the house wasabi noodles with skirt steak. The salmon rolls were pure genius - salmon wrapped in seaweed then finished off egg roll style, just so some of the salmon is cooked while the inside is raw. The house noodles had a really nice texture and had just a hint of wasabi and paired well with the perfectly cooked steak. For dessert, we had the chocolate truffle cake and the mango tapioca. Both were good - the cake was nice and dense and the tapioca was chilled and refreshing though I wish there was more mango flavor!

One friend made reservations and off we were!\n\nLuckily, the stars were aligned that night and we ended up finding a parking spot half a block away.

The scallops were seared perfectly and the sauce and greens all went together beautifully.\n- Deep-fried chicken liver with spring greens: I'd never had a liver salad before but this was pretty good. Luckily a few of my friends liked liver as well, as this was a bit large to eat by yourself.\n- Tuna tartare: I wasn't too impressed; the wasabi taste kind of overpowered it.\n\nEntrees (the good thing about dining with others is that you can try more stuff. Yay!):\n- Grilled sea bass with noodles: THIS HAS RUINED ME. I've never seen a piece of fish that thick cooked to such perfection. I'm not even kidding, this is the BEST sea bass I've EVER had.  You don't even need the sauce; it's THAT good. It has a nice seared crust as well. The noodles that go with it are a bit greasy, but flavorwise, everything goes really well together.\n- American Kobe flank steak with black truffle sauce and mashed potatoes (special): this was my husband's dish. When our server set it down, the aroma floated around the table and we made a collective \"OoOoo.\" Cooked to a perfect medium rare and sooo soft.\n- Kurobuta pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce: I did not expect this to be as good as it was.

I'm definitely ordering this the next time we eat here.\n\nThe portions are a good size; we left full but not about to bust open our pants.

Asian Fusion usually translates to something cooked improperly and marinated with ginger, miso, soy, or sesame. So when my mom told me about this place, I had my doubts.

Their version of Asian fusion is Asian ingredients cooked in a Western way, and served with Asian speediness. \n\nMy favorite dish here is the pork chop. It has so many flavors! It's brined, with a sweet fruity sauce that's also tangy. It's Asian, it's American, it's everything! \n\nMake sure you listen to their specials list every time you go in, although the waiters/tresses have a tendency to stare at the wall while trying to remember what their specials are.

Tonight I came with three foodie family members who were in town visiting from the Philippines. \n\nNow I rarely take the time to write reviews, unless I've had an especially good or bad experience at a place. Tonight at The House was DELICIOUS as always, BUT our waitress was probably the worst I've had in my 7 years living in the bay area.\n\nShe was extremely rude to us from the start. She would roll her eyes when my family, who have filipino accents, asked questions about the specials. Funny.. has she not had to deal with foreigners before, being in north beach and all?  \n\nWe tried our very best to be patient despite her EXTREMELY HOSTILE demeanor but nothing we did seemed to be enough to change her mood. We ordered a ton of food and wine and tried to ignore her awful manner. Did she not want us to order more?? I think we were way too patient for the kind of treatment we received. I don't have time to be more descriptive here and because I have been a fan of this place for a long time I will just say that you will probably have a great meal there if you manage to be lucky not to get this particular waitress. \n\nHopefully I dont encounter you again.

Unfortunately, I was on tight schedule, but I really wanted my mom to try this place before sending her off at SFO. So we waited and waited, then when we finally got the table, we only had about 40 minutes max or the TSA security people are gonna be real ugly with my mom, and in turn, she will be with me. \n\nSo I quickly notified the waitress that we are in a hurry and we ordered almost immediately as we sat down. And the food came within 10 minutes!! What a savior! We finished the food in 20 minutes or so and immediately got our check, paid, signed, and left. (Actually I don't think I finished my wasabi noodles. But I will never say no to leftovers from this place. It was a good day the next morning because of the leftovers.)\n\nps. the bass is amazing. simply delicious and fresh.and wasabi noodle is, too. I still don't know how they maintain the wasabi taste without getting it all spicy.\n\npps. [TO FELLOW DINERS] I saw a table of 6 who had sat down for 40 minutes and there were no food on the table, just wine, bottles, and glasses. I also literally saw a table of 2 leaving the table with all their belongings for at least 15 minutes and then came back to finish the rest of their courses. I am pretty sure the wait time could've/would've been cut down had they (us, you, me, everyone!) just be a little more considerate and caring. I know you had the reservation and you would like to enjoy the experience and the atmosphere (actually there's no atmosphere, it's so tiny, noisy, and dark inside that there's really nothing romantic about this place other than the substance itself), but to do it at such a busy and popular space, it just seems a bit selfish to me. But that's probably just me. You can carry on doing what you doing and I will definitely book my reservation next time so I can get the tables moving.", "author": "Michael W."}

Finally!\n\nMaybe it's because I had such a great expectation to this place (but with 1900+ reviews with 4.5 stars, how could you not have high expectations?), but at least to me, this place turned out to be a bit of disappointment.\nThe service was okay. Nothing outstanding, but it's not like we were ignored or anything. Although we had a reservation, we still had to wait for about 20 minutes, which was still acceptable.\n\n[ Appetizer ] \n\nScallops: Great. Sauce was amazing and scallops were very well cooked with full of flavors. \nLobster Tempura Salad: Tempura was not at all greasy, so it worked really well with the salad. Again, the dressing was amazing.\n\n[ Entr\u00e9e ]\n\nSeabass: Of course, I had to try their famous seabass. Yes, the fish itself was excellent - no argument about that part. But the ginger soy sauce was way too salty and too strong. From the moment I tasted the sauce, I knew it could ruin the whole dish. The sauce was completely unnecessary. And then, it came with this sad looking noodle, which I couldn't even figure out what it was. It almost tasted like Japanese Yaki Udon, but the texture was way too soft (it did have a nice flavor, though). \n\nAngus Flatiron Steak: The steak was cooked very nicely. It was tender and juicy. But what is wrong with the noodle?? It was again very soft and too spicy. The spiciness was definitely from the chili and not from wasabi.\nI tried the noodle and it was so spicy that I couldn't even have a second bite. And again, where is wasabi??\n\n[ Dessert ]\n\nCr\u00e8me brulee with passion fruit sauce: Nothing outstanding. Very mediocre = disappointing.\n\nThe bill came out about $90 for two, which I think it's relatively affordable. \n\nI just don't really understand why this place gets such great reviews. Did we just order wrong dishes?\nDon't get me wrong, I actually like Asian Fusion Cuisines, but I've been places that can execute the dishes better. \nThe House has such great potential and they do some dishes really well, but I really felt they're just not able to perfect the entire meal. \nIn other words, there was always something wrong in a dish, which is disappointing because they did their appetizers so well.", "author": "Cupie M."}

I decided to chance it and just do a walk in around 7:30pm, and we ended up waiting half an hour or so for a table.  The place was completely packed and the amount of people only grew after we sat down.  It was worth the wait though!  We got the deep fried salmon rolls, the seared sea scallops, the grilled ginger soy sea bass, and the miso black cod.  \n\nThe salmon roll was great, and the hot mustard sauce it came with had quite a kick, so just try a little before you drench the roll with it.  The salmon roll was crispy and cooked on the outside and just barely seared on the inside, making for a delightful combination of flavors.  The seared sea scallops was delicious, as all scallops cooked in butter should be. The black cod was outstanding!  The flesh was soft and buttery, and both savory and sweet.  It was even better than the sea bass in my opinion.  I think it's because they grilled the sea bass, which sort of ruins the texture of the fish.  Sea bass should be steamed rather than grilled to take full advantage of it's naturally soft and buttery texture!  The noodles that came with the sea bass was really good though.  It was flavored with a garlicky soy sauce, and I think I could eat it all day.\n\nAll in all, the food was very good.  It was quite expensive as it came out to a little over $90 for the 2 entrees and  2 appetizers after tax and tip.  However, if you're gonna splurge for dinner, the House is a pretty good choice.  I'm a fan of Asian fusion when it's done well, and I can't wait to go back someday and try some of the other dishes that they offer here.  \n\nP.S. - the restaurant is pretty small and it's crowded in there, so it can get kind of loud.", "author": "Tyler C."}

She's eaten there before and loved it, I wanted to give the place a try.  It's a really small restaurant that probably seats about 35 people.\n\nWe did not make any reservations(as it is best to do so) and the hostess told us that it would be about half an hour wait.  She suggested we take a walk around the neighborhood and asked us to leave our cell phone numbers and would call us when a table is ready.\n\nAfter 45 minutes, no call so we decided to head back to the restaurant, to find that people who arrived after us were already seated.  NOT COOL. we asked about our table and she said we were next, but as soon as a table opens, tell me why...some stupid couple swoops in and sits there. It's not even for them...I guess they hadn't realized that we were first in line. PSHH whatever...we were seated shortly after.\n\nGOOD THING THEIR FOOD MADE UP FOR THE WAIT, OTHERWISE I WOULD GIVE IT A 2 STAR RATING.\n\nWe started with the:\n\nAHI TUNA TAR TAR: we love tuna tar tar so we ordered it.  It came in three layers each held in place with a piece of nori chip. we each grabbed a chip that was filled with the ahi tuna tar tar.  My friend took a bite and she made a face. UH OH....i took a bite...and then I knew what the face was about.  The both of us are not fond of wasabi and there was a hint of wasabi in it. BOO! I tried to make the most out of it, but she couldn't handle it at all.  We were very dissappointed with our first dish and would have enjoyed it A LOT more if there was no taste of wasabi.\n\nSEARED SCALLOPS: it was a special that night.  I love scallops so i had to get it!! this dish did not dissappoint at all. the scallops were cooked to perfection and the sweet mustard-like sauce complimented well with it. YUMMY!!\n\nGRILLED SEABASS: it came with string beans and garlic noodles.  The fish was also grilled to perfection.  I loved the somewhat crispy outside with the buttery soft tender meat in the insides. The meat was really smooth and melted in my mouth.  String beans were nice and crunchy, but the garlic noodles was a bit to salty for my liking.\n\nMISO BLACK COD: it was a special they had just like the scallops.  It came with chinese brocolli and california rolls. I thought the seabass was good, but this was even better.  The meat was softer and juicier and it melted in my mouth even MORE than the seabass. Chinese brocolli was nice and crunchy and went well with the fish and the sauce.  I thought it was weird to have california rolls with it, but it was perfect because the flavors balanced out very well. Overall amazing!!\n\n\nWe had this with a glass of wine each=]\n\nEACH DISH WAS BEAUTIFULLY PRESENTED and i highly recommend giving this place a try, but remember to make reservations!! it's great for couples, friends and small parties!!\n\nSucks that there's only one bathroom stall!!!", "author": "Sarah F."}

This place is all about presentation; everything came out looking quite lovely.  We opted for two small plates and a refreshing lychee iced tea, followed by a shared entree. We started with a lightly battered deep fried salmon roll with the skin on, served with a nice chinese mustard glaze.  Then came ahi tuna poke served on crispy nori chips.  Finally, and this was surely the showcase dish for us, baked black cod drizzled with a delicious ginger soy demi-glaze, and crowned by a warm whole California Roll (real snow crab) sliced on the bias and covered with a dollop of green tobikko.  Now *this* was a nice dish.\n\nThe service was good; they accommodated us even though we were 20 minutes late.

So we came back the next day at opening time and barely got a table (had to be out of there in 1 hour due to reservation).  I ordered the sea bass and I've never had any fish that just melts in your mouth.  Seriously, I think the only way you accomplish this is with a pizza stone at 800+ degrees cooking.  Or a Big Green Egg.  However they did it, I was thoroughly impressed.  2 others at the table had the pork chop (not a fan of sweet & sour anything but the meat was perfectly cooked and not overdone) and the salmon (served on a bed of bok choy).  You could tell that they take extreme care to get the freshest fish (sea bass tasted like they pulled it out of the water that same day as did the salmon) which is 75% of the battle in my book.\n\nWe started with deep-fried soft-shell crab which was good but ultimately, just deep fried.  Sigh - there's only so many ways to make grease taste something not like grease.\n\nWe ended with the creme brulee.  Instead of just the burnt sugar on top, they managed to work in a blueberry/burnt sugar skin which worked well with the delicate creme.  Well done.\n\nMAKE RESERVATIONS.

And by deep fried, I don't mean covered in thick bready batter. this batter was light and still added a great wasabi flavor which also came with a savory dipping sauce and side of spicy salad. \n\nOverall, the place has small spacing, but the food more than makes up for it. Definiately something you would want to check out if you are in the bay area and would like to eat a nice restaurant with 'fancy' food but would still like to keep a somewhat low budget. The uniqueness of the dishes here make it a one of a kind dining experience in sf. A tip I can give you is to make your reservations early and to bring some tissue for your nose if youre planning on ordering the wasabi dishes.", "author": "Amy L."}

I made reservations earlier in the week and the only spot they had available was right at opening. early dinner? i didn't mind.\n\nMy family & I being the hippos we are ordered almost everything on their menu plus the specials. Everything was to die for! There was hardly any conversation at the table as we stuffed our faces other than the occasional \"Mmmmmm\" & \"Oh my God this is good, you want some?\" The pork chop with the pomegranate currant sauce might have been one of the best pieces of meat i have ever put into my mouth (dirty thoughts aside haha). Reminded me of that sweet and savory filipino style bbq pork on a stick but taken to a whole nother level. We also ordered the salmon rolls with the yummy hot mustard sauce, calamari, soft shell crab dish, the garlic ribeye was amazing, a curry seafood special, and a few other dishes if forgot but thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nAfter dinner was over still high off the food binge i discovered the best mango dessert OF MY LIFE. You know the little mango puddings you order at dim sum places with the evaporated milk on top, well they have their own version here & it is soooo good I will never go back to that $1.50 crap. Their MANGO TAPIOCA was slightly firm full of tiny tapicoa balls, jus the right consistency and on the top was a foamy whipped cream that shits on that cheapy evaporated milk stuff on the regular puddings. We ordered the two other desserts they were good but the failed in comparison to my favorite. \n\nThank you House for a wonderful birthday dinner! You bet I will be back even if its jus for my lovely mango tapioca :)", "author": "Maritess N."}

I think I've walked by this place on numerous occasions not really knowing what was going on inside. It's small, and you'd miss it if you didn't know what you were looking at.\n\nI went in confused because I didn't know what the heck I was in for. To my delight, it was good food. Lots of that asian fusion that my friend was talking about. I was here for her birthday with another friend, and it was a nice little intimate place where we could enjoy our food and also hear each other talk at the same time. Everyone around us seemed to be enjoying themselves. It's a nice place, but at the same time it's pretty casual. So don't go in here thinking you have to spruce it up.\n\nBut onto the more important stuff like the food... it was delicious! I loved the sea bass. It came with udon noodles and snow peas and the flavors were excellent. I didn't really like the sauce that came with it (it was a bit too salty and masked the sea bass flavor), but otherwise, I enjoyed it. We ordered mostly off the dinner menu, but we also enjoyed some of the specials of the day like the kobe beef with wasabi noodles. That was damn good. Also, nice presentation of the food all around, especially the ahi tuna tartare. It arrived looking like a spiral. It was cool.\n\nWe also ordered three desserts each, but my favorite was the chocolate cake. My friend said there might have been some alcohol in it, but I think she was lying to me. Or maybe I was just in denial. All I tasted with chocolate and it was delicious. \n\nCan't wait to come back here in the future. There's so much more I want to try! Before arriving here, my friend and I stopped over at The Boardroom and the bartender Martin said it was the \"Best kept secret in North Beach\" and I must agree.", "author": "Caroline L."}

Everything was perfectly cooked, well seasoned with sometimes interesting mix, and definitely well presented (see pics if I manage to figure out how to do that).  \n\nIn terms of notables... well, everything was notable:  pork chop was succulent; sea bass was outstanding; and filet was divine.

I don't remember the last time I did a yelp review, but after eating at this restaurant this past weekend, I haaaaaaad to get on here and talk about how f*#!%n delicious it was.  This restaurant is seriously one of the BEST restaurants I've eaten at.  I'll break it down: (rating 1-5)\n\nAppetizers:\nOysters = I give it a 4  / Served 6 fresh small oysters on a bed of ice with lemon & good sauce. \nDeep Fried Salmon = 5! /  Serves 4 with shredded veggies at the bottom & a good  strong wasabi dip.  \n\nEntrees:\nGrilled Sea Bass with Garlic Noodles = 5! / They serve a good size sea bass with sauce, & garlic ginger soy veggies & garlic noodles.  The sea bass seriously melts in your mouth & has enough flavor where you don't need to add sauce.  The garlic noodles are hella good too, just as good as PPQ; maybe better ;) \nPork Chop = 5! / Whaaaaaat was this really pork? Sure didn't taste like it.  Cuz It was sooooo tender & soooo juicy. The sauce/glaze was too much to handle.  \n\nDessert:\nPineapple Upside Down Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream = 5! / The cake was served on top of a rasberry yogurt sauce.  Me & my bestie kilt it!\n\nService = 5! Our waitress was very informative & attentive & gave good recommendations & wine pairings.  \n\nFYI = This restaurant is tiny so make reservations to save time, BUT since it's located near Broadway, parking is a bitch.

I understand that the place is small but I made a reservation and there were clearly more spacious tables that were empty. \n\nSecond, the service was kind of disorganized. No one told us they were our server and everyone seemed rushed and frazzled. It was a weekday evening, mind you. I wish they made us feel a little more welcome.\n\nAnyway, food.\n\nI really enjoyed the tuna tartare appetizer. Fantastic if you're starving. Presentation is nice as well. Nothing blew me away about the taste - it wasn't particularly unique, but it was delicious nonetheless. Perfect to share among 3-4 people. Would ruin my appetite for the entree if I had it by myself!\n\nI went with the miso black cod (the special that everyone raves about). It was such a large plate of food! The dish comes with 2 large pieces of California roll on top (fresh crab meat and avocado). While a unique and nice addition to the cod, I found these pieces extremely difficult to handle and eat in a decent manner. Moreover, the rolls kept falling into the miso sauce, which would have been alright had the sauce not been extremely salty. I understand that miso is quite salty to begin with, but this sauce was borderline-offensive salty. So I found myself frantically trying to keep my sushi rolls from falling into the sauce and trying to cut them into edible-portions. \n\nThe cod itself is fantastic. As many reviewers have already pointed out, the fish melts in your mouth and is cooked to perfection. Again I found the sauce overbearing and almost unnecessary. The portion is great!\n\nI had a sample of the sea bass with noodles - good but kind of boring.\n\nI really liked the steak with wasabi noodles. I'd definitely get that if I came back. The noodles were pretty special and the steak was delicious. \n\nFor dessert we got the chocolate cake. It was alright. I always have high expectations for chocolate cake and this one was only mediocre. Maybe the coconut creme brulee would have been a better choice!\n\nI think I would have enjoyed my dining experience more had 1. the service was more friendly and interested in us and 2. if we were not shafted to the tiniest table in the whole restaurant because we showed up early and 3. if the miso sauce on my black cod was less salty.\n\nI'd still try The House if you've never been because so many people clearly love it. The prices are not ridiculous and when you finally score a parking spot in North Beach, you'll be in a great mood for a tasty meal.", "author": "Lydia W."}

My dad walks in and before we could even sit down the hostess refused to let my dad use the restroom because they didn't believe he had reservations even though he kept saying that we did and pointing to the four of us as we were waiting inside at the front of the small restaurant. My dad didn't look homeless at all (he wore the same outfit to Michelin starred \"the campton place\" earlier with no issue) so not sure what triggered her reaction. I am not going to say she was racist (my dad is black) but it was shocking. My sister came to my dads defense and asked her to say sorry but she simply called my dad a liar and defended herself. after the hostess acknowledged we were waiting for our table to be set I don't see why she didn't just apologize. what's even worse is who doesn't let someone waiting for a table use the bathroom based on what they look like ? Or even attempts to stop someone from using the bathroom based on how they look? Who would chase someone down to prevent them from using the bathroom?

My BFF and I needed a good meal after a long day of not eating and the 9 hour flight from the east coast and were not disappointed.\n\nThe wait unfortunately dragged onto 9:50 when we finally got sat but not without the door constantly swinging open and hitting various elbows, hearing the loud obnoxious Carrie Bradshaw clone pretend to be intelligent only to engulf the conversations of the diners, and uncomfortable glances from diners in the restaurant already enjoying their meals but feeling the eyes of the owner trying to get them out. \n\nBut but but-the owner did apologize every 10 minutes and promptly seat us when there was a table available. Our server greeted us right away, forgot some of the specials (but we're not going to hold that against her) and placed a lovely salmon tempura appetizer with a wasabi sauce that kicked my butt compliments of the house for the wait. \n\nWe ordered a Ahi appetizer with an arugula salad which was sooooo good and perfectly seasoned with sprinkles of dried seaweed.

The House strikes me as completely overrated; I'd really be comfortable with a 2.5-star rating. I would imagine something in the city with 4+ stars to be quite impressive ... but I didn't see that when I went in.\n\nFood: mediocre\nAmbience: low lighting, cramped quarters, fishy smells\nService: good\n\nWe started with the asparagus. As I had walked in, I had seen a few tables with what looked like long asparagus spears, so I thought it was popular and decided to order it. Little did I know, I was going to end up getting cold asparagus chopped up with peanut dressing and fried carrots. This dish just doesn't make sense. Asparagus is a fresh, summery vegetable and it was paired with a thick spicy peanut sauce; not a good match up. The crisp carrot garnish didn't add anything to the flavor or plate.  My main course was the wasabi noodles with steak, which tons of people have raved about. It wasn't a dish to write home about. It wasn't even a dish I'd revisit. The noodles did taste like wasabi, but not in a fresh and flavorful way. More like someone accidentally dropped wasabi in the wok as they were cooking and decided to go with it. My steak was bland and a bit stringy. the spicy bell peppers on top were the only thing that made it palatable. My date got the sea bass and wasn't impressed at all.\n\nSo ... what do I think of the house? Boring ...", "author": "Akash K."}

At first I thought \"Asian fusion...ehhh\" but with 4.5 stars and 1300 reviews, this place had to be good. Here's what we ordered: \n\nSeared scallop appetizer - tastefully seared just right so the outside while the inside soft and savory.\n\nGrilled ahi tuna with spicy mustard aioli - loved the presentation of this dish when I first saw it. The slightly seared tuna along with the spicy mustard and green sauce was a perfect combo. \n\nGrilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy - !!!! do get this dish if you plan on eating here! This had to be the most amazing sea bass I've ever had. Perfectly seasoned and the sea bass just melted in your mouth. An A+ dish (though the side noodles and veggies weren't especially memorable) \n\nAngus ribeye steak, housemade teriyaki, toasted garlic butter - another excellent dish. Usually I'm too much of a fan of teriyaki sauce, but the chefs here did it right. \n\nChocolate cake - after 4 delicious plates, I could not wait for dessert. The House's Chocolate cake however was quite a disappointment. The cake was overly sweet and rich for my taste. Would not recommend if you do not prefer your desserts too sweet (picky Asian palate concept).\n\nIn conclusion I highly recommend this place to anybody seeking some legit asian fusion while in the city. I would suggest making reservations to avoid the long wait as this restaurant is pretty small. However, we had quite an enjoyable time during our wait as there are many bars and stores open around the North Beach area; we simply relaxed at a snazzy wine bar a couple of blocks down and we received a call when our table was ready. Next time I will for sure try that Miso Cod... 4.5/5 stars (even with the less than memorable dessert).", "author": "Alex G."}

We sat in the front window, which I would suggest is the best place to sit with views out the window down Columbus out of North Beach. \n\nWe had the scallops and flash fried salmon rolls for an appetizer. The scallop was perfectly cooked, and the salmon was great too. I am not a huge raw fish guy at all, but I devoured salmon which was warm and tender in the middle. We also tried their calamari. The sauce on the calamari was the perfect spice for the appetizer, and the rings were cut larger so the bites were more substantial than you'd expect.\n\nMy buddy and I drank Duvel czech beer, which had a wonderfully heavier flavor than expected by color alone. Our lady friends had their Malbec. (NOTE: They only have 1 Malbec there, and you should skip it. Not good at all.)\n\nOur lady friends had their YellowTail, which was out of this world. My buddy had the pulled ribs, which looked great. I had the Pomegranate Porkchop, and if you're going and don't want to be too adventurous, then this is the way to go! Porkchop was perfectly flavored and cooked well. \n\nI get Creme Brulee whenever I can, so I tried this for dessert. It was a coconut creme w/a passion fruit sauce.

The kind of lighting that lends itself to both romantic/seculded and downtown drinks. The hostess was polite but not Mary Poppins and the wait staff was amiable, helpful and attentive. But not in your face, 86 pieces of flare attentive. I hate it when they linger.\n\nThis brings me to the food:\nUN. REAL. We started with a soft-shell crab appetizer that was just perfectly deep fried. Not heavy and a light golden brown that was both succulent and slightly briny. My girlfriend got the mushroom risotto with grilled prawns that was teeming with flavor and I got the niman ranch pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce. HOLY CRAP! This was perhaps the best meal I have ever had the good graces to taste. The pork chop was expertly cooked, bursting with flavor and not the least bit dry. The currant sauce was a devilish pairing and the sweet potato puree that accompanied was a delight!\n\nI will absolutely be going here again. Thus far my favorite meal in the city!!!", "author": "aaron c."}

This is her favorite restaurants in the city and I can truly understand why. Everything was so remarkably good! \n\n[W] The House is a little restaurant in the heart of Chinatown/North Beach area. When you come here, definitely park in the garage on Vallejo and Stockton St. because it's going to be a hassle looking for parking here. This is supposably my sister's favorite restaurant because they have a good variety of food to choose from and it's not too shabby neither. \n\nThis time we had the Deep Fred Salmon Roll with Chinese Hot Mustard http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZoZjbOYR-apY8XvommlNUA?select=v0exOaqzJtTGdOI_9xqxig, Caesar Salad with Crispy Scallops http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZoZjbOYR-apY8XvommlNUA?select=zjn3kSxsz9AXwF2XHUrXJw, the Butterfish and Sesame Soy http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZoZjbOYR-apY8XvommlNUA?select=uCCO9Ua_4mZEj3jNXocSng, Glazed Salmon in a Bonito Sake Broth for the entree http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZoZjbOYR-apY8XvommlNUA?select=W1BX7Hx0L5QQpWmljDttrQ, Raw Oysters on the half shell http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZoZjbOYR-apY8XvommlNUA?select=6z8_-2Pb-qVkrWLm4JiPzw, some chocolate cake with ice cream http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZoZjbOYR-apY8XvommlNUA?select=L95ufgJc8laAUXXspQWSaA, a tapioca dessert http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZoZjbOYR-apY8XvommlNUA?select=DaMY-RPh3YOL0ghgXuLRgQ, and the Passion Fruit Creme Brulee for dessert http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZoZjbOYR-apY8XvommlNUA?select=a_Fd4Os-0p8wKG17LEXeXg. \n \nThe salmon http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZoZjbOYR-apY8XvommlNUA?select=W1BX7Hx0L5QQpWmljDttrQ to me was quite good itself but I think it could taste better with maybe a thick sauce or something. I've tried salmon in many different places and The House cooks it just right and juicy so no complaints for me. \n\n[M] The Caesar salad was really good as well. This dish though was definitely really only god for 1-2 people. We split it between 3 so it wasn't not enough for everyone to be satisfied. \n\n[W] As for the deep fried salmon roll, it's good by itself without that mustard sauce. Maybe it's just me because I don't like mustard and it had a little wasabi taste on it as well. \n\nThe butterfish on the other hand was really good. I think that I should've gotten that rather than the salmon haha. I think I'm going on a little salmon strike for a little while until I can find a place that cooks it really well. \n\nOne more thing to add is to TRY OUT THE OYSTERS!!! They're so good. Probably one of the best places that I've had it. I know all the oysters taste the same BUT The House sauce was what made the difference!\n\n[M] For dessert, I had the Passion Fruit Creme Brulee. The passion fruit was a little on the sour and I don't think i would have minded if they left it out. It was still really good none the less : )\n\nThe House has become my favorite restaurants in San Francisco and I will definitely be back again!", "author": "Mona C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-08-08", "description": "I've been wanting to come year for a couple years after hearing how good the food is ... I wasn't disappointed.  Located in the heart of North Beach is this gem of a restaurant.  It isn't big so making reservations is a good idea.  We went Thursday night at 6 pm and got in without reservations but when we left, there were only two seats available.  Also, you'll be sitting close to your neighbors, which we didn't mind because we met some lovely people and got to ooh-ahh over their food, but if you want a private dining experience, this isn't it.\n\nWe got the tempura fried soft-shell crab ($12.50) for the appetizer with some soy noodles.  What an impressive looking dish when it comes out - it looks like the crab is standing on the back legs.  The crab was delicious, perfectly battered and fried -not over battered and greasy, but light tasting.  I'd give this 4 out of 5 stars because neither of us really cared for the flavor of the noodles.  \n\nFor the entree we got the sea bass and pork chop.  Both around $21/$23.  The sea bass was served with sautted long green beans, thick Asian noodles, and a side of a soy ginger sauce.  The sea bass was perfectly cooked - tender with a nice crust.  The ginger sauce was the perfect optional side.  The green beans and noodles were good but nothing spectacular.  I'd give the fish five stars without question.\n\nThe pork chop was served over mashed potatoes with some asparagus and a pomegranate reduction.  This is one of the best pork chops I've EVER had.  So moist, the pomegranate reduction wasn't too sweet but complemented the pork divinely.  This entire dish gets five stars.\n\nFor dessert we got the apple crumb cake with ice cream (around $8).  Meh.  It gets three stars.  Under seasoned (maybe needs a little cinnamon or nutmeg) and a weird texture - maybe the cornstarch used to thicken the filling. It wasn't bad, it was just average and didn't match our expectations after the first two courses.  \n\nService was good - we didn't feel neglected, they refilled our water, cleared out plates (maybe a little quickly), but it was good.\n\nSo if you have a chance, check out The House.  I know I'll be back.  I'd actually work my schedule around just to go there.  And if you're from out of town, you can easily walk here from Powell shopping area, Chinatown, or even Fisherman's Wharf.

I came here couple years ago, food were great and the severs were nice.\n\nI never want to a restaurant has this kind of \"good\" services in San Francisco. We have made a reservation for party of 8, we were late and we called in and told from  the restaurant they will hold the table for us. We had mention we will be 15-20 mins late. Once we got there they refuse to let us seat down since we already have 6 ppls there and we are late. The lady was like \"u guys were late, and I have another party coming over in 15-20 mins. I can not let u guys seated until everyone is here?!\" We were like REALLY???!! u needed every single one here than we can seated? this is so ridiculous. than why told us will reserve the table and once we got there and refuse to let us seated?? This is not the way how u treat the customers, and the lady give us attitude. Sorry if u don't wanna be a sever please give me some BS attitude like that, otherwise please let me show me some attitude that a sever should have. finally, everyone got there and we can finally seated down at a 6 ppls table, but have to fit in 8 ppls. we ask for the same lady for adding a little small table which right next to us and NO one were sitting there. She refuse to add the table and told us there will be someone seating. really??!!  NO ONE were waiting outside at all. \n\nOK, thanks god our table sever is a boy and he is very nice. HE did show me some attitude that severs SHOULD have.\n\nI will never come back again, ever though how good the food are (reviews).

I left a voicemail as it told me to and that the reservation desk would get back to me... never did.  Tried Sunday... nobody picked up again. T tried today (Tuesday) thinking I'd give it one last shot... and surprisingly someone picked up! Called around 1pm and asked if it were possible for a reservation at 730 for a table of 4... surprisingly they had space. WOOT! So first time here after seeing all the yelp reviews and even my sister told me to try it out. Parking... can be a total nightmare here. Especially since its on a one way street... be ready to circle around a few times especially during busy hours like dinner.\n\nAppetizers, shared the oysters on the half shell. It was decent, the oysters weren't bad, but they weren't amazing either. What did it was the spicy cilantro sauce that it came with, but looking around at the other tables, I may have been happier with another choice. Also shared the classic fried calamari, now that was good. Definitely worth ordering! Finally, my main was the warm wasabi house noodles with the angus flatiron steak... medium rare... droool. It was really good. The sauce was a bit salty, so near the end the noodles that absorbed the sauce made me beg for more water (figuratively speaking). But everything on the plate complimented each other when you ate it in one bite... the noodle, the steak, and the salad on top. The meal was filling and good. I didn't try my friends dishes but one of them ordered off the special and the other two got the kurobuta pork chop and said they enjoyed that as well.\n\nDefinitely worth giving this place a try. It is pretty small in there so I would recommend reservations (if they ever pick up that is). I'll be coming back!", "author": "Johnson S."}

I had the sea bass with them, which was cooked perfectly.  Their mussels in broth appetizer was not revolutionary, but was quite good.  Their pork-based main course with pomegranate sauce was likewise amazing.  The two vegetarian appetizers I tried were well done, although it should be noted there are very limited food options for vegetarians in general.  Food was also plated with some nice touches, if you care about that kind of thing.\n\nNow some negatives:\nThe service was reasonably attentive, but felt rushed and slightly scattered.  For example, we were, we thought, ready to order before she told us there were a bunch of specials.  (Some of this may have been our fault; the fourth person in our party was a no-show).  Prices likewise were not terrible, but felt a bit high, especially on the wine and beer lists, which had markups that were ridiculous even by alcohol list standards.  The place is small (a dozen tables?) and unfortunately, we got stuck with one of the four? in a narrow corridor between the kitchen and bathroom, somehow, which wasn't a very inviting space.\n\nOverall: I'd come back.

The staff seemed to have good timing that goes along with a nice dining experience (bill arriving on time, water refills etc).\n\nOnto the food. I went with the flatiron steak with wasabi noodles. There are a ton of reviews for this place so I'm not going to repeat a lot b/c I'm sure it's been said. But I will say that I have had better steaks before but I'm putting everything in context b/c this isn't a steak house. It was good no doubt but the entire plate as a whole was superb. The noodles are tasty and spicy. The presentation and plating of the dish was exceptional. You just have to try it.\n\nMy g/f went with the sea bass with wasabi noodles. I had a small bite of the fish and it was very good as well. \n\nBefore I forget. We usually don't get dessert but couldn't pass on the truffle cake topped with coffee ice-cream along with small amount of caramel serving as a base for the dish.

My first time at The House was in early 1996. Prior to this evening, my last time was about five or six years ago. The food is still very tasty and well prepared. In fact, not much about the actual restaurant has changed.\n\nFrom a menu perspective, the blue lake green bean tempura is still there. Main dishes are a 50/50 balance between fish and meat/poultry dishes. The grilled chicken breast with curry noodle is no longer on the menu; that was my favorite item.\n\nMy friends and I shared the aforementioned green beans and the asparagus appetizer. I had the flat iron steak with wasabi noodles. We then shared the chocolate cake and the fruit tart special of the day for desert.  Honestly, I didn't taste much wasabi in the noodles, but the soy based sauce really hit the spot and worked well with the meat. It also comes with a topping of kimchee-style Asian slaw.  Both desserts were excellent, but I was already too well lubricated from three glasses of wine to fully enjoy them.\n\nI look forward to eating here again, and I hope it will be sooner rather than later.", "author": "Eating Sleeping T."}

The house killed it by putting actual BBQ sauce over the oysters. I would suggest them put it on the side for taste. But nonetheless they were still good oysters. I had a taste test of all the other plates at the table. Mushroom rice with prawns was so good, wasabi noodles were good, fried salmon roll was good but beware of the chinese mustard sauce.. soo spicy!

The sauce was delicious and a beautiful color and the pork chop was thick and juicy.\n-Fish (forgot what kind, it was also a special that day I think) with garlic noodles and sauteed beans: A fair portion of fish, crunchy beans and thick, chewy, tasty noodles.  \n-Dessert of kabocha pie and chocolate cake: The kabocha cake blew us away.  It was like a pumpkin pie made with kabocha (type of squash).  It wasn't riddled spices, you could taste the natural sweetness of the squash and it was a creamy, smooth texture.

I went here with my sister on a Sunday night and it wasn't hard to make a reservation for 2 at 7:30 just a few hours before.  We ordered the fried salmon rolls for appetizer with spicy mustard which was alright I would say, I had it here before and I think its slightly overrated and will get something else in the future.  For the main entrees, I ordered the black cod which absolutely melts in your mouth, and my sister ordered the Kobe Beef which was delicious as well.  Both were impeccable but definitely not the healthiest if you're concerned with that, both were very fatty meat hence making it delicious.  After the meal although I felt very satisfied by the meal's deliciousness, I also felt kind of nauseous like I ate pure fat--it didn't quite sit the best in my stomach.\n\nI wouldn't recommend the desserts as highly, we got the mango tapioca and the chocolate truffle cake with coconut (the title is something like this), which I thought were both sub-par and couldn't compete to the high-quality of the entrees.  The Mango Tapioca is definitely \"interesting\" I would put it, it is pretty creamy and unique as I have never tasted anything quite like it.  I would say if you're not really into a tangy, sweet, asian (bc of the Tapioca balls), I wouldn't order this.  The chocolate cake was also just OKAY, if I were you I wouldn't get dessert here and just stop somewhere nearby for some Gelato in Little Italy if you really need a sweet fix.  \n\nMy other complaint would probably be the service, it was very difficult to understand the lady who waited on us as her English was definitely not her first language.  When asking her to describe the individual dishes, she had difficulty explaining to us what exactly each dish was, saying stuff like oh this is \"pork\", this is \"steak\" without much elaboration.  She also wasn't the most friendly either.  If the service and venue was better (if the venue was bigger and nicer), the House could get a 5, but its just a bit below that rating in my opinion.", "author": "Heather Y."}

Such a cute little place with very friendly service.  What stood out about the food and service was that even though it was packed and extremely busy, the chef was on with all of his plates - great presentation, food temp, and the quality of the dishes very apparent in the flavors and every dish came out perfect - neither under nor over cooked.  The servers were very good about taking our orders, clearing plates, refilling our drinks and I could tell that they had tried all the dishes here.  Important because of that they were able to make great recommendations (unlike bestbuy employees  =P),   \n\nBetween the 3 of us, we ordered 3 appetizers and 2 entrees.  Perfect amount of food.  We started with raw oysters in the half shell with cilantro dressing - 6 so 2 each, very fresh.  We tried the special for Saturday, the papaya salad.  It was tasty, refreshing and loved the crispy rice on top which gave it a crunchy bite and toasty flavor complimented the salad well.  We had to try the customer sig dish, the deep fried salmon roll with spicy mustard sauce.  The salmon was well packed and the sauce was yummy - somehow this dish reminded me of the appetizers at the CheeseCake Factory - cross between the avocado egg rolls and firecracker salmon rolls.  I know you're thinking - \"HOW COULD YOU?\" dare to compare the two places..\n\nFor entrees, we again went with the special of the night, the BBQ Kobe Beef with Shoestring potatoes.  Kobe beef was cooked medium rare - perfect and the shoestring potatoes were so tasty.  I wish the BBQ sauce came on the side.  Great Kobe beef should not be covered with sauce as it was.  We couldn't stop munching on the shoestring potatoes even when we were stuffed.  2nd entree was the Grilled Sea Bass.  Ohhhh, I can't describe how perfectly cooked the fish was.  I didn't even touch the extra garlic ginger soy dipping sauce.  Perfection on a plate.  Didn't care for the greens but it balanced out the food groups and loved the garlic noodles the sea bass came with.  The chef and owner of the restaurant Larry and his wife have done a great job with this little gem.", "author": "Diana L."}

I made reservations for 2 on a weeknight at 6 but the restaurant still had a few open seats when I arrived (though it definitely filled up with people waiting by the time I left). From the moment our waitress told us the night's specials, I already knew that it would be a great experience.\n\nGreat things!\n- Steamed mussel appetizer: It was my first time having mussels and I am a believer now. The texture was so soft and not at all fishy-smelling. The broth was such a mixture of delicious flavors. I would eat the broth itself!\n- Wasabi noodles with steak: This seems to be a popular dish and rightfully so. Our medium steak was perfectly cooked and the udon was really tasty. This was definitely worth the $18 and then some.\n- Miso glazed cod with crab roll: After reading reviews about the wonderful fish, I knew this was something we had to get. The cod was one of the specials but I'm sure all the other fish dishes are great too. The skin was browned and crispy, but the flesh was flaky and soft and seemed to melt in your mouth like butter. The dish was absolutely gorgeous to look at too.\n- Speed of service: Plates literally come out in a matter of minutes and you can feel how fresh everything tastes.\n- Service: The waitstaff is really attentive, always re-filling drinks and taking dishes away when done.\n\nI really don't have any complaints. I will come back to try everything on the menu! SO GREAT.", "author": "Shira C."}

The waiter was a little slow & forgot to bring us our beverages, but that was no biggie. For the prices I think the waiters should be more \"on it\". But maybe its just because they just opened when we got there. The food here is so good. I'v been here a couple times, but the most recent time I tried one of their specials of the day. It was tempura halibut with caramelized cauliflower with a side of some ginger dipping sauce. I can honestly say that this was downright one of the best seafood dishes I've ever had. I love cauliflower & have never had it made like the way they made it. It had some kind of cream sauce on it as well. I can't even describe how mouthwatering it is. I've been searching pinterest for a similar recipe. Aside from the veggies, I ordered a side of rice to go with the tempura halibut. You can never really go wrong with anything fried, but I was worried bc I was thinking eating fried halibut might ruin the tenderness of the fish. I was wrong because it was seriously so damn good. The ginger dipping sauce with rice just made it that much more good. If you are looking for a good asian fusion meal this is the place to go. The place is fairly small so I can see it getting really packed & uncomfortable. Luckily the last time I went we got there right when it opened. I would definitely come back despite the service.", "author": "Chaena M."}

To describe it imagine eating a salmon flavored M&M, but instead of sweet it was indelibly salty. \n\n2. Unagi Avocado Roll: Again this appetizer is so good!!! With its flaky crust and soft morsels center, the salty fish and soft avocado melts all the way down your throat. Its nothing like your typical Unagi rolls where the rice is slightly heavy and hard. The softness of the fish and rice gives you a light and delicious flavor. \n\n3. Special: Butter fish with blue tail tuna sashimi: OMG this is the best seafood dish I have ever tried. From beginning to end the taste was phenomenal, I let out an OMG after every bite. The butter fish is slow cooked keeping its soft texture, but long enough to provide a perfect crispy taste. The sashimi serves as a perfect complement to the dish providing a perfect contrast between the both styles of serving a delicious fish.

They always have specials, but I haven't been able to stray from my love of the pomegranate pork chop.  Anyone that knows me, knows how much I love pork chops.  The pork chop here is always perfectly cooked.  It is juicy and full of flavour.  It goes perfectly with the pomegranate sauce.  It also comes with mash potato.  My second favourite dish is the sea bass with ginger soy sauce and rice.  The other dishes on the menu is also good, but those 2 are the stand-out entree on the menu.  For dessert, you can't go wrong with the mango pudding.\n\nThey also have a great selection of international beers.\n\nI have never been disappointed by the food or service.", "author": "Phong T."}

Was never impressed.\n\nMy biggest critique here is the flavors really never quite worked for me.  For example, on my second trip here, I had a dish with a distinct sauce using a combination of sesame oil, cream, and I think balsamic vinegar.  The thick taste of cream prevented the strong flavor of sesame oil from leaving my palatte.  Really gross in my humble opinion.  At best, if this combination could work, it's not my job to make it work is it?\n\nPeople all talk about the seabass here.  But really, the sauce has been here for hundreds of years.  It's just the same soy and ginger based sauce Chinese people use for steamed fish.  Why is everyone raving about it?\n\nSeriously, if you want this type of food, please head to LA.  The flavors here are nothing new, and have been among the Americanized Chinese and overseas for years.  Nothing avant garde here - sorry.  3.5 stars at best.", "author": "Mark M."}

We made excellent time from the East Bay and we found a parking space on Columbus, just around the corner.  We walked up Grant and saw 2 more parking spaces.  It was just before11:30 on Monday.  Made me sorry we didn't have more cars or something.  We had reservations for 11:30.  For once Rinky and I were there first.  Usually Marian and Anna are there first, patiently waiting.  I loved standing around outside the restaurant looking at the old time North Beach neighborhood, remembering how I used to hang out there when I was younger.\n\nWe were the first people in the restaurant.  It's small but larger than it looks from the outside.  We were brought lovely little house made pickle pieces, which we quickly demolished.  For $1 we ordered more.  The menu is fairly extensive and there were specials as well.  We ordered the steamed mussels w/ garlic infused shrimp broth and blue lake bean tempura with a pickled ginger soy dipping sauce.  The mussels were a large enough portion for three seafood eaters to share and the tempura was light and perfectly cooked.  The sauce was a tasty accent.  Marian, Anna and I ordered the sea bass, a generous portion accompanied by garlic noodles and what looked to be cut up long beans.  Rinky ordered the grilled Chinese chicken salad with sesame soy vinaigrette.  The bass was tender and moist, the garlic noodles thicker and more subtly flavored than those at Red Crawfish and the beans were al dente and nicely seasoned.  It was an excellent and filling lunch at $20.  Rinky's Chinese chicken salad was artfully arranged and when deconstructed was much larger than it first appeared.  She reported it was very good and took much of it home.  For dessert three of us shared a delicious creme brul\u00e9e w/ a mango pur\u00e9e.  So good!  \n\nAfterward we walked over to Molinari, where Rinky and Marian bought stuff while Anna and I watched, sated, though it didn't stop us from ogling all the wares.  Then we walked over to Victoria Pastries and Rinky, Marian and Anna all bought little somethings.  It was another great outing in stellar company.", "author": "Toni M."}

My gf called me from work to go to lunch and I was looking up places near the financial district but like an idiot I ended up choosing one that was closed.  Fortunately, my gf took it in stride, and we ended up stumbling upon The House after a walking a few blocks down.  What a happy accident, I didn't know it at the time, but I later realized we had stumbled into one of the highest rated restaurants in SF!  \n\nI ordered the Wasabi noodles and it was possibly the best noodle dish I've ever eaten!  I rarely order noodles but these were fantastic, the wasabi was not overpowering which was good because I was at the tail end of my tonsillectomy recovery and was a bit worried.  Great textures in this dish with the crunchy slaw and delicate noodles.  The pork was tender and well seasoned.  The presentation was beautiful and not at all what I expected.  My gf ordered the chicken breast which was also delicious, but not as good as the noodles.   \n\nSo, if your boyfriend or SO happens to make a bonehead mistake, try to be a little forgiving and cut them some slack, because you never know, the experience might turn out to be a little more memorable after all.", "author": "Paul W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-12-30", "description": "I've heard about this place for the longest time, and after seeing various reviews on here, it was time to check it out for myself. My wife made reservations for just the two of us at first, but when we tried to call back and add several more family members, they shot us down. Funny, there were open tables around us when we dined.\n\nFirst off, I had no idea that the restaurant was in front of my nose all these years. When they mean \"tucked in,\" it's no joke. I've probably passed by numerous times. Unfortunately, it also means that particular area is a pain in the butt to find parking. After circling around a million times, and that we were already late for our reservation, it was time to suck it up and pay for parking at one of those private lots. Drat.\n\nUpon arriving, the waitress gave us a very serious look and said since we're late, we'd have to leave in about an hour, since they allocated an hour and half for our reservation. Eh? I thought that was rather weird. So stop wasting our time talking to us, and seat us at our table already!\n\nSince we already checked out the menu online, we wasted no time. After hearing the specials, we went for the grilled calamari salad and the fried salmon roll for starters. For entrees, my wife had the mushroom rice with grilled prawns, while I had the grilled sea bass. Overall, I thought that everything had tremendous balance of flavors, as everything complemented well with each other.\n\nThe grilled calamari within the salad still had that charred flavor that I love. The fried salmon inside the roll was perfectly cooked, very light and crispy on the outside. I had a taste of the mushroom rice, which is essentially risotto, and I thought it was pretty good. The prawns were bursting with flavor, I probably could've just had ohh, about a few dozen of those suckers.\n\nAs for my sea bass, I thought that it was slightly overcooked, but still very good overall. It had tons of grilled flavor and from the garlic ginger soy sauce, and the udon noodles were a nice balance to the crunchy texture of the green beans. I was a bit worried at whether I'd be full after my entree, but no worries here.\n\nFor dessert, we opted for the kobacha squash pie, or just Japanese pumpkin pie. When they brought out the slice, I thought it was rather small, sitting next to a bed of fluffy whipped cream. It was pretty similar to regular pumpkin pie, perhaps with a few chopped pecans or walnuts sprinkled in there. For $7, it's probably not the best value, as they probably just outsourced an entire pie at some bakery for the same amount. \n\nOverall though, I was satisfied with the meal. Not quite sure I would return, as there are just so many other places to try in SF (got a loooong Yelp bookmark list). Price-wise, it's not horrible. As for the service, they seem a bit robotic and completely lacking in soul, but hey they are efficient and quick to top off our water. 4 stars.", "author": "Dru C."}

It was soo good! so delicious!!!  I still crave it.  I mean I literally wanted to just order the noodle itself!  The beef was a little dry and plus my friend asked for a medium and it was more medium rare...\n\nRib Eye - I loved it...i can care less for the potatoes, if I knew I would ask for the noodles instead!  But the meat was cooked at it's perfection, medium rare was what I asked for, medium rare is what I got.  It was soo juicy and full of flavor...it was like a party in my mouth!\n\nSalmon - this is the dish in the broth.  This is probably where the half star played a part, that dish was \"eh\" ..it was alright.  I think the broth was a little too much.\n\nPork chop - now this was the perfection dish... To die for! Moist chop beautiful sauce that complements the meat so well! \n\nOverall this place was delicious and service was great! Loved our waitress Ly she was very helpful \n\nPomegranate. pork chop -...ok hands down, this was the best dish.  The sauce was perfect with the pork chop. The meat itself wasn't dry, and normally I wouldn't order pork because of that, but they did it with such perfection here  that I can turn into a pork lover!!! \n\nWe didn't have any room for dessert, so no comments there.  We had a very  nice server named Ly.  She loved LA food and we were telling her how we loved SF foods.  \n\nIf I lived in SF, I'd probably visit it once a month or every other month...it was a bit pricey, but you are getting what you are paying for!", "author": "Cyn K."}

Went with the boyfriend this morning right when they open. Boyfriend and I have agreed that the dishes we ate today have made it to our favorite dishes list and *possibly* the best dishes we've had so far. \n\nWe ordered: (of course the most raved about dishes)\n- Appetizer (from their specials) scallops and prawn tempura that came garnished with a green salad and some creamy sauce. This was delish! The scallops..oh the scallops, so good. The tempura batter was a nice touch, the prawns and scallops were cooked perfectly and juicy, and the creamy sauce that came with it complimented the flavors so well. The greens went nicely with the seafood, I think it was alfalfa sprouts and something else.\n- Sea Bass with noodles: boyfriend ordered this, he liked it and said the noodles were really good. He practically gave me half of his fish and .. The sea bass was . OMG. so good. so buttery. melts in your mouth, OMG. that is all I can say. \n- Pork Chop with pomegranate sauce: I ordered this, I thought it was really juicy and it was good, but I think that the meat itself needed some more flavor. I found myself trying to drown the pork chop in the sauce it came with. Boyfriend enjoyed this more than I did because he \"likes meat\". I thought it was a very unique dish. We probably should have just traded entrees!\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend the scallop appetizer and the sea bass. The pork chop is unique, but I didn't love it as much as the other 2 dishes. \n\nI really wanted to try the mango tapioca dessert that everyone raves about but unfortunately was too full and going into a food coma. Fortunately, we WILL be coming back for sure and I can't wait to try their other dishes!\n\nThe lunch came out to be around 70 (tips included) for an appetizer and 2 entrees. Quite pricey..but I think it was worth it. I'd definitely recommend this place for special occasions because I sure can't afford going here \"just cause\". \n\n*One thing I noticed was that our waiter talked really fast and had a quiet voice, so it was kind of hard to hear her when she was telling us the specials. I wished she slowed down- it was no biggie, but it was a tad annoying to ask her to repeat herself, and she wasn't too enthused to do so (I notice other people asking her to repeat herself as well, so I don't think it was just us!).

Since I felt a bit vegetable-deficient this week, I ordered us some asparagus, which was quite tasty as well.  My entree was the ahi tuna, which had the right amount of searing on the outside, leaving the raw goodness on the inside.  I loved the flavorful with a little kick but not too spicy wasabe sauce.  My bite of the sea bass was yummmmy also.  And then came the dessert---perfection.  Chocolate cake that was rich in flavor, but surprisingly light, sitting atop some coconut cream, topped with coffee ice cream.  Awesome.\n\nThe service was ridiculously fast.  If they have to scoot away our app plates to make room for the main course, something wasn't timed correctly.  We were wondering if they were trying to boot us out as quickly as possible.  I shouldn't complain about prompt service, but this was a bit weird.  Luckily they didn't bug us to hurry the f up when we were eating dessert, or to pay the bill, etc.  And, we were sitting by the window, which made for some interesting entertainment at times, but left us feeling gawked at during others, so if I have a next time here, I'd prefer to sit a bit further back.

I'll try to break it down for you.\n\nThe first time, I got the sea bass with noodles and green beans. The side dishes were nothing special; it wasn't bad, but nothing memorable. The sea bass on the other hand, was one of the best pieces of fish i have ever had at a restaurant. I eat out a lot, and love seafood. But for some strange reason, this small, somewhat awkward, and not-without-its-flaws restaurant does fish very very well. It was moist, with a textured exterior, and well seasoned. The soy-sauce based dipping sauce should be used in moderation; it can quickly overpower the fish. \n\nThe second time I went, we got the following:\n\nAppetizers: Crispy salmon roll, kobe beef tartare (Special that night) The crispy salmon roll was pretty darn good... with a somewhat rare middle and just cooked through exterior. The hot mustard based dipping sauce compliments it well as long as you do not use too much at once (it has a bite) The kobe beef tartare was ok in my opinion. It would've been better if the (mayo?) based sauce the kobe beef was mixed into kinda overpowered the delicate taste. \n\nEntrees: We got the flank steak on wasabi noodles, Pork Chop w/ pomegranate sauce, sea bass w/ green beans and noodles. \n- Sea bass: See above description.. it was still perfect.\n- Pork Chop: The meat was cooked to medium, thus pretty tender. It was seasoned well on its own. The mash underneath was good enough as a side dish. I actually liked the asparagus spears: cooked enough to be tender, but still with a  bite. The pomegranate sauce actually was too much.. it was good, but the sweetness tires your palate after a while.\n- Flank Steak with Wasabi noodles: The noodles are whatever. It's too heavily sauced, and the wasabi is just perceptible. The flank steak is cooked well however, and pretty well seasoned. Out of the three, this was the weakest.\n\nThis is a must-try, at least once to see for yourself. It gets packed since the place is fairly small although it's deceiving in its size due to couple tables towards the back.

I hate to sound bourgeois and all, but if I go into a restaurant planning to shell out $30 per entr\u00e9e, I would hope for of a more unique dining experience. We sat in these cheap wooden tables and hard chairs that look like it belongs more in a deli. Not too comfortable, and it doesn't do justice to the food's well thought out preparation. Plus, it was dark where we sat. \"The House\" may call it mood lighting, but it felt like lights were turned off due to somebody not paying the electricity bill. Lastly, other than the sea bass, the other beautifully crafted appetizers and entrees tastes weren't all too impressive. We had smelts that that tasted like fish sticks, and the other dishes are forgettable. All this added up to be a boring experience.\n\nOverall, \"The House\" was disappointing. And I expected more. A \"Yelp 4.5 star rating\" more.", "author": "Peter T."}

The place was packed, and those who didn't have reservation, had to line up out the door - joined others in the long line.\n\nThe food is outstanding, very flavorful, very fresh, and the service is good and fast too.\n\nAs soon as we were seated, the waiter greeted us, served us with very tasty, refreshing, a touch spicy of (Asian-kind) cucumber pickles.\n\nA few minutes later, the waiter came back to see if we wanted something to drink.  I ordered Riesling; while hubby who loves Red, wanted suggestion.  She suggested their special Red that infused with Orange.  Hubby afraid that it would get too sweet, but I told him to give it a try.  He glad that he tried it - it was not sweet, more on the drier side, it had nice flavor with a background of orange and spices, pretty smooth too.  My Riesling was really good too, a touch on the drier side, very flavorful, smooth, and fruity.\n\nHubby started with Selected Oysters with Spicy Cilantro Mignonette, and I started with their special: Soft Shelled Crab.  Hubby loved the oysters, he said they were super sweet, fresh, and the spicy cilantro mignonette was excellent.  The plate came with 5 different oysters, and he said he could have 2 or 3 orders more of them - ya, that good!  As for my Soft Shelled Crab, it was super crispy on the outside, super soft and tender inside, and it's not greasy at all.  It came with noodles on the side, that's a touch spicy but super tasty, and cilantro sauce on the side that was excellent too.\n\nFor the main, we shared Warm Wasabi House Noodles with Angus Flatiron Steak.  The noodles was excellent, cooked perfectly with a touch of peanut sauce, a little spicy, a touch of wasabi taste to it and the flatiron steak was cooked perfectly medium rare.  They were marinated nicely, super tender, and melt in your mouth.\n\nFor desserts, we shared Bittersweet Choc Truffle Cake with Coffee ice cream and coconut caramel, and Coconut Creme Brulee with Passion-fruit puree.  Both were EXCELLENT!  Both were very flavorful, and not that sweet.  We hate desserts when the sweetness outweigh the flavors.  The choc truffle cake was very soft and light in texture, intense choc flavor, good balance with home-made coffee ice cream that so tasty, and the coconut caramel was so creamy, tasty, you can tasted and smelled the smokiness.  The brulee had that thin crunchy layer that melt in your mouth, the texture was velvety soft, light, not eggy, and the passion-fruit puree had a touch of sourness, so it was perfect.\n\nIf we didn't have reservations in placed for the rest of our trip, we definitely would go back there every day to try the rest of the items on the menu.

The food simply has to be tried. They get flavors just right, and everything has a unique feel to it, and at the same time it is hard to describe. I normally start out with \"It's Asian-Fusion, but really different from any Asian-Fusion you have tried...\" whenever I try to explain it \n\nMy favorite is definitely the grilled eel over avocado infused rice, the must-have appetizer - 5 stars\n\nThe wasabi steak noodles - 4 starts. Cutting out one star only because once in a while the meat is a bit too stringy and too tough, so it's hit or miss (3 or 5 depending on the source that day)\n\nThe sea bass - 5 stars - great flavor in the noodles and the sauce to balance the white, delicate meat of the fish\n\nI took my Romanian, completely unadventurous in terms of food mother when she came to visit from the motherland and she tried it all out and loved it, so definitely one of the restaurants I would pick to convert a new foodie :)  \n\nOne word of warning: The House is the only place in my 3.5 years in San Francisco where I showed up w/o a rez on a Tuesday and the wait was 1 hour.", "author": "Yvonne P."}

We made a reservation for a 9:00 P.M Monday Dinner. We ordered 8 dishes and ALL of them were absolutely delicious. \n\nAppetizers:\n\n-Fried Calamari (this dish is so tasty and so yummy. I normally don't like calamari but this was ABSOLUTELY delicious. We ordered two of them since they disappeared so fast!)\n-Deep Fried Salmon (this was really delicious and unique)\n-Mussels (REALLY yummy.

I don't like asparagus so I don't know how it tasted. \n-Flat Iron Steak w/ Wasabi Noodles (my dad ordered this and I really liked it. The noodles are tasty and the steak is great).\n-Apple Crumble Pie a la mode- this was a really nice slice of pie. Its really warm and it suits the ice cream really well.\n-Coconut Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e w/ passion fruit (this was absolutely delicious. It tastes so unique and the passionfruit suits the classic creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e so well.

Empty when we arrived but it was pretty early (like 6pm) and by the time we left, it was hoppin'. It's a smaller space with echo-y floors to be advised that if the place is packed, you're going to have to yell to hear your tablemates.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n\nBean Tempura: Very good - Nothing says lovin' like fried vegetables served built-up like a log cabin.\n\nFried Calamari: Standard fair but why not add fried seafood onto fried vegetables if we're going for broke, right?\n\nSea Bass: Good texture, flavor and was well cooked. Loved the Japanese mushroom udon on the side.\n\nRibeye: Lord daz alotta meat. Alot of it fatty but I still had some left over. Cooked perfectly (so many non-steakhouses default to medium well when asked for medium rare). Mashed potatoes were a little whatever.\n\nOne thing I will say is that it seems like all the sauces are really salty. I mean, I love salt but the sauce for the fish, bean tempura and even my teriyaki ribeye dressing seemed over the top when combined altogether.\n\nFor dessert we had the coconut creme brulee with passionfruit puree and the apple crumble a la mode. Oh and a bottle of the bubbly if you can count that as dessert... can't remember the name though - like the more expensive of the 2 champagnes listed (baller, i know).\n\nService was very attentive but I have to say that our waitress was kind of cold. Not that I expect to become besties or anything but this chick was all business. Might be nice for a bit of back and forth before we get down to brass tacks?

The House is one of the places I certainly remember. I have only been to The House twice and both times I always remember their perfectly cooked, flavorful sea bass. It's been awhile since I have been down here. \n\nSince we were up North and it was near Christmas, I decided to make it a point to take hubby here for a nice dinner. I made reservations for 6:00, however, forgetting about the 101 traffic around that time, we were 15 minutes late. Usually, we would go around the city block until we find parking, but since we were already late, we just parked in a private lot paying $11 bucks! \n\nSince we were late, one of the waitress told us we only have one and half an hour to eat which is plenty of time for just for the two of us BUT what was funny is that, when she first told us, in a stern voice, hubby and I thought she meant we had to wait until an hour half later just to eat. I thought we were being punished for being late. Once we understood what she meant, we were seated. \n\nWe were famished by then so we ordered without even relaxing. We ordered the grilled calamari salad (off menu item, special); fried salmon rolls; hubby had the sea bass and I had the mushroom risotto. \n\nDefinitely, two thumbs up for the calamari salad; it was light, the calamari was so tender and the dressing was just on their right. I could have eaten the entire bowl myself. The fried Salmon roll was okay, it just tasted like anything that would be fried with salmon. \n\nI was disappointed when they were not flexible in changing the number in our party. I wanted to have my family there as well, but they couldn't do it. They had plenty of open seating while we were eating to the time we left, I think they could have easily made arrangement.\n\nMy mushroom risotto was cooked perfectly with the earthy taste and flavors of mushrooms. YUM! I am salivating just thinking about it. Once again, the sea bass didn't disappoint, it was just like how I remembered. \n\nI had to have dessert after eating a great meal and decided to order the Kabocha pie; apparently it is a Japanese pumpkin-like pie but instead made with kobocha squash. It was lighter than a pumpkin pie, but still had the flavor and texture. It may be healthier than the American pumpkin pie since I think most of the ingredients is made from soy. It was the BEST squash pie I ever had. Till this day I am craving for more.", "author": "Jeannie C."}

I suggest going for lunch as the food is the same, the portions are the same, but it's at lunch prices with is totally worth it. We had the dumplings and salmon roll to start and the wasabi noodles with salmon and Sea bass for the main. All incredible. The salmon roll comes with a wasabi-soaked dip that had a major kick. If you don't like wasabi I would avoid the sauce, but the roll itself is plenty tasty on its own. The dumplings are great also, but I'll admit they're just dumplings. Id go for something a little more unique to start. The sea bass was cooked perfectly - get the garlic noodles with this as those are also bursting with flavor. I couldn't get enough of the noodles with salmon. Salmon is my favorite fish and I tend to not order it in restaurants as it simply makes me mad when it's not cooked well.

Pork chops are one of those meat that is hard to cook because it can get dry easily.  I ordered the pork chop cooked medium and it was perfect-- not too dry or undercooked.

If I was single, Gordos would be the staple diet whenever I eat out; a  meal at House could get me like at least 15 burritos.  However, if it wasn't for my female sidekick/companion, I would not have ever heard of House.  THE HOUSE IS THE BEST RESTAURANT I'VE EVER EATEN AT.  No joke.  Yesterday was a most glorious night.\n\nI made a reservation for 9 pm.  We came at 8 after the Embarcadero Building Lighting to see if we could get in early but it was so packed.  The House is not big first of all, so it is crammed.  Without even asking if we could be seated early, we went to King of Thai Premium.  I have never seen a King of Thai like this before.  It is swanky to the extreme.  Their menus are the same, but are embossed instead of laminated...crazy.  We had some brewskis to pass the time and watch the regulars flirt with the Thai waitresses.  I am probably going to be like that one day, in say, 30 more years.  Christ.\n\nCame in at 9 and was seated promptly.  Because the House is so small, you are seated very closely to the next table.  Therefore, its kind of hard to have an intimate conversation...a lovemaking melding of the words per se.  You can't ask if this meal with lead to a night of boning due to arched eyebrows and grins.  As appetizers, I ordered the salmon roll.  It was really good.  It is basically salmon in sushi with eggroll paper fried on the outside.  It came with this wasabi sauce which I was not a fan of tho as I do not like wasabi.  It should have come with some soy sauce.\n\nMy girlfriend ordered the famed bass while I ordered the butterfish.  My girlfriend's sea bass was really good; it was very tender and cooked to a flaky perfection.   There was a very light flavor.  However, while it may be the consensus best dish, I thought it paled in comparison to my butterfish.  It was so buttery it was redick.  My only complaint was that it was really small.  I wolfed it down in literally 5 minutes than watched with doe eyed jealousy as my girlfriend savored her cod.  My butterfish, which was the special, came with 4 pieces of tuna sashimi.  Eating that, I now noe the difference between good sashimi and bad sashami.  It literally melted in my mouth.  Goddammit...yearn for it so much.\n\nFor dessert, we had the chocolate truffle cake.  It was very rich and good.  5 stars for the House.  It is the best restaurant I have eaten at to this day.  Another star goes out to our serveur who kept flubbing up on the 7 special entrees/specials.  I kept on making her repeat for kicks and interrupting during it to throw her off.  I only did it in jest...humblest apologies.", "author": "Brian V."}

I guess I was bound to be somewhat disappointed sooner or later.\n\nFirst off, parking in this area completely blows! Add the SantaCon madness and I probably spent a good 30 minutes looking for parking. The closet garages were full and about half a mile away. Ended up finding parking over the Vallejo Rd hill as I got fed up and started to head home.\n\nThe restaurant is tiny. Tables are close so you can definitely hear all the conversations going around.\n\nAs far as the food....\n\n*Cucumbers - First dish comes free as you sit down. Extra costs money. Really? It's just thin slices of marinated cucumbers! My mom makes this at home all the time.\n*Sea Bass - Cooked to perfection. Nice dish but I've had better sea bass. Green beans were tasteful and crunchy. This was definitely the highlight. Garlic noodles were a bit disappointing though. No garlic flavor but it seemed to be drenched in teriyaki sauce?\n*Rib Eye - Average. The teriyaki sauce/marinade just didn't do it for me. The mash with corn and carrots were good. Wouldn't order this again.\n*Ahi Tuna Tartare - Good but not great. Portion size is a bit on the small size. OK to share for 2 people but anymore and you'll have half bites.\n*Baby Octopus Salad w/ Crispy Pork Skin - Yeah, the crispy pork skin sold me. I thought I was going to get real pork skin but it was just pork rinds. Barely any octopus and the \"salad\" itself was very bland.\n*Sauvignon Blanc and some Spanish red wine - Both average. Very small wine by the glass list. Wasn't planning to dine in SF so I didn't bother bringing my own bottle.\n\n$120 total bill and nothing really to brag about. I wouldn't come back by choice.", "author": "Ken N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-10-19", "description": "Came here this past sunday night for me and my boyfriend's 2 month anniversary dinner. He had made reservations for 8:00pm and we got there a little early.  When you first walk in, you notice the place is fairly small. However, the interior is very modern with clean wooden decor giving it a warm, comfortable feeling like you were in \"a house.\" Oddly enough though, there was no hostess stand, so I was a little confused where to check in for our reservation. We stood at the front by the door for maybe 10 minutes or so before somebody came up to us and asked how many people were in our party. We told them we had reservations, and they told us to wait while they checked on our table. After awhile we were finally seated. If you're claustrophobic, I dont recommend this place because the spaces between the tables are very tight. But it didnt bother me, personally. We ordered half a dozen of the fresh oysters for appetizers, and they were pretty good! The sauce they give you with it is slightly sweet, but spicy adding a little zest to the freshness of the oysters. My boyfriend ordered some beer that i have never heard of, which if you notice on the menu, there are alot of beers that they dont sell at regular chain restaurants. I ended up ordering a sparkling wine, i forgot the name of it though, but it was really good. For meals, i ended up getting the Niman ranch pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce and he got the Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy. For the price of the meals, they gave you a generous amount that filled us up no doubt! The presentation of the food was amazing too! Our server was very tentative and cleared our dirty dishes right away and got us a second round of drinks while we looked through the dessert menu. We ended up not getting any dessert but my boyfriend got the almond cookies to go for my parents. (which my mom tried the next day and said they were very good, but very buttery)\n\nOverall, I was very impressed with this restaurant. The whole experience was almost perfect, but minus 1 star for the first impression it gave me when we first walked in. If the servers had some recognition of the people walking in rather have them just standing around in the front for over 10 minutes then this would be a 5 star restaurant.", "author": "Marissa C."}

The food served here is amazingly good, even the boring-but-addicting BLT. I came here with my brother, and we started off with an appetizer that featured fried scallops. Though not a fan of scallops, I have to admit that they were delicious, especially when combined with the mustard sauce drizzled on the plate. For the entr\u00e9e, I ordered a tuna BLT with wasabi mayo, and it went beyond my expectations. The tuna was perfectly cooked so that the outside was crispy but the inside was so soft that it literally melted in my mouth. It came with a small portion of salad that was splashed with the right amount of sour-and-sweet dressing, too.\n\nI also tried my brother's wasabi house noodles with grilled salmon. The boldness of wasabi and the tenderness of the grilled salmon made a perfect combination. No doubt this is the most popular dish at The House. When my brother and I were halfway through our meal, a group of people came in and they all ordered wasabi house noodles. But if the entr\u00e9es came in portions that filled our stomach well, the appetizer came out with only 3 scallops. It was a little short of our expectations--portion-wise--considering it cost around 12 bucks. \n\nDespite the pricey appetizer, I'll definitely come back if I have a chance. Try to visit during lunch to cut your bill down to half. And make sure you call to make a reservation unless you don't mind the wait so that the food tastes ten times better.", "author": "Nguyen D."}

The lunch time dishes are less pricier versus dinner (its says $$$ on yelp but at lunch it would probably be a $$) Lunch is great because its just enough people to have a good time. Plus you don't feel rushed to not dilly dally at your table because someone might be waiting for you to get the hell out of there...\n\nI have been to dinner and it is MUCH more crowded. DEFINITELY suggest making reservations or at least come when its just about opening. When I went for dinner it was when it was opening time so I only had to wait 20-30 minutes. However, my friend who went another time didn't make reservations and he had to wait 2 hours.\n\nAlso the crappy part is this restaurant is at North Beach so it is DEFINITELY going to be hard to find parking. I tend to just muni down town and walk up to NBeach.\n\nThis is also not really good for groups especially during dinner time. It's pretty small.

Honestly, the food, the atmosphere (very small but didn't feel crowded once at your table), the service, the food, the food, the food.  everything we had was awesome.  Appetizers - scallops perfectly cooked and I am a bit of a food snob.  There were three and she offered to make it four (which I thought was really great) but since one of us didn't eat scallops we left it at three).   Crabcake was moist and big enough to share for four people.  My rare seared Ahi had tastes and flavors I will now dream about.  That must be how they get people to come back.  The flavors are ones I have not had in one meal all together.  Fusion at it's best.  Reservations are a must but if you are only two stop by and pray.  Ha!  I absolutely adore North Beach.

Starting with the appetizers -- seared scallops, and hamachi, both of which were covered in a clovery-type green and were really nicely presented.  As entrees, we got the Angus ribeye, which was done perfectly to order, and the grilled sea bass with wasabi noodles, which could not have been too much better.  Dessert was the red velvet cake, which though a bit on the heavy side was just fine.\n\nThe downsides of The House don't really have to do with the food.  For instance, we were told to be there exactly on time or lose our reservation.  It's small, verging on cramped, and the decor is not particularly charming; and because it's small there is a pressure on people to eat and promptly leave.

So make sure you leave early enough to make your reservations or else they will give your table away if you're late. And maybe it's my fault for assuming they will call me (since they did ask for my number) to confirm if I'm still coming, but make sure you call THEM if you're running late. Our party was about 15 minutes late and because we did not call them, they gave away our seats and told us the next table available will be ours. Fine that's acceptable, but what I do not get is that there were two tables open that they could have easily pushed together for our party but they did not. I thought, maybe those two separate tables are reserved. 30 minutes later.. a couple comes in with NO reservations and gets seated immediately in one of the two open tables. I was a little angry but I still thought, okay maybe the OTHER one is reserved so that is why they could not push it together for us. Then another 15 minutes later, a couple with reservations came BUT the waitress who told us to wait had asked them if they wanted to sit here (the open table I've been eyeing the whole time) or another table in the back. So basically... I was late for MY reservations for 15 minutes, but had to wait over 45 minutes for a table when there was tables right in front of me available to put together THE ENTIRE TIME.\n\n*BIG SIGHHHH* Anyways..... on to the food. We ordered:\n\nAHI TUNA APPETIZER - It was decent, but not great.. I would like it a lot better if they were lighter with the wasabi\n\nDEEP FRIED SALMON ROLL - I really enjoyed this appetizer. I loved the crunchy outside with the slightly rare salmon packed inside and the kick from the hot mustard. The cabbage salad that came with it was sweet and refreshing too.\n\nROASTED UNAGI WITH RICE - My favorite of the three. It's a simple appetizer, just a long roasted piece of unagi ontop of avocado and rice but it was soooooo good!! I used to be a big fan of unagi until I ate it so much that I got sick of it, but I think after last night, I am back on the unagi bandwagon!\n\nSTEAK WITH WASABI NOODLES - The steak was really tender and I liked the flavor of the noodles. It was not too heavy with wasabi. The noodles kind of reminds me of those thick Shanghai noodles. A good entree, but nothing spectacular. \n\nGRILLED AHI TUNA - Of all the grilled/seared ahi tuna entrees I have had, this one is by farrrrr my favorite! It was just the perfect combination of flavors and texture. I loved the crispy veggie vermicelli on top of the perfectly grilled and soft tuna on the bed of spinach all ontop of rice with the spicy aioli. If I was to ever come out to deal with parking to eat in North Beach again, it would be for this dish.\n\nBLACK COD WITH SUSHI - The fish is soooo soft and tender and it went well with the sweet sauce. I liked the long sushi they placed ontop of it. It was a simple tasting one like a California Roll but I think it was a good addition to the fish.\n\nSo aside from my little unhappy moment while waiting for our seats, I loved the food here. I would love to come back here again, but maybe only if I'm around the area already or get dropped off because North Beach... you are a nightmare!", "author": "Katherine C."}

A situation that had disaster written ALL OVER it, but I was pleased to proven somewhat narrow minded and very wrong. Because I've eaten here three times now and it's all been really good. \n\nNothing compares with my first lunch experience. If I were writing this review solely off my first review, this place would for sure have 5 stars from me. I had the spicy miso udon with crispy chicken (one of the specials for that day) and I've been dreaming about it ever since. Don't be confused by the Udon on the lunch menu, basically the same with a shoyu broth that does not even come close to comparing with the spicy miso. It was a thick and creamy soup dotted with red-orange drops of chili oil and speckled with sesame seeds and it is one of the best noodles soups I've ever had. However, the noodles were not udon and I know different areas of Japan have specialized versions of udon, but this was no udon I've ever seen before. I would characterize them as the ramen noodles used in the Hakata region, so same ingredients but more resilient and not curly. I will write odes pertaining to this noodle dish, I love soups/broths/stews and this one is high on my list of loves. The chicken was good too, surprisingly came on the side, but that's how it remains so perfectly juicy and crisp. \n\nIt's hard to talk about the dishes I've had seeing as I usually order from the daily specials, it's rare when I eat things off the menu here. I tried my brother's Tuna BLT with wasabi mayo, meh. Boring in comparison with the spicy miso I was eating at the time. We also tried the shrimp and chive dumplings, way too small, but very tasty. And we tried the Caesar salad with crispy scallops which I liked a lot. The scallops couldve been crispier, but they were still nicely crisp, the salad was well-dressed, I would've eaten this as a lunch course for sure. \n\nMAKE RESERVATIONS FOR DINNER!!! \n\n2nd time I came here, my friend and I weren't smart enough to have made reservations and ended up waiting here for well over an hour, and the hostess was non too friendly about the non-reservations peeps. We started with Blue lake bean tempura with pickled ginger soy (not my choice) it was good... I mean it's deep fried green beans, it's hard to go wrong, unless you over batter. We also shared a deep fried soft shell crab that was so beautifully put together I had to take a pic of it. After which my friend made fun of me nonstop for doing. It was a work of art dammit! \n\nWe both had a fish course (boths daily specials), I had a decidedly american styled halibut (cream sauce with mashed potatoes), he had a asian styled skate. His was better than mine, but they were both really good, well cooked, with fantastic accoutrements. \n\n3rd time - made reservations even tho it was lunch on a Tuesday, and thank goodness we did, cause it was packed! I made a mistake of thinking the Udon on the lunch menu was the same udon I had had the first time. It was good, but much lighter than the miso, a simpler but savory shoyu broth, with the perfectly cooked, crispy and juicy chicken. \n\nMy first experience was 5 stars, my next two experiences were both 3 stars, so I guess I can round this off to an overall 3.5 star experience.", "author": "Alison T."}

If I want GOOD Asian food, I could cross the street and go to Chinatown for cheap. It don't matter to me if the place looks a little dingy and there may (or may not) be rats running around in the back kitchen area. (Just kidding. I LOVE Chinatown!)\n\nAnyway, I was not disappointed. =) I ended up with a 9pm reservation for 4 on a Thursday night. We got there at about 850p and were seated in about 15 minutes. A couple came in after us without a reservation and the hostess/waitress told them it was a 1/2 hour wait. So, for sure, get a reservation so you won't have to wait too long.\n\nOur party of four decided to order a few dishes and share so we could all get a good taste of everything. It worked out perfectly. We ordered 2 small plates, the salmon roll (a must!) and the tuna tare tare (the heat from the wasabi sauce hit us up through the nose! But so worth it). And we ordered 3 main dishes. Everything was good and looking over to the other tables, everything LOOKED good! My favorite was the pomogranate pork chop. Perfect amount of sweetness in the sauce. We also ordered the creme brulee and the chocolate torte. The chocolate was my favorite. \n\nAnother plus was that the total with tip came to $35 each! Definitely reasonably priced.\n\nI really wanted to try the scallop dish (not the caesar salad one) that people on yelp were raving about but it wasn't on the menu. =(\n\nService was nothing special. Our waitress was nice but nothing to rave about. It didn't matter though. I left satisfied.", "author": "Lisa G."}

My boyfriend had the grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy (we can see why it is a favorite!). However the green beans were only OK, and the dish could have gone without the chow mien noodles. \n\nI took a risk on the special of the day because it had many elements I liked (Pork Shoulder, foie gras and miso soup) and it was recommended by the waitress.  While the presentation was impressive, there was a lot of fat on the pork and the foie gras was too gelatinous for my taste.  The fatty bits got lost in the miso moat at the bottom of the bowl, and it just felt like a big oily mess.  I was so disappointed and turned off by the fat, that I couldn't even order dessert. \n\nI hope one day to go back and experience The House that everyone raves about.", "author": "Lisa R."}

I spit it out onto my plate, and it was a hard clear shard or something. I showed it to my server, guessing it was glass. She apologized profusely and brought me another entree 20 minutes later, explaining that it was not glass but a piece of plastic from the sushi. Whatever that means. I'm still convinced it was a fucking piece of broken glass that could've fucked up my mouth if I had chewed it any longer.\n\nAnd of course when they brought me my replacement entree, they didn't think to replace my silverware, so I sat there for a while staring at it and trying to flag a server down to get me some utensils.\n\nThe staff won a few points back when they brought me free dessert. Too bad I passed on dessert during the order because I'M ON A FUCKING DIET, but whatever. It's the thought that counts. Though I think that the better thing to do would have been to comp me my dinner.\n\nAt this point, I would've put the restaurant into the 2-3 star bucket because the food was only reasonable - not delicious enough for me to crave it or want to come back, but tasty enough for me to not feel bitter that I didn't just cook for myself at home.\n\nBut then I got home. I started to feel really dizzy and bloated, so I went to lie down. My body started shaking, and I felt chills running up and down my limbs. All of a sudden, an intense pang of nausea struck me, so I ran to the bathroom. Yes, I then projectile vomited for the next hour. \n\nAnd you bitches don't even want to KNOW what other symptoms I endured over the NEXT FOUR DAYS. These are symptoms you'd expect to endure if you lapped a gallon of sewage out of the gutter in a 3rd world country. Every part of my body failed me.

The pricing is kind of out of a college student's range, but this is an exception. \n\nBy the way, my boyfriend and I both really liked the sea bass, and the vegetables that came with it were nice and crisp. \n\nIf you plan on hosting a party here, just heads up- they only take two credit cards per table and the restaurant is relatively small, so plan wayyyy ahead!

The food itself was fantastic but the dining experience wasn't nice completely.\n\nI should've said \"No\" when the hostess offered the seats right by the room divider at the entrance area.  But this place looked very busy and small.  So I really didn't want to ask for more.  Then it became a big mistake and a big mistake made by me.  For the whole hour, when people standing at the entrance area got bored, they were checking on my food, commenting on it, leaning as close as much towards our table and chair, talking over my head, texting with their elbows moving in front of my eyes.  And I had to sit straight, watched my table manner, refrained from talking and finished my food as soon as possible.  If the owners were a little bit more thoughtful, they would've put a bigger room divider or a plant, or a door panel, or just something to keep customers at that table visually (though not physically) further away from the standing crowd.    \n\nHowever, this place seemed to have good reviews on their food.  The sea bass we ordered proved it!  It was the most tasty sea bass dish I've ever had.  Bf's mushroom rice with garlic prawn was delicious too (sort of risotto type).  They've a lot of meat eater favorites and portion was big enough for 2 meals for me.  The inside was simple and nice ,although it's also cramp and noisy.  \n\nIf we go back for its food, we must not sit at that table again and hopefully our experience will improve.", "author": "Ile F."}

We got three things--grilled sea bass, which was served with a side of Asian-style noodles (kind of like Jjajangmyun with a slightly bitter edge) and beans; black miso cod (not too sure if this is exactly what it was called), which was served with bokchoy, two plantain chips, and california roll; tempura soft shell crab.\n\nFirstly, the sea bass...HOLY CRAP. It was perfectly cooked, ridiculously moist and juicy, with each piece coming off tenderly onto my fork. Amazing. The beans were well-cooked and the noodles were good too, but it seemed like a loose interpretation of jjajangmyun to me, so it wasn't as interesting. The sauce it came with was good, but it had a slightly bitter bite to it. The black miso cod was SO FLAVORFUL! Also amazingly well-cooked. They are the gods of fish-cooking, apparently, because they were just on a roll...and speaking of rolls, the california roll! It was okay, kind of dry, but still A-okay. Plantain chips were plain, but I don't like plantains....\n\nSoft shell crab was good, but in my opinion not THAT memorable. Service was good, thankfully.

The mussels were delicious, but could they spare it?(really, there were 8 mussels for $11).  It was served in a very nice broth - but they served no bread.

The scallop was seared to perfection - the middle is still hot and not overcooked at all. Love the greens on top, the peppery green balanced really well with the meaty sweet scallops. And this is really the Only highlight of the meal.  Then time for entr\u00e9e and everything just went downhill...\n\nMain Courses - Warm Wasabi Noodles with Flatiron steak. We had great expectation on this one from all the reviews. However, it was a disappointment.  The noodles were way too oily while the beef is good itself - grilled and seasoned well; but they failed to complement each other.  I was thinking a beef stir fried noodle will taste better than this.\n\nAnother main course we had was also a special of the night - Halibut and mussels cooked in a curry broth/sauce. Again, the halibut was good, but the curry sauce was too bland; and I wish that it can serve with some rice or bread so I can soak up the sauce.\n\nOverall, it is a nice little place, attentive service and generous portion. Maybe I should have tried the sea bass... but you know.... Oh well!", "author": "Prascilla L."}

I called in advance to make the reservation, they required me my credit card number for a party of 6. They also called one day in advance to ask me to confirm the reservation. It was too popular I guess that left us only have choice of 9pm for six ppl. \nNo problem, I confirmed and we showed up around 8:40pm, lots of ppl were still waiting in line so they couldn't get us seated earlier. We waited almost till like 9:30 when we actually sat down. We did complain to them a couple times during this time, almost everyone who came later than us got seated and we were the only group that were still waiting. I mean...I made reservation, gave you my credit card number to hold and even confirmed with you, what's the point for me to make reservation if I still have to wait 30 mins more after the the reserved time? \nBut hey...I guess this store really knows how to do the business. They knew we weren't happy about the wait, so the moment we sat down they gave us a fried calamari for free immediately . This def made us feeling better since we were all so hungry. \nI got the sea bass and it just like what other yelp reviews saying, awesome!! plus the noodle, def want some more! :)) Everything went well I would say, the only reason I gave it 4 stars is...me and my friends all drank water like crazy after we got home.

Located in north beach, you could easily walk past this restaurant had it not been for the crowd of people standing in front of the place. The House is a casual and chic 5-star restaurant. You don't have to whisper and order a $200 bottle of wine, and you don't have 5 billion forks and knives... which are just a couple of things that I love about this place. \n\nWe were seated right away at 8:30ish, but the other couple of times I needed a reservation because we went at prime time (6-8pm). We ordered the salmon roll, the oh-so-famous seabass, and the delicious wasabi noodles with flank steak. Let me tell you something, it was a PARTY IN MY MOUTH with every bite that I took. Man, they don't mess around! The sea bass melted in my mouth and I couldn't get enough of it! The wasabi noodle was a good compliment because it's not so sweet and the texture is completely different. The noodles were cooked to perfection with a wasabi sauce mixed in with some kind of teriyaki sauce giving it an asian fusion taste.

I had high expectations because of the excellent reviews, and came out of the restaurant half happy. While some dishes were good, some were below my expectations. The popular dishes such as the fried salmon roll and sea bass were good. The house noodles were OK -- a little soggy and salty for my taste. We ordered one of the specials of the day, the soft shell crab, was excellent, but the noodles that came with it was wierd. So I think the place has perfected their \"tried and true\" dishes, the newer ones are short of their standard and will need some refinement. If I could I would give the place 3.5 stars, but I am giving 4 because it is hard to find a place that is innovative while price wise making it accessible to many people.

When we got there, the non-reservations wait, according to the hostess, was an hour. We waited two hours (we should have left earlier but kept being told we were at the top of the non-reservations list). The food itself was ok, but I don't think I would wait two hours for food that didn't blow me away. However, maybe if we had gone on a less busy evening or had reservations, my expectations wouldn't have been so high and the food would've tasted better. I had the salmon in a miso soy broth. It tasted pretty good but got cold quickly since we were near the door, which even at 9:45pm still had a steady stream of people coming in and out (and one of our fellow diners kept going out for a smoke and coming back in without closing the door behind him... what a jerk.

We walk up our first of many hills (I don't recall walking down any hills during our trip- strange) and find the tiny House restaurant. Some nice people waiting outside like us for a table. Packed inside because only seats around 30 people. Clean lines, light wood, simple nice space. We head out to happy hour at Grant & Green and return to the House for an incredible meal. Ordered two appz and two entrees and it was a ton of food and everything was SO good. We had sake too, which was amazing. The service was really great and professional, everyone dining in the restaurant seemed to really be enjoying the experience.

It wasn't overly salted and had a nice kick and tang to it. I couldn't help but sip a spoonful of the broth with each mussel morsel. :D\n*American Kobe Skirt Steak with Porcini Mushrooms and Mash Potatoes--MmMmMmm! The steak was cooked perfectly (ordered Medium) and was tender. The porcini mushroom and reduction was a PERFECT compliment to the steak. The steak was pre-cut 'and wasn't drowned in the sauce so you can actually taste the meat. The mash potatoes was still chuncky but was creamy. A total steal at $30!\n*Seabass with garlic ginger soy with noodles: OMG! I'm not a huge fish fan (I like my fish raw), but it was AMAZINGLY GOOD! It's much better than the Misoyaki Butterfish at Roy's. The fish was succulent and grilled perfectly. Luckily, they put the ginger soy in a small bowl as it was a bit salty. Don't douse your fish with the sauce--a little goes a long way. Oh the noodles....it was cooked perfectly--al dente. I love how it had sliver of nori pieces which added a differnetny layer of texture. Aside from the garlic noodles at PPQ, the noodles at The House ROCKED!\n*Chocolate Truffle Cake with Espresso Ice Cream: YUMMY--another winner of the night! The cake litereally tasted like a chocolate truffle. It was decadent, smooth, rich, and not too sweet. The ice cream which was rich and smooth was a perfect compliment b/c it had a very slight bitterness.\n\nAMBIANCE: The House is very simple, super tiny (about 30-35 max capacity), and LOUD! So, as the other reviewers had mentioned, I wouldn't come here with a big group (no more than 4). Also, it's not the best place for a date unless you don't mind shouting from one end of the table to another and getting a lot of \"huhs?\" and \"whats?\". \n\nSERVICE: Was just ok. Our waitress seemed very flustered esp when talking about the specials. Understandable since there were 7 of them; they should have  printed it on paper and provided it along with the menu. My only complaint is I felt like we were being rushed. We weren't even done with out appetizer, and they wanted to pull it away. Nonetheless, our water glass was never empty and the food made up for everything.   \n\nPARKING: We were lucky to get street parking, but it's hard to find. There are nearby garages, but I think they close early. So, I would advise taking a cab or MUNI.\n\nThe House is now my FAVORITE restarant. The food is awesome from start to finish and the prices are very reasonable (1 app, 2 entrees, 1 dessert, and 2 drinks for less than $100). This is a great place to hit up on a Friday/Saturday night before hitting the surrounding clubs/lounges.

With that said, my boyfriend and I wanted to try The House because of the incredible reviews, so rather than order an entree each we opted to share a light lunch of the Tuna BLT with a side salad ...our only mistake, sharing!  After we were done with this incredible sandwich we wanted another one immediately!\n\nThe seared tuna is slice and layered on a bed of bacon, lettuce, and tomato (duh, that would be a BLT) but whats so special is the slight touch of heat from the creamy wasabi mayo...amazing.  The salad was perfect, dressed with a wonderfully light miso vinaigrette.  A faultless light lunch...if a simple sandwich at The House is that good, can't wait to go back and see what else they have to offer!", "author": "Amber G."}

Please yelpers check it out here  http://funfreshfab.blogspot.com/2011/10/taco-tuesdays-house-restaurantsfs-best.html\n\nI can't even believe that after over two years of living in the city, I had never dined in one of San Francisco's yummiest restaurants... The House. Well that was until last Friday, when I sat for two hours in amazement of how delicious the food was. I had always heard amazing reviews about this place from friends and yet for some reason, it was always put on the backburner. BAD decision! I am kicking myself for not trying this place out sooner. Now I know better than to stick to the \"typical\" restaurants and start venturing out to little places such as this that have so much to offer. \n\nSo heres the lowdown on the restaurant: I'ts located in North Beach off of Columbus Avenue and food featured is Asian Fusion. It's a tiny little place so tables are limited and it's always packed. Reservations are a definite must and being on time is of utmost importance! I stress this because my friends and I have a bad habit of always being late to dinner. Usually we are able to weasel are way into letting this slide, but not here! \n\nSo what are the best things to order? Well pretty much everyone that I had talked to prior, had recommended the sea bass. Which I have to agree was one of the most amazing dishes I have ever eaten! I also would recommend the tuna tartare for starters, although I hope you like wasabi because there's A LOT of it! I also could not stop stuffing my face (I know not cute) with the flank steak with wasabi noodles. Nom Nom Nom. I also tried the salad special for the night which was a papaya and steak salad... also excellent as well. Lastly, to finish up a perfect dinner...Warm apple pie with vanilla ice cream. \n\nI was in food heaven and still am after that meal! I highly recommend going if you haven't because you have been missing out! \n\nhttp://funfreshfab.blogspot.com/2011/10/taco-tuesdays-house-restaurantsfs-best.html", "author": "Laura H."}

If you walk-in, the wait can be 20 minutes or more.\n\nThe prices can be steep, about $25 per entr\u00e9e, but the portions are so huge and filling that you'll be feeling sorry you ordered appetizers. Appetizers are OK, but the stars really are the entrees. I was the only one in our party to not get a fish entr\u00e9e, darn you wasabi noodles and flat iron steak, and I was definitely jealous. The House cooks their fish beautifully. Everything is buttery and flavorful.  If you go, order any fish dish and you won't be disappointed.\n\nDessert was OK, but like most places in the city aren't anything exciting. We had the mango tapioca and it was just OK. \n\nService was OK. The hostess/waitress seemed a bit frazzled and wasn't welcoming. The busboy never spoke a word.

Got there 10 minutes early and had to wait outside in the rain for a bit (what else can you do though? The place is TINY!) though you could definitely have a drink next door if you need to. Sat down at our table near the middle which was pretty cramped for the 5 of us but not too bad.. It was to be expected 'cause well... THE PLACE IS TINY!! Probably would be best for smaller parties of 4 or a date for two.\n\nOrdered appetizers:\nWhite shrimp and Chinese chive dumplings - cooked well, not gummy whatsoever but pretty bland and boring.\nDeep-fried oyster w/ baby arugula salad - cooked perfectly, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.\nGrilled calamari in tomato sauce - special of the night. Delicious. Not much else to say haha!\nDeep-fried salmon roll w/ Chinese hot mustard - crunchy and yummy, went well with the hot mustard.\n\n\nOur party had an assortment of drinks as well but I can only review what I had - Black Tea with Lychee! Well for starters I love black tea and I love lychee, so this really couldn't go wrong for me. If you can't handle unsweetened teas however, they provide some natural sugar (yay) and sweet 'n low (eew) packets for you. I usually put one packet of the good stuff in mine. It was refreshing PLUS you got the most awesome tasty ending - a ball of lychee. YUMMM.\n\nFor dinner we had different plates all around that included the sea bass (my plate) and the pork chop with pomegranate sauce which I also got to try.\n\nOk let me stop for a second here and just say that my sea bass was the most delicious, succulent, mouth-watering, juicy, melt-in-my-mouth piece of fish I have EVER tasted!! It was truly amazing. I was pretty much in sea bass heaven. I couldn't even speak much whilst enjoying my sea bass because of the pure bliss. I kept thinking to myself \"what an amazing birthday present\". SERIOUSLY!! The garlic noodles with it, also yuummmyy. My only gripe: the garlic ginger soy wasn't even needed! It was quite strong so only use a small amount if you do, but the fish is wonderful on its own.\nThe pork chop - also amazing! Soo juicy on the inside, nice grill on the outside. The pomegranate sauce with some blueberries thrown in was a great addition and didn't try to mask the beautiful flavor of the meat at all.\n\nAfter all those appetizers, huge dinners, drinks... Yea, we had dessert too. AYE! IT WAS MY FUGGIN BIRTHDAY YO!\nFor dessert we ordered:\nPassion fruit creme brulee - Good, but the passion fruit flavor was STRONG. HELLA STRONG. Wow. But good if you like that sort of thing.\nBlueberry bread pudding w/ vanilla ice cream - Delish! I love bread puddings so this was a great end to the meal. Plus I got a little surprise candle and a happy birthday tune sung to me at the table. Embarrassing? Hell no I love that stuff!\n\nNeedless to say we had an amazing time and everyone enjoyed their meals. The portions were HUGE which is kind of unexpected these days (but in my opinion, who cares hahah) and cooked beautifully as well as presented immaculately.

I never really had anything like the foods here before and it was different from other Asian Fusion restaurants I've had before, but delightfully unique.\n\nWe ordered several dishes and shared it as a party of 5. I have to say the prices are very reasonable, especially for the quality of food.\n\nJasmine tea - We ordered only pot for $6 and they kept on refilling the hot water in it so we had enough for our party throughout our entire meal. Tea was light and fragrant and went well with dinner.\n\nAhi tuna tartare - I had to pass on this one because I'm pregnant, but everyone loved it.\n\nDeep-fried salmon roll - Mmmm, this was a yummy starter and the hot mustard sauce went with it nicely. A bit oily, but crispy and delicious.\n\nMaine crab cake - It was shaped like a pear and it tasted lighter than most crab cakes that I've had but very scrumptious. The crab meat was tender, sweet, and fresh. The filling complimented the crab perfectly and was finished off with a delicious remoulade sauce.\n\nWarm wasabi house noodles with angus flatiron steak - YUM! I loved the noodles, even though it left a strong zing on my tongue (from the wasabi), but it was so good! The flatiron steak was flavored perfectly!\n\nGrilled sea bass - Like all the reviews said, the sea bass is probably the best dish here. It was so tender and fresh and grilled to perfection--melt-in-your-mouth good!\n\nAlaskan halibut in curry (today's special) - Delicious! They do fish really well here. Another tender fish cooked to perfection. I'm not usually a big fan of curry & fish but this dish was surprisingly good.\n\nSeared hamachi & crab roll (today's special) - The crab roll was yummy (but like any other well-made real-crab california roll) and the seared hamachi wasn't bad but nothing too special or memorable. I think it's hard to do cooked hamachi well but I've had better elsewhere.\n\nOverall, the food was great and our dining experience was enjoyable. The flavors were really strong in a lot of the dishes, so every dish kind of hits you with a WHAM, which I'm not that used to for *every* dish at a meal (part of the reason why I knocked off half a star--along with the so-so hamachi), but it's still very delicious.", "author": "H I."}

I've been here too many times to count, enough times to have eaten 3/4 of the menu but apparently not enough times for the wait staff to remember my face. \n\nDining at The House is quite an experience and here are some tips to ensure you walk away satisfied and content: \n\nReservations - Make sure to call for reservations, especially on the weekend. If you have never been here before, be prepared for a small, crowded space where the tables are close in proximity and everyone can hear everything you say. As you can imagine, this place is not an ideal place for a crowd over five.\n\nMenu - Pay close attention to the specials of the day... all seven of them! The menu has not changed significantly over time so listening to the specials are key to understand what is in season and what is fresh. Sometimes I wished they would provide you with a print out of the specials as I often have to strain to hear all the details.  \n\nRecommendations - The lychee ice tea, ginger soy sea bass with noodles and green beans, mussels, pickled cucumbers (free) are staples and favorites of mine. Most often I order one of the specials but my default will always be the sea bass. \n\nOther - Parking is non-existent in this area so I would recommend walking, biking or taking a cab here. If you find yourself having to wait for your meal, take a walk across the street to Cafe Trieste and hang out there.", "author": "Lan H."}

The boyfriend got the pomegranate pork chop and we split the crab cake for an appetizer.  The crab cake (more volcano than cake) was huge, but wasn't as tasty as what I've had in the past.  It did have a little caviar on it, which gave it a great texture and taste.\n\nFor dessert we split three things: the apple pie, the chocolate cake, and the creme brulee.  We all ended up having a different favorite, but mine was for he sure creme brulee- YUM!!\n\nIn closing, make a reservation because it was packed by the time we got there at 7pm on a Saturday.

Before leaving PA, I called to make a reservation to make sure we had a spot for 1PM.  Despite traffic congestion, we made it to this area of North Beach and lucky to find parking so close as well (thanks St. Francis..national shrine just kitty corner from this restaurant!).\n\nWe were greeted with a smile and seated in the L-shaped dining room.  Our table for two was located just in the middle of the dining room.  The restaurant was 1/2 full with a large table full of business folks to one side and a small group of three folks at the table on the other side.\n\nAfter reviewing the menu, our server came back to take our order. She recited today's specials, which all sounded so delectable!  For an appetizer, we opted for the daily special of grilled calamari that was bathed in a roasted tomato sauce and topped with dry Bonita shavings. There was a hint of a BBQ taste to the tomato sauce which was surprising yet all of the flavors married well in this savory dish.\n\nI ordered the Warm wasabi house noodles with grilled salmon.  The noodles were thick and flecked with ruby red dry pepper flakes.  Thin match strip sticks of cucumber lay atop the noodles followed by the grilled salmon.  On top of the salmon was what I would call an \"asian cole slaw.\"  It was very delicious and the spiciness was just right.  \n\nMy son ordered one of the specials of the day which was the rib eye that came with steamed baby bok choy and whipped mashed potatoes that had a flavored oil infusion just beneath it.  He ordered it medium rare and we both found it delicious and full of flavor.\n\nI had the Jasmine pearl for my pot of hot tea.  The fragrance and taste suited my lunch choice very well.  There are many choices for hot tea as well as wine by the bottle and glass.  They also have sodas available.\n\nNeither one of us finished our entire meal (the servings were generous) so we took a to-go box for the left overs.\n\nService was attentive by the waitstaff.  After our appetizers, our small plates and flatware were removed and replaced with new ones.

I had done a ton of research on SF restaurants prior to our trip and I really wanted to get some really good food without spending hundreds of dollars.  The SF dining options are insanely overwhelming but this was a real winner and very reasonably priced!!  We started with the deep fried salmon.  For some reason I think i was expecting more of a sushi type roll but what they brought out were two huge filets of salmon that had been flash fried (i'm guessing.

I've been craving steak for the longest time and told the boyfriend we need to go back to The House and get our fix on. The boyfriend and I both agreed it was time to retry this place and hopefully have better service than the last time we were there.\n\nCalled in a week before Valentine's day and was told they were book sat and sun until 10pm. Wow.. i did not realize how popular this place was going to be. So the boyfriend and i risked it and came in on Sunday around 8pm. To our surprise, the host told us it would be a 45min wait, not bad. We walked around Chinatown to kill time due to it being Chinese new years that weekend so we went exploring. Came back an hr later and still waiting... FINALLY 9:20pm we're seated! If you've been there, you would know that this place is tiny, i mean tiny for it being so busy and crowed. We were seated in a cramped small table literally sitting 5 inches from the next table, but because we knew it was a busy night we were just thankful to be seated. \n\nDue to it being valentines day they had a special menu for the night serving special entrees they do not serve on the regular menu. We were a bit disappointed... until our food came out. For starters we had the miso clams with okra. OMFG it was delicious! It came in a small bowl with about 10-12 clams with a broth to die for. Triangle cut garlic bread was nicely stacked on the clams to be dipped in the broth. We both agreed it was the best dish we had ever had eating out. We were tempt to order seconds! But sadly we didn't because our food came out. I asked the server if they had this on the menu or even sometimes as a special during regular days and she explained it wasn't and it was the chefs special. It's a shame because it would definitely be a hit! So back to the night.. the boyfriend ordered the rib eye steak that comes with asparagus and mash potatoes. He loved it but didn't managed to finish it. I loved his potatoes, very light but also had the flavor of garlic that melted away in your mouth. The portions are decent and pars to the price you pay. I on the other hand ordered the only popular dish they normally serve that night which was the Chilean sea bass with green beans and garlic noodles. I was a bit taken back, i did not remember it being so greasy. As others have mentioned on yelp, the noodles are a bit too much and the green beans were drench with oil. My sea bass was also over cooked and not how i imagined; buttery and melting in my mouth. Maybe it was so busy the one of the cookers had his hand full and left the sea bass cooked in a min to long, but overall i enjoyed the appetizer so much that The House did justice and satisfied me all in all.\n\n Also the staff and our waitress was overly nice and attentive that it made the dinner pleasant. We both felt that the waitress was way better then the other waiter we had the last visit. She made us feel like we weren't just some 20 something year olds on a budget that weren't gonna tip at least 20% like the other older guests. I hate upscale places that treat their guest/customers like that. Treat me like others because really, in the end your earning your tip!

Mind you the door was open and it was cold out, so i was cold my entire meal.\n\ni was excited about our meal here when i saw the plates of food on the neighboring table and was hoping that i would be able to get over the terrible seating arrangement of the place.  But no, I was wrong, sadly.  We ordered the scallops as an appetizer, but they were  boring. Just scallops with some weird creamy sauce that tasted like cheese danish filling. The scallops themselves were good though. Nicely cooked, but wish it had a better sear.  Onto the entrees, we had the American Kobe beef special and the hamachi special.  The American Kobe beef was ordered medium rare, how did it arrive? Over cooked and unevenly cooked. One half was rare and the other half was medium. Why? how do you unevenly cook a piece of meat? This doesn't make any sense to me, especially with all the rave reviews this place has. And the vegetables that came with it? Utterly bland.  Even a little bit of salt would have helped. The hamachi was served with a spicy miso broth, Chinese veggies, and a side of rice. The only good part of this dish was the white rice and spicy miso broth. The fish was terribly over cooked, and the veggies it came with were not fresh. It's hard to believe that the veggies weren't fresh when this place is a couple of blocks away from Chinatown.  There is never anything redeeming about a dish when the main part of it is overcooked. The entire dish is ruined, no matter how tasty it might be. \n\nOverall, this place sucked in my book and I will never come back nor recommend it to anyone.

Service was attentive, yet not overbearing, and everything we ate was interesting and well-balanced.\n\nWe started with the fried salmon role and the ahi tuna tartare.  The salmon role was memorable and creative-like nothing I have seen anywhere else and SO tasty.  \n\nDespite being a dish common at most restaurants, the tuna still tasted new and different. The nori chips served to scoop it with added a new twist to the traditional tartare.  \n\nAt entree time the server (and kitchen!) was nice enough to let me combine 2 of the entrees--a request that would not be welcome in many kitchens.  I had the sea bass served on a bed of the wasabi noodles with the fish's ginger soy sauce on the side.  All of the components of the dish had perfect, bold flavors and the fish was cooked perfectly.  The portion was huge-plenty for leftovers if we were not on vacation.  Husband had the pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce.  It was also huge and delicious.  The sauce was fruity, but not too sweet.  \n\nThe House lived up to the high bar set by other yelp reviews.  It is a restaurant that requires some strategy (reservations and some stalling if you want dinner to last more than 30 minutes-the kitchen is fast!) but if you enter the experience prepared you will have have a fabulous time.  The food and service was superior to that of most of the restaurants we visited on this trip! I only wish it was closer to the east coast so we cold visit more frequently!", "author": "M L."}

The crab cake was really good! Everyone enjoyed the sea bass and the wasabi noodles didn't even take like wasabi to me at all.

Since then, I've been to many Asian-fusion and Asian-inspired restaurants, but always find myself coming back here. I missed the location on 9th, which closed many years ago, but willing to brave hunt for parking in the middle of North Beach to come here. \n\nAfter a day at the Academy of Sciences, my folks wanted to have the kids over for dinner, so the wife and I had an unexpected date night. So here we are. \n\nIt's the weekday night in the middle of the Christmas/New Years Holidays, and this place is packed. And we didn't have any reservations. The hostess/waitstaff person greeted us and asked if we had reservations. We said no and she said the next reservation would be at 9:30, or she can take our name down, and maybe in 20 minutes a seat will open up. Fifteen minutes later, we were seated. We were pretty fortunate because more people without reservations walked in and had to wait. \n\nUsually we order a couple of appetizers, but this time we only shared one (no, we didn't do the cute-Asian-couple-celebrating-their-one-month-dating-anniversary-sharing-the-same-plate-and-feeding-each-other-thing) \n\n-seared scallops with cilantro and citrus sauce, and caviar garnish. This was a special of the day. Three seared scallops, perfectly seared and warm. Topped with watercress. Very good and light start. \n\nFor large plates, one of us usually orders the Chilean Sea Bass, but some of the specials sounded pretty interesting: \n\n-miso glazed black cod with ponzu with Chinese broccoli (gai lan), and a diagonally cut California roll. This was a daily special. The black cod was very light and had an almost fluffy texture to it. Miso glaze matched well with the cod, as well as the ponzu sauce. California roll, instead of being cut into circular pieces, was cut diagonally into 2 pieces. Pretty good, dungeness crab was used. Actually white rice would have been just fine to match the ponzu sauce. \n\n-kurobota pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce, mash potatoes, asparagus. In the web site, Niman Ranch is listed as the pork, but on this menu, kurobota was used instead. Very juicy and moist pork chop, not dry. Sauce was sweet from the pomegranate and current juice and seeds, but enough to complement it, not over power it. So good, I gnawed off the rest of the meat off the bone. \n\nDessert? Gotta have dessert. Wife asked which one was lighter: the mango tapioca, or the passionfruit creme brulee. She got the mango tapioca; I got something on the other side of the spectrum. \n\n-mango tapioca: nice floral pattern made with mango puree. It was very light and refreshing. \n\n-chocolate truffle cake with caramel and coffee ice cream. Very chocolate-ty without being overly sweet. The truffle cake was dense, but a little on the dry side this time. Had this other times, and it was really moist. Otherwise, still pretty happy with the dessert and good way to end the dinner. \n\nThis place still remains one of my favorites. Well prepared and flavorful dishes. \n\nWe'll be back again and again and again.......", "author": "Steve L."}

I had their famous steak which was absolutely divine.  It was flavorful and perfectly cooked.  My friend had the sea bass with noodles & string beans that was just as good, if not better than the steak.  We were feeling rather adventurous that night and ordered the ahi tuna tare tar with nori chips as our appetizer.  To me, I felt like they went heavy handed on the wasabi that night, it was a little too strong for me.  However, the home made chips were tasty.  I greatly appreciate the plating design, and I thought our meal was the complete package.  It looked as good as it tasted.

We tried the special appetizer, a soft shelled crab. It was soggy and not very flavorful. I had the salmon, which was good. \n\nI understand that fusion cuisine is difficult to make well.

When I crave food from the House, I am Homer Simpson daydreaming about donuts and beer. \n\nMy devotion to the House is so intense I admit it's borderline creepy. I am like a religious fanatic trying to spread the good word or something. Anyone who knows me knows that this is my favorite restaurant and if I come across a friend who has never been, I make it my mission to take them there. And everyone eventually drinks the koolaid and converts. But why wouldn't they? What's not to love? It's intensely flavorful yet down-to-earth food at a reasonable price in a charming restaurant in a fun neighborhood. \n\nSo if at some point I introduce the House to a new friend who does not immediately fall in love with their wonderfulness, I am prepared to end that friendship. I know that sounds extreme but hello? have you been to the House? After all, how can I possibly be friends with someone with such poor taste and judgement? Fortunately, I haven't had to put anyone on the chopping block - my conversion rate so far is 100%. \n\nIf I do have a beef with this place, it is TINY and it's that as long as I've been eating there (10 years) and as often as I go (sometimes weekly), you'd think the owner/hostess would at least pretend to recognize me. I guess that's the Asian side of this fusion restaurant. Good thing I don't go there for the warm fuzzies. It's really all about the food anyway.", "author": "mia s."}

It's very helpful that you do that beforehand. \n- The place is small relative to the crowd that tries to get in. With three people it felt small; proceed with caution with large groups (see previous point). \n- Steak here was well done AND the herbs/spices/sauces was a delight. \n- The price is a little steep, but you're getting your money's worth.

Therefore garlic noodles to me = shanghai noodles missing all the meat and veggies. Nothing too impressive.  \n\nAll of my friends love this place and I'd come back if invited, but there's really nothing too special on the menu.  Ahi tartare, calamari, crab cakes are the apps you get at every mid-range Californian restaurant.

However, I have to give it 2 stars due to the poor service I received. I visited this restaurant with 3 people on  08/18/2013 (Sunday night). I called ahead for a reservation and was told the only available one was for 9:30 pm. I specifically asked if it would be OK to arrive that late and was politely reassured that they were used to sit people that late and that the restaurant was very busy until way later than that. We arrived on time at 925pm, waited for our table to be available and felt relieved to see that the restaurant was indeed packed. Unfortunately, my waitress rushed us through the whole dinner even rolling her eyes when asked to clarify the specials of the night. We were brought a warm as tea 70 dollars bottle of wine, and when we asked for a cooler bottle, we were told all bottles were the same, I asked if they had a wine cooler and the waitress asked \"what is a wine cooler?\". Seeing no initiative to fix this issue on her part, we suggested to her to bring a bucket with some ice  which she finally brought to us in an almost reluctant way.  We were determined to have a nice dinner,  ordered 3 starters, and 4 main courses. We were brought the appetizers right away, and (I am not exaggerating) 5 minutes later, we were brought the main courses. The waitress stood there looking at us with our main courses on her hand while other waitress tried to remove the still full of food appetizer plates from the table, I had to tell her to please give us a few more minutes and they turned around without even an apology. We  let them know we had felt rushed but they ignored our comment and just asked us plainly if we wanted dessert. Needless to say we said no and were brought the bill. We left the restaurant and there were still 3 tables with people been served in what I imagine might be the standard of this restaurant service: pleasant, courteous, and professional; since the reviews are mostly positive. Unfortunately, that was not what I experienced despite of the great food that was served to us.", "author": "Linet P."}

Coming to San Fran, I knew we had to eat seafood. My buddy wanted the best of both worlds- seafood and Asian from Chinatown. The House totally fit the bill. After calling to make reservations and being shot down for the evening, we decided to head over early and at worse, eat in nearby Little Italy. We headed over Wednesday night at 6:00. The hostess told us that she could seat us even if we didn't have reservations but that we had exactly one hour to eat. We had no qualms with this and got to business. The wine list was a touch pricey but had some worthwhile wines by glass. We started with scallops in a garlic butter sauce. I've been home for over 48 hours and can still taste them. The scallops were perfectly cooked albeit $14 for 3 medium-sized scallops was a touch stingy.  Between the three of us, we had the seared ahi tuna, the wasabi noodles, and the daily special- a dungeness crab pasta. Every protein was cooked beautifully but the standout was the homemade noodles and the creamy orzo and crab dish. The place was packed but the service was outstanding. Everyone was friendly and despite the manic pace, were happy to chat and make suggestions. Our meal set us back $123 for three glasses of wine, one appetizer, and three main courses.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-02-26", "description": "I can honestly say this is a review that I never wanted to write.  The House has long been one of my favorite restaurants in North Beach.  Being a resident of the predominantly Italian and Chinese neighborhood, an inventive fusion restaurant like The House is a perfect tonic to the more traditional leanings represented by each cuisine in North Beach.\n\n     Two weeks ago my wife and I had a good friend in from New York City.  We were on our way back from a \"Friday Night at the DeYoung\" and at a loss for a place to eat.  Given the time, 8:00pm on a Friday night, The House seemed like a long shot.  My wife was able to call from the cab and lasso a reservation for three.  Hyping our guest on what was sure to be a memorable dining experience filled the rest of our cab ride.  I had no idea how memorable.\n\n     When we arrived we were sat immediately in a corner table and settled in to our dinner.  We began with two appetizers to share, one being a roasted eel that was at once subtle and spicy.  The other was an Ahi tuna dish that was also outstanding.  For our entrees my wife and her friend had the steak with noodles, while I opted for the Monkfish special.  As we began enjoying our main dishes, I saw my friends eyes widen across from me.  She gestured to my wife to slowly look over her right shoulder.  My wife spun around to be greeted by a cockroach the size of quarter making its way up the wall.\n\n     While this was slightly disturbing, and a bit embarrassing given the amount of praise we had exhorted on behalf of the restaurant, we could easily forgive a single, renegade roach, in a building that was upwards of 100 years old.  My wife tactfully caught the roach inside her napkin and placed the wadded up dragnet in a bowl on our table.  What became harder to ignore was the succession of roaches that followed.  Emerging from a crevice where the two walls met behind my wife, two more made their way up the wall followed by another.\n\n     Now I have worked in the restaurant industry for some 15 years and in that time I have encountered many a delicate situation involving bugs.  I knew that causing a scene wouldn't be prudent but clearly our dining experience was over.  I quietly made my way over to the manager, alerting her to the unwanted increase to our reservation.  I explained to her that we wanted the check, to which she asked if we wanted dessert?  I said, \"No just the check.\"  Although she was very apologetic, she seemed reluctant to make any sort of overture regarding reducing our bill.  My friend from New York helped her out by volunteering not to pay for her entree.  This was taken off the bill and we started to gather our belongings to leave.  The other patrons were seemingly none the wiser and we assumed that they would refrain from seating this table after we left.\n\n     What the manager said next was easily the most baffling explanation for our early exit I have ever received in all my years of dining.  She calmly began to explain to me that different people have different \"thresholds\" for this kind of thing.  Somehow this was an example of a lack of fortitude on our part?  I have to admit that this sort of logic infuriated me given the fact that we were paying $25 a plate!!  I was tempted to produce the interned roach from the wadded up napkin on our table, present it to the manager so as to ascertain her \"threshold\".  Perhaps other customers could weigh in and we could get some kind of consensus on the matter.  Maybe there was a Gallop poll we could refer to in an effort to find a national \"threshold\" for roaches with dinner.\n\n     As we left the restaurant dumbfounded, I paused to see if they would reseat our table.  We made our way through the crowded restaurant as another party of three replaced us at the table.  I wondered how they would react to what was sure to be a recurring problem the rest of the night.  I guess The House was banking on this table having a higher \"threshold\".", "author": "Robert C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-05-16", "description": "Restaurants like \"the House\" are giving the high-end 5-star restaurants a run for their money.\n\nThe menu here is inventive, modern, and accessible.  The service is friendly and efficient.  The environment is clean and minimal.  And the clientele is engaged but not out of control.  All of this in North Beach, no less.\n\nClearly, I liked everything about my experience at House, but what was really outstanding was the food.  I am still dreaming of it this morning as I write this review.  The delicate yet bold flavors as well as the presentation made each bite a delight - but again, in a very accessible way.  Every combination worked perfectly, highlighting the best of each ingredient.\n\nWe started with 1/2 dozen oysters which came with a spicy cilantro-laden mignonette.  The mignonette was strong but totally complimented the flavor of the oysters.  Delicious.\n\nFor appetizers, my friend had the Roasted Mushroom Soup and I had the Curried White Shrimp and Mango Salad.  Mmmm!  The soup was velvety and rich, with a hearty flavor and a drizzle of truffle oil - so warming on a chilly night.  My salad was great - shrimp in a creamy curry sauce with mango slices and expertly dressed greens.  I enjoyed every bite.\n\nFor our main courses, my friend had the Sea Bass and I had a special, a Miso-encrusted Cod.  Wow.  Both excellent.  I loved the taste of the Sea Bass - again, perfectly prepared and not overcooked.  Mine was simply awesome - 2 crab rolls draped over the dish like mermaids lounging in the sun, atop a generous portion of butter-soft fish that fell apart to the touch.  Served with broccoli rabe and dressed in a light sauce, this dish was so flavorful and beautiful to look at.\n\nTo accompany our dishes, we had a bottle of Barbera which was very rich and jammy without being heavy.\n\nFor dessert, we split the Mango Tapioca and the Chocolate TART (and by \"tart\" I mean pastry - inside joke - hi, Mark!!!).  Again, both well done and rich without being overwhelming.\n\nWhen you consider all that you are getting, the value of this restaurant is hard to beat.  Entrees land in the high teens, with appetizers and desserts just hovering around the $10 mark.   It's date-worthy and impressive without breaking the bank, special without having to wait for a holiday to visit. \n\nIn describing the type of food to someone else, I hesitate to say fusion, which sounds dated, and the House is anything but dated.  I would say that some dishes have an Asian influence, and the menu is definitely more fish-heavy than meat-heavy, although there is a chicken, pork and beef option on the regular menu.  It is everything that I think of when I think of California-style cuisine - fresh ingredients, bright flavors, with a casually elegant style.  \n\nI will definitely visit the House again, and I feel sure that it will soon take its place among my favorite restaurants in San Francisco.", "author": "Liz S."}

It was unbelievable.  Hands down one of the best meals I have eaten in the city.  If judged exclusively on the quality of the food, The House only rivals Aqua in my experience.  Everything we ordered, without exception, was incredibly good.\n\nWe ordered several specials, and based on our experience, this seemed like a good decision.  For appetizers we had roasted calamari and hamachi sashimi, and for our entrees two of us enjoyed a blackened cod dish topped with a California roll, one of us had the highly acclaimed sea bass, and one of us had a monkfish special in coconut milk.  All of the food tasted extraordinarily fresh, and it was perfectly cooked and beautifully presented.  We enjoyed a reasonably priced bottle of wine, and finished the meal with the bittersweet chocolate cake, which was also very tasty.\n\nThe food was so good at The House that I feel it deserves a five-star rating.  However, some diners may not agree due to the rather casual atmosphere and tight seating.  This is not elegant dining; it's just a casual restaurant with incredible food.  One final note: do not go to The House without a reservation.  We tried to get a table without one on a weeknight, and the wait was nearly an hour, and we called for our reservation at about noon on Saturday, and 9:30 was the only time they could seat us, so plan ahead!\n\nOverall, The House provides a pleasant dining experience and phenomenal food.", "author": "Megan S."}

A little too short, and the middle of the fish is still raw... and a little too long, the texture of the fish gets too flaky and tough. This sea bass was just right.... its smooth texture just melts in your mouth. My goodness... they must have timed their cooking time down to the millisecond! How did they do that?! \n\nThe flat iron steak were just as good.... well seasoned, cooked to a perfect medium rare. Not tough at all. \n\nThe wasabi noodles?

Too bad it was a disaster!\nI'd give the food 4 stars, but the service was what ruined it for me.\n\nFrom the moment we were seated, the waitress was hostile. When she came over to our table, (and we were talking) she turned on her heel after standing there for about 2 seconds.\nThe next time she came back, she did the \"wrap it up\" motion with her hand. WTF???? \nFrom then on, every time she came to the table she was in a huff. Apparently, we were supposed to be giving her our absolute attention at all times.When we weren't she rolled her eyes, sighed, turned on her heel and stalked off.\nWe tried to ignore her rude behavior and enjoy our meal. She wasn't about to let that happen.\nI ordered the black cod, (which I've had several other places. Once at Nobu where the dish was invented, so I know how it should taste.)\nIt was really spicy, and it definitely shouldn't have been. Especially since she never mentioned it was.\nI quickly realized it was the wasabi in the roll on top of the fish. When i called her over, and asked her about it, she insisted there was no wasabi in it. Another person at our table had the same dish, and agreed. Then the waitress got even more pissed. All i did was suggest that she might want to tell people that when she describes the special. (Since it's not on the menu, there's no way to read it.)\nShe went on to take the dish out from under me while i was in mid-bite. Once again...WTF????\nShe continued to make snide,argumentative comments throughout what was left of the meal. \nSeriously, if everyone else hadn't totally agreed, I would have thought I'd lost my mind. I was in shock that any server would behave this way. It was truly unbelievable.\nI called the manager the next day, (which i never do.) She wasn't much better than the server. \nApparently, the server had already called the manager to tell her about our table. Why she chose to tell me this only further illustrates her lack of professionalism. \nI did feel some smugness when the manager informed me the roll did have wasabi in it. Although, that really wasn't  the whole problem. Even if that hadn't happened, I still would have called. The service was that despicable.\nThe manager didn't  apologize, or show any remorse that our dinner was made so unpleasant.\nAnother friend at our table called, and she was told \"We have a lot of neighborhood regulars.\"\nSo, apparently, if you don't live in North Beach, the manager really isn't interested in your business.\n\nNo one at our table will EVER go back here. I have never seen, or personally experienced this behavior and attitude from a restaurant. \nI want to tell as many people as possible about this horrible experience. Maybe then the manager will learn you need the people that don't live in North Beach too.\n\n****I also wanted to add, I've never written a review this long.

The mashed potatoes it came with were just OK though.\n\nThe Seared Ahi was also great- a huge portion of Ahi which was seared just enough to give it a flavorful crust, but still leaving most of the Ahi raw, just how I like it. The PRESENTATION of the dishes at The House is always stunning and dramatic- Thick slices of ruby red ahi towering over the garlicky spinach and rice, all topped with a mound of beautiful purple taro crisps. \n\nThe Pomegranate Kurobata Pork Chop was good, nice and flavorful, but I wasn't wowed by it. (If you want a really great pork chop I'd recommend NOPA, which has a juicy marbled one).\n\nThe AMBIANCE, D\u00c9COR, LOCATION of the House are not as fabulous as the food--It's really tiny and cramped inside, parking in North Beach sucks ass, and there's no valet. The d\u00e9cor is simple and modern, but nothing special. It's nice enough for a casual first date though. \n\nThe SERVICE is good, not over the top fabulous but friendly and accommodating.  I baked a cake for my BFF's bday (Nancy G) and brought it in- the owner said it would be a $3 per person charge for the cake, but in the end she didn't charge us which was nice! They brought the cake out with candles and we had the whole restaurant singing Happy Birthday to my BFF...a perfect ending to an awesome meal.", "author": "amy k."}

I called in the early afternoon and snagged a reservation for 4 at 7.\n\nWe started with the deep-fried salmon roll, which was pretty good. Wasn't the biggest fan of the wasabi sauce though. I had trouble deciding between the grilled ahi tuna and and halibut with coconut curry sauce, but decided to go with the ahi. Presentation was great. Vinagrette on the little salad was sooo goood. My dish came with rice, but I didn't even eat it because I don't really eat rice. They should state on the menu, what exactly comes on the plate. They only list the main item and the sauce. So I had no clue mine would come with rice or the salad. My sister didn't have a clue what would come with her steak, and turns out there was a side of broccolini and mashed potatoes. I would've preferred more veggies than rice. So minus a star for not stating everything that comes on the plate. Everyone seemed to like their dishes, the porkchop with pomegranate sauce, the sea bass (comes with nice green beans and udon noodles), and the ribeye. I just wasn't like OMG when I took my first bite. \n\nLichee black iced tea was pretty good, and bottomless. I liked it better unsweetened. \n\nI probably wouldn't order the tuna again, but would like to try something else. Maybe then they can get bumped up a star.

I really wanted to love The House, I did.\n\nUnfortunately, I feel The House is yet another over-hyped spot.  I liked it, but I didn't love it.  I'm gonna give it a solid 3.  I felt that the food was 'aight, but nothing I'm going to be craving afterward and daydreaming about.\n\nWe had the tuna tar tar, the white shrimp tempura and the scallop special to begin with.  (Yea, we were starving).  I felt the tar tar was overly seasoned with wasabi and/or horseradish, which completely overpowered the delicate flavor of the Ahi tuna.  The white shrimp tempura was great, but they gave us only 2 large shrimp and a shitload of salad heaped on top.  I was expecting the amount  of shrimp to be more like what you would receive with an order of calamari, so I felt the dish was a bit skimp.  But, the flavor was wonderful and it left me desiring more.  Lastly the scallop special.  It was the only appetizer I was'nt disappointed with.  It was great-the scallops were seared perfectly and were quite large.\n\nOn to our main dishes.  I ordered the sea bass with garlic noodles and green beans and my bf ordered the Angus steak dish with wasabi noodles.  My boyfriend really loved his dish, but I was disappointed with mine as well as his.  I felt like both of them were too charbroiled and left that nasty burnt taste in my mouth- both the bass and the steak.  And, I really love garlic noodles and was looking forward to mine but was sadly let down when they were nowhere near as good as Crustacean's.  And, they gave me this sauce to dip my fish and/or beans in- it provided some improvement flavor but without it the dish would have been just plain bad.  The dessert was pretty solid- crumb apple pie a la mode.  But, I felt like it could have had more crumb.\n\nI will say this- our server and the other employees were very courteous and friendly, which added to the experience.  I felt like our server was reading my mind and preemptively providing answers to questions I hadn't even asked yet.  That was nice.\n\nMaybe I'll give it another try in the future, but I'm not dying to go back.

My boyfriend took me here for my birthday last night, which was a nice change from all the down-home Italian places we've been going lately. The BF actually had to put on his \"nice\" shirt for dinner. And by \"nice\" shirt I mean a long-sleeved thermal shirt that looks like you should wear it under your ski clothes. So hot! He almost cried a bit when I asked him with a raised eyebrow if that was what he was going to wear to dinner. \n\nAnyway, we walked to The House and were seated at a spacious four person table, which I'm very fond of because you actually have room to spread out and put your shit all over the extra chairs. Big tables allow me to be the slob I am at home, but in public! \n\nThe space is small, unpretentious and simple. The walls and floors are earth-toned, accented with these really odd small paintings featuring beast-type animals doing something that resembles a sex scene from hell. The menu is also very simple looking. It's a one-page laminated menu with food on the front and wine by the glass on the back. Right off, we decided to order a bunch of starters to share instead of doing main courses. \n\nThe tuna tartar was succulent, light and refreshing, with a hint of citrus. It was sort of difficult to eat, but delighted my palate non-the-less. Next was the curried white shrimp and mango salad, which might have been the winner of the night. I still can't decide because each and every dish made me make inappropriate sex noises. But the shrimp was the best I've ever had. It was perfectly grilled and was so hearty that it somewhat resembled meat. \n\nThe next three courses were a lobster salad and classic fried calamari and for dessert, a mango tapioca. I'm going to spare you the details because I'll basically be saying the same thing over and over, and boring my fellow Yelpers is a sin I'd like to steer clear from. The dessert was my least favorite part of the meal. It was cold, sweet and tasty, but paled in comparison to the other plates. The presentation is breathtaking. I felt a bit like a schmuck digging into the food, disturbing the beautiful art the chef had just created, but my oh my, it was well worth it once I popped one of their juicy morsels into my mouth. \n\nThe House is definitely a must try! The main courses looked gorgeous too and I might be inclined to try one the next time I visit. The one downfall of the whole evening were our dining partners. The people next to us were having the world's most boring conversation at unexpectedly high decibels. Talking excitedly about the wonderful world of emailing, and a whole bunch of other topics I tried to block out. But even our dull-ass neighbors couldn't put too much of a dent into our perfect meal.", "author": "Sammy S."}

We didn't have to debate for long but the daily specials threw us a curve ball.  We didn't change our mind on the appetizer - got one of their special instead of the fried salmon roll although we both wished we ordered that too.\n\nWhat we had:\nbig eye tuna sashimi served with finely chopped red onion, capers, few sliver of chili pepper w/ 2 pieces of seaweed, a dallop of wasabi tobiko.  5 generous slices of sashimi was served over paper thin sliced of cucumber.  the tuna was so good, it melts in the mouth.\n\navocado unagi sandwich w/ a side of mixed green salad - this was so delicious.  the bread was buttered and grilled with a nice crunch and the center was piled with large pieces of unagi and avocado with lettuce and tomato.  each biteful was sinfully good.  the mixed green was tossed in a light miso flavored dressing, very refreshing.\n\nhomemade wasabi noodle w/ grilled salmon - the salmon was grilled to perfection with the center still pink, every bite was pure heaven.  the noodle was a bit choppy and i didn't taste any wasabi flavor.  it was also a bit on the oily side but it was flavorful.\n\nfor dessert, we had one of the specials - cheesecake w/ mixed berries and cream.  The cheesecake was ok, a bit too dense but I loved the berries - strawberry, blackberry, blueberry - all were so sweet.\n\nBill came to just over $40, a great deal.

I love venturing away from chain restaurants so I was pretty excited about trying this place.  The wait was a little long even though we had a reservation, but it was bearable.  We were promptly seated at the table right next to the door, which I was pretty bummed about because of the super tight squeeze against the divider and constant breeze from the doorway.  Next time I think I'll request a table closer to the back.\n\nThe food:  We ordered the scallops with microgreens. Okay, if I could rate this I would give it a 10.  The scallops were cooked perfectly and the sauces and microgreens were in perfect pairings.  I ordered the special, which was the kobe beef with cauliflower and mashed potatoes.  Again the sauces were the perfect compliments to the meat.  My only complaint was the food wasn't piping hot when it arrived :/ The sauce was actually hotter than the meat.  For me though, the flavors could not get any better.  For dessert, we had the coconut creme brulee which I wasn't sure I would be fond of because of my so so feeling about coconut, but this was absolutely delicious.  Just enough sweetness and enough tart to cut the sweetness, yum!\n\nThe service: Our servers were pretty good about refilling our water and keeping us updated on our orders.  Our food was prompt which is amazing considering how busy this place is!\n\nOverall, I think the sauces at this restaurant make the meals, meaning I couldn't imagine anything I had without it, nor would I want to have it without.  This is a place that leaves you feeling kinda cramped eager to stretch , but kinda forget about it when your food arrives.

Actually, not too legendary as I had only heard about it once from a friend at the gym. A friend we were with had been here many times, so we appointed her as our menu advisor. Black cod and sea bass highly recommended.\n\nOverall, everything was delicious and tasty, but not orgasmically must-return-the-next-evening good.\n\nSix of us shared the following: 2x miso black cod, 2x grilled sea bass, prawns w/ risotto, and wasabi noodles w/ steak.\n\nMiso black cod - Solid, but not as good flavorful as Nobu. Still my favorite of the evening though. It was one of the specials and I would order it if they had it again. A fairly generous portion served with California roll (weird) and some veggies.\n\nGrilled sea bass - I'm such a sucker for sea bass, so of course I loved this. I also love green beans. A good fall back if they don't have black cod. Served with noodles that looked just like the wasabi noodles, but without the wasabi. lol!\n\nPrawns w/ risotto - The prawns were huge, cooked to perfection, and had great seasoning. Risotto was just ok, seems like something I might be able to whip up at home from an online recipe.\n\nWasabi noodles w/ steak - Not bad, but pretty basic imo. Stir fried noodles with a kick of wasabi, topped with some sliced steak.\n\nSoft-shell crab tempura - Good appetizer, although I forgot to try the dipping sauce. A bit hard to share. :P\n\nI was curious about the pork w/ pomegranate sauce as I love this combination, but a friend said it was kinda dry the last time she ordered it.\n\nThe restaurant is really small, and fortunately we had a reservation. As mentioned in many of the other reviews, the tables *are* very close together, so perhaps not the most private atmosphere.\n\nService was good and prompt. Parking is ridiculous in this area, so come early and be prepared to walk a bit.\n\nIt was decent value, but I'm not sure I'd come back without the black cod.

Since lunch is definitely a better deal, especially for one of their signature dishes - the sea bass with house noodles and green beans at $20, we stopped in on Saturday afternoon.  The four of us were pretty excited to return after a year-long absence, and M.  already knew she would be ordering the sea bass the night before, which certainly didn't fail to impress yet again.  \n\nI ordered the skate special with a mushroom sauce on top of a layer of Chinese broccoli and mashed potatoes, which at $20 was a great price for such a wonderfully executed dish, I couldn't have been happier with my order.  Unfortunately, I was so excited to try the skate that when my dish came out, I delved right in and forgot that we were taking pictures! Again.  There are just so many different things to try out here, but one thing is for certain, The House does a fantastic job with seafood.  I still dream about their seared yellow tail with crab sushi, which unfortunately is only offered on their dinner menu.  I had a sample of the curry noodles and it was tasty, but I'm glad J. and I didn't order another noodle dish for us to share since my fat-ass was so craving their noodles.  \n\nThe entree portion here is very filling with your side of protein, starch, and veggies, but along with our appetizers of Calamari and Salmon Rolls, and our dessert orders of coconut-passion fruit cr\u00e8me brulee and Japanese pumpkin pecan pie - I was pretty much done for the rest of the day.

We both wanted the seabass, but we usually order two different plates, just in case one wasn't good, then the other should be good. Then we split half of our plate and give it to the other. I was totally hungry. When it came, the food looked great. \"A\" for presentation. The seabass was great and the steak my bf had was great.

In fact - SO amazing that mid-meal, I demanded a plate switch to finish off the pork shoulder.  Thankfully, he liked the seabass too, so in all of my feigned generosity, I offered: \"Here, you can finish my seabass....\" which worked amazingly well.  (OK, that, and the fact that he'd go to all lengths to keep me happy... even give up the delish pork body part!!!)\n\nAll of it - great.\nAppetizers were delicious.  We had at least 3 or 4 appetizers, and all of it was just perfect.  (This was a few weeks ago.  With time, goes memory... but they WERE all amazing!!) Entrees were as tasty as anyone can ever expect.\n\nAnd add to that the price which was reasonable all around - - The House brings the house down, so to speak.\n\nService was pretty good - - and ambience is rather nice and cozy, small but they don't seat you like sardines either, so that is good.  A good variety of alcohol was available from wines to Chimay beer.\n\nWe were in a mad rush that evening - and our party of 8 were seated quickly, and served quickly too.

It was my first meal (a lunch) when I arrived in SF almost 11 years ago and I still eat there.\n\nI've been enjoying the pork chop for over 10 years and it is still awesome...the lobster salad special is ridiculously good and I order it whenever it's available. Other faves are salmon rolls, the crab cake (whenever it's a special), and blue lake bean tempura. I had a steak special there one evening and it was the only restaurant dish I have ever had a dream about. \n\nI bring every out of town guest to House and it appeals to everyone and no one is ever disappointed (if they were they were lying!). What really puts House's food above the rest is that it's incredibly versatile without losing focus. Vegetarians have plenty of choices, as do the lactose intolerant or those who don't eat a lot of dairy or red meat, or those who need gluten free food -- everything is exploding with flavor, texture and contrast. \n\nAbout 5 years ago or so, I asked if Larry would ever consider releasing a cookbook and the answer was a definitive 'no.' \n\nBummer.

Using the phrase in all sincerity - TO DIE FOR!  THe most delicious bites I have had on my tongue in months - could not have been better.  Delicious.\n\nAnd, we also had the salad with crispy scallops (yes, we enjoy scallops).  Good - nothing special.\n\nFor a main course, my wife had a special rock cod with a crab/avacado roll over the top.  Deliciously prepared and beautifully presented.  She actually commented on how well it was presented - not normal so you know it was good.\n\nI had the special filet.  It tasted really good, but my first few bites had both solid fat and gristle in them - not the best prepped filet I have ever had.   When I got past these, it was pretty good.  The potatoes were OK.\n\nThen we had desert, my wife chose the apple crisp ala mode.  I had a Cherry/Nectarine Pie.  I didn't try hers, but she looked satisfied.  Mine was incredible.  I love Cherry pie and this was a very special cherry pie.\n\nHighly recommended, bring a megaphone or walkie talkies.", "author": "Jonathan D."}

It gets pretty crowded so I would suggest making a reservation. There were some people that were walk-ins and I overheard the wait time being around an hour. \n\nThe service varies on who you get. The guy who set up our table didn't even acknowledge us. He just put down the menus and walked away. The guy who took our order was more attentive. \n\nAs for the food, we ordered 2 appetizers: deep fried chicken liver with greens and mussels. I loved both but I was a little disappointed in the mussels, only because a lot of the mussels meat were out of the shell so it seemed like we were given a plate of empty shells. For our entrees, we ordered: the wasabi noodles with steak and kurobuta pork. The noodles were fantastic, clearly the star of the dish with the steak being just a topping. I loved the pork as well.. very tender and the pomegranate glaze went really well! Even though we were pretty much stuffed, we decided to get dessert. I mean, come on, how can I say no to creme brulee? We also ordered the persimmon bread pudding special that night, which was awesome!

I've been here twice (so far) and I totally fell in LOVE with The House ever since the first time...\nSo far, I tasted: \n-Calamari as an appetizer (5/5) Not that hard to mess up.. I don't think.. \n-Angus ribeye steak (4.5/5) It has their housemade teriyaki with toasted garlic butter.  I love the taste of the seasoning; however, BOTH times, there are too much fat on it, which is pratically 1/3 of the whole steak.\n-Grilled ahi tuna (rare) with spicy mustard aioli (5/5) The ahi tuna was so fresh, it melted and dissolved in your mouth.... Not to mention the sauce was delicious too!\n- Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy (5/5) The sea bass was sooooo soft and yummy... \nIt is a little pricy  for what it is but it's def. worth of every penny and your taste bud will appreciate it too.  I always recommend ALL my friends and family to go here when they are in SF. This is a MUST place to dine- in .

I wouldn't say spectacular but I did appreciate them coming back after each meal to replace our utensils. \n2) Atmosphere is very cozy and nice.\n3) Dishes - I ordered the fish special yellow tail which was surprisingly delicious. Every bite was very tasteful. Although the California roll on top wasn't too great. It was just there really for presentation. I would definitely recommend this dish. My friends ordered beef noodles which was alright - noodles was great but steak was a little too chewy. \nDessert - definitely recommend Mango Tapioca which was very smooth and tasty. \n\nCONS\n1) It looks like shit from the outside. My friends thought I was crazy to make reservation for this place. But please don't judge a book by it's cover. It's pretty decent from the inside. \n2) They sat us down right away since we made reservations (highly recommend). However the place was so crowded that your elbows will touch your neighbors. A little too small for a big person. \n3) Price is expensive.  3 entres and a dessert for ~$110 with tip. Maybe it's worth it. \n4) It took awhile for us to get our check. I've seen only 3 servers. We really had to wave our hands to catch their attention. Took about 20 minutes for our check. \n5) The one restroom was in a really crowded area in the back next to the kitchen which was a bothersome if u stand and wait there because the servers will keep coming back and forth and ask u to move because you're standing next to their stack of unwashed dishes. \n\nOverall, I do recommend this place because of the tasty food.

We had a caprese salad and soft shell crab for appetizers; the former was an interesting take, with peaches and chewy cheese, while the latter was well-crisped, but a bit overwrought in its presentation (breadsticks coming out of the crab's appendages kind of wigged me out, TBH). For the entree, I had the grilled ahi and the Boy had the domestic kobe beef steak; mine entree was fine (I'm glad to say the ahi was sliced well and cooked rare) while his entree was fantastic. Fantastic. I wanted to eat his steak again and again (that's what she said?). But, seriously, I didn't even realize that we had domestic kobe cows here, but whatever we're doing, I recommend we keep on doing. The steak was 1/2 the cost of an imported kobe beef steak and it was equally tasty. \n\nDessert was also memorable -- coconut creme brulee with a tart, bright passionfruit puree --- and I'm looking back to coming back. \n\nThe only downside was that the wine list was a bit uninspired, with few reds and mostly sparkling and sweet whites, which I guess complement asian fusion?\n\nAnyway, TL;DR -- good food for medium-high prices. I recommend giving it a try and bringing some friends, as the dishes are big enough to share and you'll get more variety that way.", "author": "Annie M."}

The noodles (which i believe are handmade) are thick, perfectly chewy with just the right amount of give, hearty and the perfect blank palette for their sauces including wasabi (their signature wasabi house noodles don't actually taste much like wasabi but is a pleasantly spicy, well seasoned dish) and curry (I liked this version better).\n\nHowever. What you MUST try here are their mussels, which are SWIMMING in a lovely Asian-flavored butter broth. It's basically a bowl of soup made with butter and some other seasonings that make it finger licking good, topped with a dollop of masago caviar.

Why? Because Im Asian and it happened to be CNY?

Trust me, get the pork chops.\n\nThe food here is so indescribably good, you just have to try it.  Our meal ended on another perfect note with the warm blueberry bread pudding that we got.

Decor is clean, but somewhat dark and muted.  \"Should we eat here?\", we asked ourselves, \"maybe not...\"  but  WAIT!!\n\nLook at the people's faces!  They were glowing with satisfaction!  Everyone was wearing a smile and enjoying their dishes...//...And off to a table we went...\n\nThe tables are small, and so is the menu, but for a restaurant of its size, its certainly not bad.  Service was pleasant, but curt.  Nothing special by any means, but nothing bad.  The highlight was the food itself.  \n\nSome of the standout dishes were:  \n\n*Broiled Unagi with avocado sushi rice.  This was just great; not for the \"wow\" factor, but just because it was plain good.  The eel was smokey and charred and went perfectly with the sushi rice and avocado.  The flurry of bonito shavings was a nice touch.  It was quite comforting, especially in this December weather.\n\n*Seared Scallops with lemon-ponzu and micro-greens.  Another great dish- the scallops were nicely caramelized and perfectly rare on the inside.  The lemon sauce (not a ponzu...no soy to be found) was nice, and the micro-greens had some sort of orange dressing.  \n\n*Pan-seared duck breast with blackberry sauce and mashed potatoes.  Amazing!!  The duck was nice and juicy, pefectly medium-rare, and was paired with an awsome blackberry reduction.  It wasn't too sweet or too fruity like some duck sauces.  A few warmed berries finished the dish.  A simple, but well-prepared dish.  \n\nWe also had Oysters roasted with a chipotle BBQ sauce and cilantro-onion relish.  This was just ok.  I really couldn't taste the Oysters at all because the sauce was too overpowering.  It would be better on shrimp or something with more flavor.  (There was at least a good tablespoon of sauce per oyster.  A teaspoon would easily have been enough for these bivalves...)\n\n*Mango Tapioca Pudding- GREAT dessert!  The pudding had no mango flavor itself; instead, mango puree was poured over the top.  The pudding was extremely well-made: rich and insanely creamy.  We could discern a hint of almond flavor in it.  \n\nI highly reccomend you stop in when you are in the mood for a great, but fairly quick meal.  You shouldn't be in here for more than 1 hour.  1.5 max.  There is really no ambience, scene, or service to be relished- just good food.", "author": "Robert B."}

Usually Asian fusion doesn't fill you up because its all about presentation and high prices. Yeah sure, this place has plenty of presentation and a pretty high price but it definitely leaves your stomach satisfied. I had the Niman Ranch pork chops which were delicious and extremely tender, the amazing pomegranate currant sauce was the icing on the meat (haha). I'd recommend the grilled sea bass and the angus ribeye steak, that always pleases the taste buds. I always get the creme brulee here simply because I am a fan of great creme brulee but one thing that you have to do is ask for the sauce on the side. They top the creme brulee with a passionfruit puree which is sour to an intensity that you will cringe to its sharp taste. Nevertheless an amazing restaurant and it deserves nothing less than five stars. \nOne improvement I would like to see is that the waitresses smile once in a while. I mean they look trained to be in the military except they memorize daily specials rather than the army general orders.", "author": "Ryan L."}

I was truly excited to try this place out after checking out pics of the food online and hearing the rave, rave review from friends!\n\nIt was an extremely rainy evening the nite we went so the drive from the East Bay to the City took much longer than planned.  To be polite, we called the resto to let them know we were running late.  Needless to say, I had to drop my cousin off because it took me another 25 minutes to find parking.  Parking in this area during prime dinner hour (7pm) is THE WORST!\n\nGiven that the resto is in North Beach, I expected the space to be small and small it was.  Agree with another Yelper - I would not recommend this place for parties or groups of more than 4 as it is a very tight squeeze between tables.\n\nFood was VERY good, but oddly enough that is not what left an impression on me.  It was part of our service (our waitress) that was not-so-good.  When I finally got into the resto, my cousin mentioned how she apologized to the staff for our tardiness and that I was parking the car.  10 minutes into looking for parking, I called my cousin (already seated at a table) and told her to order 2 appetizers to get our meal going.  My intention was to shore up time we lost by arriving late.  Apparently, when she ordered the appetizers the server made some snide comment about 'this being the reason why they do not like to seat people if the entire party is not present.\"  From that point on the service by this waitress (Asian gal, didn't get her name) sucked eggs.  She took our food order and seemed to rush off, she didn't come back to check on us and while I was ordering dessert...I had not yet fnished ordering and she already walked away to tend to another table.  To top it off, I watched her wait on other tables to the left & right of us and she was extremely courteous and helpful to them, but whenever she was at our table the charade was dropped.\n\nLOOK...we called to say we were late, we even ordered appetizers to get the meal going even though I was not present AND we are paying customers like everyone else.  We don't need to be treated like royalty, but we deserved the same respect and courtesy everyone else was afforded.  We were contrite, apologetic customers who were trying to help this waitress out by being prepared whenever she was at our table and did our best to not linger at the table because we could see you had customers lined up at the door.  Unfortunately her panties remained in a fat bunch from the moment we arrived late.\n\nNeedless to say, I am no longer excited about this place.  As good as the food was, you will NEVER find me returning to this establishment because of THAT stinkin' waitress.\n\nP.S.  Yeah, I probably should have complained to the mgmt, but I guess I didn't want to deal with it that nite.  Instead, I've chosen to put them on blast via Yelp.", "author": "Aurelie N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-12-01", "description": "Completely overrated.  We have eaten at the restaurant a few times, but parking is not good, so we order takeout.  We USED to order takeout but painfully by principle have sworn it off ( i will explain below). \n\n\n\nIf you eat there once, and you don't eat Sea Bass or Cod often, you will be impressed because the fish, not the preparation, is special.  Sea Bass is always \"melt in your mouth\" good/rich/etc if you know how to pick and cook your fish.  If you eat at the house a few times, then you will start to notice:\n1.  food is fresh, but prepared pretty bland even for those of us who are healthy eaters.  temperature is challenged for ???reason.  \n2.  sashimi appetizer offerings are not even near top tier SF levels.\n3.  even if you have a reservation, you will stand awkwardly in the doorway for way longer than you should because they have a poorly organized reservation system.\n4.  if you are seated near the door, you have been profiled.  the door constantly opens and people do not close it well, so you get inundated with drafts of cold air throughout your meal.  also, outside your window seat, it's like a live crime scene in progress.  crackheads are often seeing propositioning each other, quarrelling, smoking, puking (yup), etc.  the beautiful people are seated more inside the restaurant.  i noticed this when i used to wait for my takeout.  \n5.  none of the waitstaff ever crack a smile.\n6.  So back to takeout.  We were underwhelmed with the food enough that we only went for the mango tapioca-- excellent dessert, awesome treat.  2 orders to go.  regularly.  prob once a week or so.  \n\nSo this is why i do not go to The House anymore. \n1.  I takeout the mango tapioca regularly enough that i know that the owner with the frizzy hair is aware.  A few of the staff are excellent and deserving of their tip.  however, on two occasions i asked for the dessert to be ready because of the parking situation so i can run in/out.  twice the person on the phone insisted that i had to come in and then they would make it.  so then whay call it in?  where to park?  they clearly are apathetic about repeat customers, even if just in appreciation for dessert.  \nso i stopped going. \n\n2.  the clincher:  my GF's BFF came in from L.A. and wanted to come to the restaurant.  We made a reservation well in advance.  When we called to change the number of people in the reservation, they said OK. then we get a call the day BEFORE the reservation-- hostess asking where we were.  we tell her the reservation is for tomorrow.  then she loses, finds, loses, finds the reservation.  finally, they are booked for the day we were originally supposed to be scheduled.  we are professionals.  we make appointments and we do not miss them or confuse dates--ever.  we were both present when res was made.  on a tapioca run, i explained to the owner how rude her staff was, and how unreasonable it was to get so easily confused about the reservation.  the owner basically said she doesnt really care, and threw it back in my face.  she said, \"Yeah it happens.  it's a loud restaurant and mistakes happen.\"  no attempt to perhaps reassure us for next time.  we were not asking for free food or anything silly like that.  i really would have felt better if she had simply acknowledged that we should be treated better for being local and appreciating the dessert enough that we stop by every week.  Nothing.  silence + crickets and the stare of apathy.  \n\nat first i ordered dinner out a few times, but realized it was a subtle fail.  \nthe mango tapioca is the best dessert in the city,  but top tier restaurants in SF are much more professional, as the house has very poor customer service.  as much as i love the dessert, i am not going to go back.  \n\ncan anyone tell me if i am crazy or are Raulf W's reviews written as an artistic interpretation of the english language, a joke, or simply all wrong?", "author": "eshwar k."}

Not to say that everything wasn't excellent, but there were some small details that keep it from getting that last star.\r\n\r\nTonight, a group of five of us rolled in for our 7pm reservation on time - but as is typical these days, the table wasn't ready. Take note restauranteurs: make sure you're budgeting enough time for table turnover, especially in small restaurants. But I digress... we waited about 20 minutes, dodging obnoxious panhandlers who just didn't get the hint, before getting the table.\r\n\r\nThe food and wine was very good, possibly even fantastic but not outstanding. The very amiable waiter ran down the specials  and brought us our bottle of 2003 Elk Cove Pinot Noir (only mentioned by name because it is a great Pinot for the price, and so I'll remember it in the morning).\r\n\r\nI started with a classic Hot and Sour soup with Manila clams. This was a perfect hit, as I love good Hot and Sour soup and I love Manila clams - and the combination of both was unique and exceptional: spicy with a delicate seafood note.\r\n\r\nThe \"Wagyu Skirt Steak with Mashed Potatoes\" wasn't that at all, but it was still a fantastic main course. Instead, it was actually a Wagyu Flank Steak, cooked perfectly to my specification of rare, with a beef and truffle reduction and served with a small bowl of white rice, which was a much better starch for this dish than the aforementioned mashed potatos. A quarter point was taken off for the white asparagus, which was a little underdone, but it was still one of the best steak dishes I have had in a long time.\r\n\r\nDessert was a plum crisp with vanilla ice cream - a dish that is reminiscent of a Bavarian dessert whose name I can no longer recall - simple and very, very tasty. Take another quarter-point off for a lack of an espresso maker - de rigeur in San Francisco and especially in North Beach.\r\n\r\nHouse won't give food lovers a life changing meal, but it is great food - better than ever expected in North Beach.", "author": "Avery G."}

Showed the website and photos to my wife, whose immediate response was \"oh my god, that's the most pretentious thing I've ever seen.\"  \n\nShe was right, of course - House is terribly pretentious in its menu and especially in its plating; crab cakes piled like little fried snowmen with giant slices of veggie sticking out the top like feathers in a pimp's hat, slices of flash-fried salmon arranged around a central pillar of rice, and so forth.  It's all very modern and artsy, which is why I was surprised at how down to earth the clientele was - largely out of towners - \"Sacramento\" out-of-town, not \"Macon, GA\" out-of-town, although this may have been due to the time of day.  \n\nI had the angus steak and it was outstanding.  Wife had the Ahi Tuna, which was also rather good.  We split two appetizers; the scallops were sensational, and the other thing was kind of overshadowed, to the point where I have to stop and remember what it was.  Salmon, I think.

Happy 4th decade bday buddy!  Our friend Kevin had a couple of wine bottles, but the bday boy and I already had enough booz for his bday last Friday.  However, peer pressure from these guys usually wins over my response of \"HEEELLS NO!\" to alcohol.  This is probably the 4th time I've been here and was never dissappointed.  For appetizers, we had the salmon egg rolls and it was pretty good, but my friend's sister in law made it better, but now I know where they got the idea from.  We also had the unagi with avocado sushi rice and it was also pretty good.  It definitely tastes better than sushi restaurants's unagi sushi.  The last appetizer was complimentary scallop with some fruity sauce and it was perfectly cooked.  For entrees, my friend and I had the black cod and it was good.  The 4 decade bday boy...oops...man...had the kurobuta pork chop and it was probably the best pork chop I've ever had and was cooked to perfection.  Chan H had the sea bass and that was pretty good too.  For dessert, we had their very popular mango tapioca and creme brulee.  Mango tapioca was delicious and the creme brulee was pretty good.  However, near the end of our desserts, I did have a slight bad end to the dinner.  A man sat down on the table next to me and all of a sudden I get a whiff of some super strong, disgusting, pungent, and old smell.  It was the guy's cologne!  Holy crap Batman!  Someone get me a gas mask, because I'm about to pass out!  It was far worse than the Chinese tiger oil balm \"bok fa yau\" that my mom and grandparents used to use when they feel sick.  I couldn't stay in my seat and had to get some air to get away from that cologne.\n\nOverall, this place is very consistent, which is probably one of my most important factors in a restaurant.  Service was very attentive in filling up the glasses of water and cleaning up the plates.

If you order a rib eye, it can only be incrementally better than what you've had before - - know what I mean? Anyway..\nOrder the special appetizers - Scallops, and Hamachi Salad. The Hamachi was good, high quality - with a tiny bit of nori and a great dressing and fresh baby arugula, it was very tasty. But I'm glad we ate that first, because the Scallops were simply awesome! fantastic sauce, just barely seared and tender, tender, tender. wow. I'll be ordering that again. \nI had the special Black Cod and my bud had the wasabi noodles with rib eye. The noodles were pretty good, and the wasabi accent made it interesting. The noodles looked handmade. Nice rich sauce. The steak was very good - cooked just right medium rare. \nThe Black Cod was awesome! I'd never had such a soft almost spongy fish before. And it had the crispy seared skin too! I have no idea how they pulled that off. Please note - this is NOT the sea bass - that looked good too, but that's more the regular flaky awesome fish. The cod was sublimely soft and almost the consistency of pudding. I realize that might sound *different*, and it is. Just have an open mind and you'll be blown away.

I am infinitely sorry, The House. I promise I still love you and my lack of reviewing has no bearing on how much awe I am in of your food. \n\nI have been to The House probably 3 or 4 times, and now that I'm living in SoCal, I miss it so much. The most recent time was on a visit to SF, and we took our amazing friends there to thank them for letting us crash in their living room :). Needless to say, The House, as usual, did not disappoint. My hubby, my friend, and her husband each got a different kind of fish, and I got the wasabi noodles and steak. We all tasted each other's and I have to tell you, EVERYTHING was amazing. I honestly could not pick out a top or a bottom because it truly was all THAT GOOD. The fish was so buttery and perfectly cooked, and my wasabi noodles, standard, were perfectly seasoned and prepared. We also got two appetizers: a crab cake and scallops. Hubby and I split the scallops... and wow. They were unbelievable. I could eat those scallops every. single. day. Our friends really loved their crab cake--not surprising though, as I don't know if The House knows how to make something sub-par. In fact, our friends (who still live in SF--lucky!!) went back to The House recently because they were *that* impressed. They ordered the crab cake again--they liked it that much! \n\nOverall, The House has never ever disappointed. It is definitely high quality food for prices that are really reasonable for SF and the quality of food you are receiving. It is not, however, a place where you should go to have a very lengthy, drawn out, romantic meal. They are pleasant, helpful, efficient, and quick... as well as packed, always. So, know that you will come here to eat and visit with your company, and they will not rush you out... but you will leave once you finish your meal. You also MUST have reservations. I'm not sure if they take walk-ins, but we have always gone on a weekend night and if you are going then (Fri/Sat), regardless of the time, MAKE A RESERVATION.

I dragged my chomping buddy along and after finding a space only a quarter of a mile away, we popped our heads into the tiny space of the House.  A half hour wait for a table was lazed away with Grey Goose Poire on the rocks just 3 doors up.    When we came back, we were promplty seated and the memories of more youthful days came flooding back.  \n\nOur service was spot on.   Our server had a party of 13 to serve along with about five other 2-4 top tables.  We never felt neglected and had a great meal.  The oysters arrived with a bit of additional DNA (i.e. a strand of hair) and was quickly zipped away - not only was the hippie oyster (i hope you realize that i almost wrote \"hairy oyster\", oops, just did.) replaced, but, a whole new plate was brought out without any question - and slurped down in seconds.  Friend's crab cake was really really good.\n\nI had the black cod -- it was crispy on the outside and juicy yumminess in the center.   The seabass was as good as I thought it would be.

It was not quite as amazing as say Bakesale Betty's or Boccanova's but it was certainly good and with a more Asian fried chicken flavor. The chicken on it's own was good enough. I had a tuna BLT which was also good but didn't really work as a sandwich because it was just too messy. Flavor wise it was fine though.  We shared a warm kale salad which was one of the best salads I've ever had.  I'm not a big salad guy but this was truly divine.

When one spends $120 for dinner for two, I would hope you would be allowed to dine at a leisurely pace. I love the food and the staff is nice, but unless they start slowing down their service, I will stop coming. Hope they see the light. I would rate you at 4+ stars if you would improve speedy service.", "author": "Robert H."}

The space is small, though, and it felt a little bit cramped with our party of six.\n\nThe location great if you like being in the heart of crazy North Beach, but don't drive - especially if its pouring rain and the night before the Chinese New Year Flower Fair.

I've been here a number of times for dinner and the food's always been great. This time decided to try it for lunch. \n\nThe unagi avocado sandwich sounded really strange but it tasted fantastic with the tasty fresh unagi and avocade slides on toasted bread with a special sauce. It came with a side salad but the sandwich and salad were both pretty small so order an appetizer too if you are really hungry. The curry noodles were decent but came with a curry sauce that was a bit too creamy. The wasabi noodles were also decent and definitely had a nice spicy kick to it but wasn't spectacular.\n\nBottom line: Great unagi avo sandwich. The other dishes were just ok. Not the best I've had at The House this time compared to past times.  But I'll definitely come back and try again another time. 3.5 stars.", "author": "Jim C."}

When I arrived, the tiny place was almost packed, with a couple of tables for 2 left.  It was already a pleasure browsing all the different dishes on the other tables.  All the appetizers looked great and we quickly decided that we would order 4 appetizers to start with.  The server did a great job in serving 2 dishes after 2 -- and complete replaced our plates and dining wares in between dishes.\n\nMussels w/ garlic sauce -- 4.5 stars (They are actually clams, not mussels.  I wish the clams were bigger, but the sauce was excellent, will order again.)\n\nTuna Tar-tare - 4.5 stars (Very nicely displayed and fresh/refreshing)\n\nCrab cake - 5 stars. Period.  (Will definitely order again)\n\nDeep fried Salmon Roll - 4 stars.  Served very hot and crispy with wasabi sauce.  However, I probably like the Firecracker Salmon Roll from Cheesecake Factory much better.\n\nAfter 4 appetizers, we were about half full, so we just ordered one entree to share -- which was the server-recommended Seared Sea bass.  I have to say the sea bass could have been seared more crisp and the fish could have been juicier for a $24 dish.  The noodles and beans on the side, on the other hand, tasted really good.\n\nWe finished off with two desserts:\nMango Tapioca  (The name sounds really yummy, yet we regretted for ordering this.  It's basically a creamy mix of tapioca with mango SYRUP)\n\nCoconut Creme Brulee with Passion fruit flavor.  This one is a great 5 stars!

The Classic Calamari appetizer was like any other calamari you'd order at a typical restaurant; nothing outstanding, but a nice start. I'd recommend the Deep Fried Salmon Roll (w/ spicy hot mustard) as another appetizer. My bf normally doesn't like salmon, but he loved the roll. Be careful not to dip it in too much mustard because they put a good amount of wasabi in it so if you're not expecting it, your nose will feel almost like you've been snorting crack with Whitney Houston.\n\nThe Grilled Seabass w/ garlic ginger soy made me extremely happy during and after eating it. Such a generous portion and also came with string beans perfectly cooked and warm sesame noodles. The seabass was seared just right and not over-cooked. This entree is a winner. The Mushroom Rice w/ Grilled Prawns was good even though it didn't have a hint of asian flavor in it. It tasted more like a delicious buttery Italian dish for prawn lovers.

Always make reservations for Friday and Saturday otherwise you may not even get a chance to wait for a table.  Because of the small size of the restaurant I really wouldn't suggest a party of more than 6.\n\nThe food is always amazing.  They have very creative specials changing every week, and each of them sound so tantalizing I always order at least one special each time I go.  The appetizers are usually enough for only two people, but you can ask the wait staff to alter the price and amount of food for each appetizer to fit the number of people in your party.\n\nThey do have a pretty modest wine list and the prices are quite reasonable.  Their desserts are also very delicious and sometimes they run out on a busy night.  All in all I would say that The House is definitely a great place to show off to your friends that you know where some really good food is made.\n\nAlso for a side note, depending on the night, it can be very noisy so expect to talk with a bit more volume when you go.

Ceviche was the special of the night, girlfriend loved it, reminded her of Mama's fishouse on Maui(which by the way I recommend to everyone and anyone, get the after work cocktail, 1 was all I needed!), I on the other hand was much more attracted to the fried chicken liver salad.

I got the pork chop with Pomegranate sauce, and O'ed her back.  \n\nLet me tell you just how unbelievable that pork chop was, I'm not messing around, this pork chop changed my life.  First let's just start with the basics.  Grilled Pork chop, simple yeah? all you gotta do is keep it moist, and make sure it's fresh.  Done. Next is the sauce, the pomegranate sauce from heaven.  It's like a highly sophisticated BBQ sauce, think...cowboy with an english accent.  Together...ohhh.....Now, let's move on to the mashed potatos with the chinese mustard sauce, mustard? mashed potatos? what the? yes, weird, and oddly, flavorfully orgasmic.  Last we have the thinly fried plantains, perfect width, perfect crispiness, and perfect combination.

The sea bass and butterfish are consistently good.

Basically, the seafood and the meats have been delish every time; don't even know if they do poultry dishes but I'm sure they would be good. The deserts seem to be pretty straightforward and simple but after all the appetizer and entree goodness, it's nice to have a nice simple finish to your dinner. The creme brulee is always a favorite, and I'm a big fan of the apple pie equivalent the have for desert. \n\nBecause it's North Beach, take a cab.

I had never heard of it, but apparently it's a small but popular neighborhood destination for 20 somethings.  Despite being seated less than a foot from the tables adjacent to our two top, I had a great time.  After waiting about 45 minutes (no reservation on a Saturday night), we were seated and all skepticism was methodically put to rest.\n\nI was immediately a critic of the size of the restaurant, but they compensate with a high quality dining experience.  I'm not just talking about the food here, it's all the little things: menu selections, service, and ambience.  I was surprised to see that most entrees were $20 or less, considering the type of ingredients put into play.  This included an impressive array of fish and even foie gras!  The service was definitely up to par as well.  Our server was very attentive, especially and most importantly with the drinks.  The interior has a very neutral but contemporary feel, with heavy use of woodgrain that is complimentary to the overall image they are trying to achieve.\n\nWhenever I hear \"Asian fusion,\" I can't help but roll my eyes in dismay reminiscing on less-than-exceptional cuisine from Dr. Frankenstein's monster known as PF Chang's.  However, The House's chefs have done a great job of blending a selection of Asian inspired ingredients that can also be found locally.  I like to think of it as Californian cuisine.  We ordered the mussels in a spicy broth, which was unusual but delicious.  I ordered the soy glazed salmon in sake broth while she opted for her old faithful, flat iron steak with wasabe? noodles.  The steak was amazingly flavorful and cooked a perfect medium rare.  My salmon was very savory as well and went great with the broth.  I was impressed with the presentation of the dish: the salmon resting on a bed of greens so as not to become soggy in the broth and garnished with a spoonful of tobiko, cleverly resembling caviar.\n\nMost importantly, the beer and wine selection was surprisingly diverse.  There were more than a couple international brews that I wasn't familiar with at all, but I ended up sticking with some Japanese rice ale.  It was what Robin is to Batman.\n\nOverall, the experience was an exceptional value.  Classy without being pretentious.

However, it truly is that wonderful.  The food is amazing and so pretty to look at.  It's a small place to it's wise to make reservations or come really early or late in the evening.  Parking is a real pain so it's better to just take Muni or use a garage.\n\nThe waitstaff is very friendly and efficient.  Almost too efficient; we had a three course meal and were out of there in an hour.  We didn't feel rushed, but you could tell the servers have been serving the same things for a while and knew the menu pretty well.  They did have a few specials, but they were too complicated for the waiters to recite properly, so I think it would have been better if they were printed on inserts in the menu.\n\nWe started out with a glass of Riesling for myself and my luver had the black lychee iced tea that came with refills.  I really liked my wine and felt it matched well with the food we ordered.  The menu isn't large, but it was really hard to decide what to get since so many things looked appetizing.\n\nFor the starters, we had the deep fried salmon roll with hot mustard sauce.  For some reason I had it in my head that I was going to get something like an egg roll.  Instead, we got long whole pieces of salmon (skin-on) with a light friend coating.  It was terrific!  I'm normally not a fan of hot mustard, but the dip was really good (if you used just a bit).  Too much and it burns your nose.  We also ordered the crabcake.  It was pear-shaped - very unique!  It was very good and I loved the lemony oil that was drizzled on the plate.\n\nFor my entree, I got the sea bass.  I had read so many good things about it.  I was thrilled that it came with two of my favorite side dishes....green beans and noodles.  The sea bass wasn't the best I have ever had, but it was still very good.  The fish was tender and moist.  The green beans were sauteed in a savory brown sauce with a hint of garlic.  They were crisp and perfectly cooked.  The noodles were really yummy, too; they were thick like udon and very chewy.  My luver had the Angus rib-eye steak.  It was one of the BEST steaks I have ever had.  He asked for it medium rare and it came out simply perfect.  The meat was so tender and almost melted in your mouth.  This dish came with a side of mashed potatoes and bok choy.  The mashed potatoes tasted strange to me, but who cares...the steak was awesome!!!!\n\nFor dessert, I had the special: strawberry and burnt orange upside down cake, which I liked a lot.  My luver got the chocolate truffle cake with coffee ice cream.  The cake was super thick and rich.  Delicious!\n\nThe bill post-tax/pre-tip came out to $100.  Although it wasn't cheap, I felt it was reasonable for 2 apps, 2 entrees, 2 desserts, and two drinks.  The quality of food here is superb.  The portions at House are generous as well.

I took my babe out to a congratulatory-new-job dinner and it was a total hit. \n\nThe highlights of the meal were the Ahi Tuna Tartare and the Apple crumble dessert.  I love tuna tartare, and The House made it inventive and delicious. I've been trying to skip dessert lately, but we were celebrating. If you love more crumbs than apples in your Apple Crumb pie, then this is going to definitely hit the spot.  I loved it!\n\nAs for the rest of the meal, we also ordered the scallop appetizer which was good but not momentous. My boyfriend got the Skirt Steak with wasabi noodles. We both noted that there was nothing wasabi about those noodles. I ordered the famous sea bass and, agreeing with the rest of the reviews below, it was done to perfection. The noodles and green beans that were on my side were a little too greasy for my taste, but the fish was perfect. \n\nAmbiance was cool, we got the seat next to the window and had early reservations so it wasn't uncomfortably packed. \n\nAll around, it was a delicious meal and I would recommend it to anyone.", "author": "Tien H."}

However, if you're on a quest for deliciously well-prepared food served up in a small-space, energetic, people-packed environment...hunt down this place.\n\nSure it's loud. Sure you walk in and wait in this tiny corner while they prep a table (near a crazy-ass door that has a hydraulic mind of its own).  And sure, it's tightly packed. But in this case, the juice is worth the squeeze (literally.)\n\nSo once you've checked out their high-tech and well-designed website (http://www.thehse.com) you might actually be skeptical. However you see the photos, read the menu and put your Asian-Fusion Yummy Cap on - and the salivation begins.\n\nTry this navigation on for size:\n- 1 part deep fried salmon roll app (dont' be shy with the hot mustard)\n- 1 part Asian sweet and crispy ribs app (if they have 'em on the specials. And go ahead and steal the hot mustard from the salmon roll for these too! haha. Go hot mustard!)\n- Either the Kobe Beef w/ pomegranate reduction or the monkfish for entrees\n- Don't forget a decent sake to compliment the Asian flavors on your palate. \n\nThus far I can't brag enough to say that every order on this strong menu is going to be a homer, but if the menu above sets the pace - then we're all in for a treat. \n\nSo why not the 5 star? Front of house was a bit off. Reservations were backed up (understandably in this small joint timing has got to be a massive pain) so we got to rub elbows a lot waiting in the corner for our seats and a couple of the specials were not available. Sure that's picky, but gotta lead with high standards I suppose.\n\nSo, despite my pickiness don't let it deter you. Think fusion. Think Eurpoean-close. Think high-energy.

I visited this place once when it was on Irving and it wasn't that great.  The place was definitely not popping.  Moving to North Beach was probably the best thing they did for the restaurant.  I must say though, the space is much smaller, but that definitely does not mean the flavors are small.\n\nMade reservations the night before for a party of 5, for a week night.  They had the table ready when we arrived.  The waiter we had was clearly new, so it was slightly awkward.  We ordered the oysters on the half shell, got two people who never had them to try it.  They were 'okay' with it.  I personally, love oysters on the half shell, so it was a perfect appetizer.  I ordered their lychee black tea and well, it was bland.  If putting one lychee in the tea makes it a drink, I guess it counts, but really really bland.  I knew someone working at the restaurant, so he brought me another one, with 3 lychee and that really didn't help that much more.  Eating the lychee was enjoyable, but drinking it was a lot less...they should add the syrup from the canned lychee.  We also ordered the ceasar with fried scallops as another appetizer to share and it was a good basic ceasar salad.\n\nI ordered their roasted chicken breast with portabello mushrooms and the skin was nice and crispy, while the chicken was still moist.  The mushrooms were also very yummy.  The rest of the party order the mushroom rice with shrimp, the porkchops with pomegranet (spelling?) sauce, and the sirloin steak.  All of the dishes were very well prepared.  Great flavors with contrasting textures.  We however, did not stay for dessert.\n\nDespite the drink lacking flavoring, the rest of the meal overall was wonderful.  I can only imagine how busy this place gets on weekends.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-06-08", "description": "This place missed the mark for me, but only in regards to a few things.  I used to sling around my 5-stars, but I've started holding out as I have tried to provide more accurate ratings based off of Yelp's standards.\n\nAfter watching a play with my friend, we called The House and made a reservation.  Somehow we were able to make reservations in the next 15 minutes, so I was happy.  We found parking a couple blocks away, thankfully, and made our way to the restaurant.  They don't really have a waiting area, other than a small area by the door or outside.  \n\nWe didn't have to wait too long after our previously informed time, and were seated rather quickly.  I was highly intrigued by the type of food, but I quickly realized that \"fusion\" was a loosely used term.  For instance, the first place they stumbled was with the starter they provided to us.  It essentially was a standard Chinese appetizer, yet it was made extremely poorly.  It really isn't that hard to soak cucumber in soy, sesame seeds, and vinegar.  It seemed as if they had just whipped it together without letting the flavors soak into the cucumber and soften it up.  For me, this was the first stumble.  If you're going to have \"fusion\" food, then fuse it.  Don't just make a mediocre version of an authentic dish.\n\nThe oysters we ordered were amazing--absolutely amazing.  They brought out six, and after having my second one I was happy.  Then my third one floored me.  It literally took my mood and slammed it on the floor and said, \"HA!  You thought this was good, but we fooled you.\"  My last one tasted like it was just fished out of the river.  If I wanted river-flavored food, I would go to the river and get it myself.  The House, you were extremely close, but you missed that mark here.\n\nThe second appetizer we had was the unagi. It was basically a standard version of unagi you order at a sushi restaurant.  It was nothing special, and nothing truly shined about it.  The rice I make at home is better than what they used, but it's a moot point.\n\nOn to the entr\u00e9es...\n\nThe wasabi noodles with steak was actually tasty, but it was missing a vital ingredient, spice.  I flagged down the server and requested more of the sauce that came with our oysters.  Once she brought it out, I dumped the entire ramiken of sauce into my noodles and it just opened up my palate.  The entire dish seemed to sing after that.  If the dish had come out like this, then I would have overlooked the oyster and mediocre starter in order to give them 5 stars.  \n\nAll-in-all, this is a great place to come with a date.  It's quaint, homey, and has a great atmosphere.  I would certainly come back, but they need to step up their game a little bit in order for that elusive fifth star from me.\n\nAs a side note, my friend had one of the ahi tuna dishes.  What I tried of his was mediocre at best.  It was missing something vital as well, but it was my dish to correct.  He was extremely happy with it, but then again he'll eat anything.  Anyways, it just factors into my point I mentioned earlier of finding the missing elements of the dishes and this place will be absolutely amazing.", "author": "Brent A."}

It's a very small and crowded place to begin with, so we were cramped, but okay.  I'm pleased they accommodated our last minute change, but this is not the place to linger over drinks due to the minimal space leads to some discomfort.\nAlso, they have 1 bathroom and you have to wait in line by the dish station, so wait staff is constantly squeezing by you.

We'd eaten there once before and liked their menu because it was a) tasty and b) distinct from the American, French, and Italian cuisine we usually have when we go out.\n\nI had a hankering for teriyaki sauce, so I was adamant about getting the roasted unagi with avocado sushi rice for my appetizer.  For my entr\u00e9e, I figured I couldn't go wrong with an angus ribeye steak covered in teriyaki and garlic butter.  My boyfriend, who had the perspicacity to ask about the dinner specials, ordered the Caesar salad with crispy scallops for his appetizer and a kobe steak with udon noodles and mashed potatoes that was not mentioned on the menu.  \n\n(Note: when ordering from The House, remember to ask about the specials, as there will probably be several good ones on any given night that are not indicated on the menu.)\n\nThe scallops and unagi were great, but the steaks fell far short of expectations.  For starters, they got cold on the walk between the restaurant and our apartment, and I was too hungry to wait for the three minutes it would have taken to heat them up.  The walk home had also jostled the sauce off the meat; the sauce had collected in the corners of the take-out boxes and refused to re-connect with the steak.  When I finally started eating, I discovered that my angus was semi-tough and veined with sinewy fat.  I tested every part of the cut and spat out every other piece I chewed.  The boyfriend's kobe was only marginally better in terms of fat content, and he ended up sharing it with me.  All in all, our steaks were sub-par by any decent restaurant's standards, and considering what we paid for them, we felt gypped.  I think it's safe to say that we'll be avoiding steaks from The House from now on.\n\nIn spite of our bad experience with the steak, I would still recommend eating at The House as they have some unique, tasty stuff that I haven't seen anywhere else.", "author": "Niya Y."}

When my friends ask me to recommend a restaurant for date night, The House is usually on my list of recommendations with the disclaimer that everyone else in SF loves The House except for me.

That being direct and honest is not always appreciated.  We did not have a reservation and she said I can seat you now if you can finish, eat and pay and be done in an hour.  She sat another group next to our table and she said, to save time can I read the specials and soup of the day to you both now to save time? We said sure, yah...ok  to all the rushing...but in a way I feel a classier restaurant would not have even put that out there, it really just made the ambiance of the place feel un welcome and cold...Speaking of, my friends steak was cold.  The server said we are fast here...and I feel like everything mustve been prepared ahead of time and just breifly re heated because after we ordered the food literally came out in less than 5 minutes!  Jack in the Box isn't even that fast. The quality of the food has suffered tremendously.", "author": "Charla M."}

I was impressed with the the mostly grilled / pan seared meats fused with distinctively Chinese and Japanese seasoning and sauces.  \n\n I decided to revisit the House 10 years later to see if the food is as good as I remembered.  We started with 2 excellent appetizers - Unagi with Orzo and Monterey Calamari with a spicy tomato sauce.  The Unagi was a generous piece of eel charbroiled to perfection.  The flavor was smoky and slightly sweet.  There is a trace of Avocado between the Unagi and the Orzo.  The Calamari was also Charbroiled drenched in a slightly spicy smoky tomato sauce.  \n\nFor the mains, we ordered a seared Hamachi (yellow tail) with a crab sushi roll over yu-choi (Chinese Greens) and Ginger Soy Sea Bass with Fresh noodles and Chinese Long Beans.\n\nThe Sea Bass was excellent.  The fish was moist, buttery.  The ginger sauce,  served on the side, was good.  The fresh Chinese noodles which were lightly stir-fried, had a very nice texture, although just a touch greasy.  \n\nThe seared Yellow Tail was more ordinary as were the crab sushi rolls that came with it.  The fish was slightly over seared /cooked for my taste.  It was closer to medium well rather than medium rare, what I expect of seared fish. \n\nThe verdict?  The food is still very good, although not quite as good as I remembered.  The vegetables and noodles, although very good, were a touch too greasy especially in combination with the Sea Bass which is a oily, high-fat content fish.   \n\nThe price was very reasonable.  We spent around $45 per person including a large bottle of Pellegrino tip and tax.\n\nThe House is a small restaurant and it's still a popular place even after all these years.  It's in the heart of North Beach so parking is very difficult.  If you decide to try The House, go early or make a reservation before you go.", "author": "Paul K."}

The wifey always gets the seared sea bass with garlic noodles.

I came out of the restaurant suprised and very satisfied. We (3 people) started off with the bbq chipotle grilled oysters with cilantro. Bbq sauce was a little strong for the briney oyster, but you can't go wrong with fresh oysters. Then we shared 3 entrees (seared tuna, grilled sea bass, and the porkchop). The seared tuna and sea bass was very typical. Served with an asian sauce (soy/ginger and chinese mustard sauce) it was tasty but easily forgetable. The pork chop however was on another level. Grilled to a perfect medium (slightly pink center), it was served with an amazing sauce of currant/pomegranate reduction. The pork was also topped off with more pomegranate seeds. The smoky charred pork with the sweet reduction made a very standard sounding dish (pork w/ a sweet reduction) taste extraordinary. Service was a 2-3 stars (very busy, slow).

I would give it a 5 except for the service - we did have to wait a bit, and he didn't want to take the time to allow us to ask questions really.\n\nThey do have a lot of specials, we had 3 apps (fresh calamari, chicken liver salad and clams), 2 of the special mains (kobe steak and black cod) and 3 deserts (creme brulee, chocolate torte, apple pie).\n\nIt was all absolutely delicious, great champagne, good wine, an excellent choice anytime!", "author": "Lara L."}

Our server was friendly, but not overly friendly.  A nice, cozy atmosphere.  Too cozy, evidently, as the girl seated at the next table saw fit to TAKE HER SHOES OFF.  I loved the look our server shot her as he stumbled over her shoes and then kicked them back under her table. \nWTF is wrong with people? This is the third person I've seen take their shoes off in a restaurant.  Oh well, at least she didn't take her napkin and wipe her bare feet off like I witnessed in the sushi restaurant.  \n\nOh yeah, the food.  We started with the fried salmon rolls and the tuna tartare.  The tuna tartare was mouth-wateringly delicious.  The salmon rolls didn't do much for me (they seemed a little dry) but everyone else at the table went wild for them. They did come with a deliciously spicy wasabi sauce that redeemed them considerably.\n\nWe then split three entrees.  Based on the recommendations here, we had the sea bass, the pork chop with pomegranate sauce, and the hamachi special that had the sushi rolls on top.  They were all wonderful.  The pork chop was thick and really juicy, cooked perfectly in a delicious pomegranate sauce.  I highly recommend this dish, but really, I thought they were all excellent.  Both fish dishes were also great, and the sauces were wonderful.\n\nWe also split the chocolate cake, which came with ice cream.  The cake was delicious, with very dense chocolate; the creme brulee, which had a perfect crispy, crackly crust, and the tapioca pudding.  The pudding was delicious, but seemed a little soup-y compared to other tapiocas I'd had in the past. \n\nAll in all, great service, great food in a cozy atmosphere.  We'll definitely be back.

I was more than pleasantly surprised with this restaurant. Some of the fusion dishes, particularly the fried salmon roll with what appeared to be mustard, was something I had never experienced. The mussels, tuna tartare and dumplings were also well executed but certainly not unique to my dining experience. The appetizers/small plates on the whole appeared to more exciting to me the entrees of sea bass (good) and flat iron steak (above average). The wasabi flavor to the noodles that accompanied the steak was barely perceptible and certainly I would have appreciated a robust influence of the wasabi. Total cost for three people with a few beers thrown in was around $120. This is definitely a restaurant worth returning to and I would certainly explore the remaining small plates and appetizers.", "author": "Procter F."}

Goes well with a glass of the riesling.\n\nAs I was busy marveling at the food this last time, I suppose I wasn't really paying attention to the service...As my wife pointed out, the wait staff does not really check in on you to see how you like your food.

My date enjoyed it, but I prefer the crab cakes with lumpy, large portions of actual crab meat. Not the mixed/processed crab meat with filler. That's just me, we actually though it had a good portion for $10. \n\nPork belly appetizer. Liked it very much. It reminds me of a traditional chinese dish. The fat to lean ratio was about 50/50, I guess that was a good thing. The pork belly dish I usually order is about 85 fat /15 lean and with skin. The sauce was good and the crispness of the lean meat put it over the top, very tasty. \n\nMy main dish was the flatiron steak with wasabi noodles. I would not order it again. It wasn't a bad combination and the lady next to our table seem to have enjoyed it. The steak was cooked exactly as I asked, medium rare. I guess I just didn't dig the cut of the meat. I'm a porter and rib eye kinda guy. The noodles were ok, I ordered the dish because I like wasabi noodles, but I believe the noodles in this dish just had a wasabi flavored sauce. Maybe I'm crazy, but it taste different to me when the noodles have wasabi in them. \n\nMy date ordered the pork chop, and wow! it was great. It was cooked perfect. Juicy and it had just enough fat around the meat and bone. The sauce was excellent, the only complain I have is it wasn't my main dish. I would not hesitate ordering the pork chop. \n\nOn a side note, if I can do it all over, I would've gotten the black cod dinner special. The guy next to us ordered it and it look great. \n\nin all, I thought the food was pretty awesome, service was good. Price was very reasonable for what you were getting.

They told us they had been told, etc., ad infinum, word of mouth advertising, about 'the house', and wanted us to join them. (Made the reservations 3 weeks early.) I forgot who invited who, so I called Angela and we spoke on the phone 3 times withing 30 minutes trying to figure it out. We figured it out, and thank you Angela for putting up with us.\n\nThe kicker was that the day before we had to cancel the reservation, Horror customer, right? (-:\n\nWe rescheduled for Saturday, October 16, 2011 7:00 p.m. \n\nBack to the horrid reviews. (Evil Grin). Lot's of the bad reviews complain about not getting instant seating like you would at McDonalds. Hey! It's a hip, trendy restaurant in the beating heart of North Beach, and within eyeshot of the Stinking Rose. (I've still got to get there.)\n\nWe arrived 15 minutes early and I checked in for the reservation. We were told there would be about a 15 minute wait. (Remember. EVERY table was already full and people were eating and more waiting.)\n\n(And it was so \"small\" inside) (-:\n\nWe stood outside the entrance. It was a beautiful night. As we waited for our friends, we listened to live music coming from the Saloon next door, across the alley. It was bright colorful, entertaining, AND everytime Angela came to the door to greet new customers, she always caught my eye with a reassuring nod to let me know she hadn't forgotten about us. We still, offically, weren't even in the door and I was having a great time. We were playing phone tag with our firends who were driving around looking for a parking spot. Did pretty good. They were only 5 minutes late, and we hadn't been seated, yet.\n\nIt's all street parking, so come 45 minutes early to make sure you can find a space. It costs $20.00 in some of the open lots, but it's well worth the convenience. Walk the neighborhood for a bit if you have the time. It's a great walk, even for just a few blocks.\n\nAt 7, we still hadn't been seated, but neither had anyone else, and we were having fun just schmoozing around. \n\nAbout 15 minutes later, Angela came to the door and called us. I think we got the best table in the restaurant. As you enter, left side, last table for 4 before the kitchen wall.\n\nAnd from there it began......and continued.......and Wow!\n\nThere were so many amazing offerings in the appetizers, we had to order 2 each, total 8, and a general one to share. We shared them all and each was better than the one before. It didn't matter what we ordered.\n\nDon't let me start on the presentations. You've got to see them for yourself.\n\nThe table next to us had their main courses serverd just as we were ordering. We didn't get a good shot at the menu. We just ordered what the table next to us had. (It doesn't matter what you order. You will never have had anything like it before.)\n\nDeserts were simple, traditional, for the most part (-: , and made of the finest quality ingredients that you could tase in every bite. \n\nThe wait staff was attentive, polite, helpful, fast (even more so that we had expected. Thats a good thing.), and were responsible for the throughly enjoyable time we had.\n\nThank you Angela, and your partner and your staff. It was really wonderful.\n\nGo. Don't be in a hurry. Enjoy a really rare dining experience.", "author": "Jeffrey C."}

The only unfortunate part was that they did not have their trademark black cod which I had heard so much about. Instead, I had the sea bass and the risotto. Both were succulent, flavorful and looked absolutely mouth-watering. The shrimp were moist and had a spiceful kick to it. The bass seemed to flow on the palette and was buttery and sweet.\n\nEating with a serious \"yelper\" who had highly recommended the place, I am pleased to say that I was definitely not dissapointed. \n\nTo finish off dinner, we had this artistically glazed COCONUT creme brulee.

In fact, I can get a little weary about any type of Asian food served in an environment a little too nice - I crave the hole in the wall where you have to wipe the top of your soda to ensure safety. I went against my better judgment when a few friends were in town on business and they agreed to expense my meal providing I would agree to come to The House. Needles to say, this place absolutely blew me away. The food was absolutely amazing. \n\nIt was the perfect experience from the start - everything on the menu sounds so mouthwatering you narrow it down to your top 5, discuss with your counterparts, figure out a way to have a taste of absolutely everything and feel set....until the waitress comes around with the specials and you plan is splattered. After a LOT of debate and contemplation, I ordered a black cod special and as the dishes came around to the table I realized everything on the menu really is amazing and anything ordered would not have disappointed. The appetizers were the perfect size - a flavorful teaser of more to come. And my mango desert was the perfect night topper. \n\nThe ambiance was priceless. The whole environment made me feel like someone pictured through a window enjoying wine and conversation among good company with a huge smile on my face and a feeling that life can be just amazing.

I think this has to be the best value around town for a very nice lunch.  Plenty of places could charge $4-8 more per dish, especially in north beach along columbus.  \nI rotate between the 3 noodle dishes, the wasabi noodles, the udon in broth, and the curry noodles.  Wasabi gets my vote most often, with the salmon.  But no companion has ever complained.\nUsually we go as a group of 6-8 from work, and it can become difficult to hear each other in the space which bounces a lot of sound around.  The interior is fairly sparse otherwise.  It has an austerity and efficiency that many 'Asian' restaurants try to imbue, but House has food worthy of focusing on.  \nService is smooth and helpful, managing large groups and bringing the food out hot.

We had the calamari, the salmon rolls, and the shrimp and pork dumplings.  Everything was prepared perfectly.  Even that fake salad garnish stuff was yummy.\n\nSurprisingly however the actual salads were terrible. One of my friends thought they may have forgotten the vinigrette on her chinese chicken salad because it lacked any flavor.  And even though my other friend's butter lettuce salad was drenched in dressing, it ALSO tasted rather bland.\n\nOn the flipside, those of us who had actual entrees weren't disappointed.  We especially enjoyed the tempura soft shell crab.  The curry noodles with grilled chicken was also tasty.  And if they offer the ribeye sandwich again (it was today's special only), get it.  The meat was extremely tender and tasty.\n\nOverall, I would still go back to the restaurant, if only to try more of the other dishes recommended by  the other Yelp reviewers.  Hell, I'd go back just for the appetizers.  \n\nThree stars however for this restaurant because it's hard to mess up a salad and yet they did.", "author": "Angela K."}

The 575 Yelpers and 4.5 stars won't lie to you. \n\nI tried their black cod special with california roll. The fish literally melts in your mouth and the smooth teriyaki/soy sauce is a terrific pairing to the fish. The california roll was presented beautifully and very fresh. (Actually, it was more like a california strip. Instead of those little short rolls you typically get at sushi restaurants, the House made them into long strips filled with the same ingredients. Very unique.) I am, however, taking away 1 star because the sauce got waaaay too salty after awhile. Perhaps some noodles and rice on the side would've helped. (God, I'm so Asian!) The sea bass is also very delicious. \n\nService was decent and attentive.\n\nDecor - simple, and casual. Not incredibly romantic, but it would be a great hangout for friends/family. \n\nThis is a tiny restaurant in the North Beach area - so be sure to make reservations.

When we stepped foot into the restaurant it was packed, just as I had expected.  The staff was unwelcoming; I had to go to the waitress to tell her we had reservations, and was then finally seated.\nThe waitress was pushing us to get the specials of the day, but because we had looked on yelp on the recommended dishes, we were set on what we wanted.  She seemed upset when we didn't take her recommendations. My fianc\u00e9 got the wasabi noodles..and he wanted it with beef but they didn't have it as an option, it was either salmon or pork.  He chose the pork and I got the sea bass.\nWe waited for over half an hour for our food, which I was fine about because how busy it was.  The waitress was unfriendly and gave me warm water, I asked politely if she may put some ice, and she seemed pissed that I asked.\nMy fianc\u00e9's pork was very thin and dry, and my initial bite on the sea bass was dry as well.. but once I got to the center of the fish it was moist. The noodles that we both got was GREASY!..It seemed like it was drenched in oil to give a shine look, although the texture and flavor of the noodles was good.\nOverall service was bad..food was mediocre.

I had no idea where we were going or what to expect as we walked our towards North Beach, quite possibly one of my favorite districts of San Francisco. Past the Church of Scientology, past City Lights.\n\nEnter THE HOUSE: a quaint little place, modern and yet with an old charm.  Maybe not spacious enough for big groups, but perfect for a date, or, as the girl sitting at the table next to us silently suggested with her Sherman Alexie novel in hand, a peaceful lunch.\n\nI became nervous when I realized this was an Asian fusion place. I had never been to an Asian fusion place that I liked. Their aim for ambiance and strong flavor never seem to make up for bad taste and price, but The House definitely made me shut-the-fuck-up-and-eat.\n\nCalamari, well, it's hard to fuck up on fried calimari.  The bean tempura with some kind of special soy sauce was something incredibly unique, light in texture but strong in taste.  I tried the sea bass main course as well, cooked to perfection.\n\nBut I think I probably died when I had the flatiron steak.  It was presented beautifully and was absolutely delicious. Even the decorative shredded carrots at the top were good, and had a lovely \"fried Asian\" flavor. Yeah, I did die actually. \n\nThe mango tapioca was hmm, maybe not enough mango, but still delicious in flavor and tasted like a much creamier, much richer desert that I might get at a HK cafe.  \n\nService was really meh, but not a big deal. Homegirl was hella rushing us, not that there weren't any free tables that Friday afternoon.  She was like BAM, here's your menu, BAM I'm back.  \n\nAt one point the ever pungent smell of marijuana enveloped our table. My head shot up, and like a dog, I sniffed the air to find the source.

I had asked one of my co-workers originally from SF about a good place to have dinner.  Without any hesitation he exclaimed \"The House.\"  He warned me though that I should make a reservation at least a week in advance because the restaurant is quite small and very popular.  I had called and made my reservation at 7:30.\n\nWhen we arrived the hostess greeted us and told us that we had to wait even with a reservation.  Unfortunately the restaurant was so small that there wasn't enough space to wait.  My date and I ended up waiting outside for up to 30 minutes.  Things did not begin well and I was starting to regret listening to my co-worker and never heed his advice ever again.  Finally we were seated.  Our table was in the back, small two top.  The ambience reminded me of being back in New York City, where all the tables are crowded together.  Our waitress came by and presented the dinner specials.  The soft crab tempura appetizer jumped out immediately at us and we ordered that off the specials.  My date ordered the \"flat iron steak with wasabi noodles\" and i, \"Berkshire pork chop in black currant sauce.\"  Our crab appetizer arrived and it looked amazing.  Actually at first it looked quite daunting as my date and I thought for a moment on how to approach eating this dish.  It came with a small dipping sauce consisting of cilantro, vinegar, chile pepper and fish sauce.  Reminded me a lot of the dipping sauce you get at a Vietnamese restaurant, except with a kick.  My date and I tore into the appetizer dipping the perfectly crispy crab into sweet, spicy and tangy sauce.  A very simple and straight forward dish executed perfectly.\n\nOur main courses arrived and to my surprise the portions were quite large especially for the price.  Both our dishes were under $20 each.  Piled high on top of a bed of udon noodles was perfectly charred medium rare flat iron steak.  Her dish came with a crisp slaw of carrots, cucumber and pickled ginger, dressed in a Korean spiced pepper dressing.  My thick cut pork chop garnished with chives and sesame seeds came served on a bed of smooth, creamy mashed potatoes and asparagus and lightly covered in a sauce of black currants.  Both dishes were visually stunning.  5 stars for plating.  A night that started off on the downside was quickly making a turn.  And what do you know? The food even tasted as good as it looked.  Steak with udon, just enough wasabi to give it that nice kick combined with acid and spice from the slaw made it a great complement to the steak.  The pork chop was cooked perfectly, moist and tender with just enough black currant sauce.  Sauce was also not too sweet, which is a plus.  \n\nWe were stuffed that we could not even order dessert.  The portions were so enormous, we had left overs for the next day.  Will I return? Yes!  It's a must whenever I go to SF.  5 stars for the food, affordability and originality.", "author": "Eddie T."}

You do the math.\n\nThis place deserves a 5 star rating. Great food, nice ambience, semi-decent service, but the food is good that nothing can really beat that. The place is small-ish (seats about 40 at best). I went here on a Friday night with a friend, and we had reservations for 9.30. They didn't seat us till about 10.15, and while I was a little irritated at first, after the food, I didn't care. So, bottom-line, make reservations, but don't expect them to honor it :)\n\nAs kind of a peace offering for making us wait, we got Salmon Roll appetizers on the house (non pun intended). It was delish. I loved it. We also got the lobster tail appetizer, which was a special, and it was just awesomely awesome. It was so good. My mouth's watering as I think about it.\n\nI got the Grilled Sea Bass, which in all honesty, I could have had a lot more of, not because they didn't give me a large enough portion, but it was so damned good that I couldn't stop eating. My friend got seasme king salmon, which he said was phenomenal as well. And for dessert, I got the choclate something, and my friend got the mango tapioca something, and they were both awesome.\n\nBottom-line, make reservations, and go early. And enjoy.\n\nai\nPS: It was a friday night, and I was running late, and its almost impossible to catch a cab in the Marina (by where I live).

Kinda average food, but large portions, great plate presentation and spicy sauces.  \n\nThe atmosphere is ho-hum, with bad fake wood paneling, and very, very cramped.  You really feel like you're sitting on top of the table next to you.  Dont plan on having any un-overheard conversations.  The staff kept trying to take our plates away before we had finished our food, which was very annoying.  I guess they were concerned about small-table availability b/c there was a huge party of about 12 taking up most of the restaurant space.\n\nAnyway, the best dish by far was the deep-fried salmon roll with Chinese hot mustard--truly an excellent dish.  The asparagus with roasted sesame dressing was a little too sweet.  And the white shrimp and Chinese chive dumplings were kind of bland, so we dipped them in the hot mustard, which cured that problem really quickly.  For an entree, my friend and I split the the warm wasabi house noodles with the sesame soy glazed salmon (they let us substitute salmon for the angus flatiron steak that the dish normally comes with).  The salmon glaze was very tasty, although the salmon was a bit overcooked for me.  My friend, on the other hand, likes her salmon to be more on the cooked side, so she didnt have a problem with it.\n\nWe didnt try any desserts b/c we were stuffed.  But we did have a glass each of muscat and tawny port, which were good.  \n\nWould probably come back, but would request a table by the window.

Although the tartare was lackluster, the mahi mahi featured exciting and explosive flavors. Others at my table ordered the miso cod special, which came with a crab-avocado maki roll cut lengthwise and stretched over the top of the cod in what must be one of the most interesting plates I've ever seen. They certainly know how to cook and plate here.\n\nUnfortunately, they could learn a bit on how to manage the restaurant's flow. The place is small, and there isn't much of an indoors waiting area, which means that those who are itching for dinner end up spilling into the dining room. Near the end of our meal, good food led to animated conversation at our table (as good food tends to do); unfortunately, it seemed as if the bus boys, the waitress, and the hostess were colluding to have us kicked out as they constantly pestered us about eating faster, to the extent that it soured the dining experience.

EVER.\n\nOur party of 4 was luckily seated within 30 minutes. Luckily because everyone coming in had reservations and the people already eating were enjoying themselves so much, they were taking their sweet time (people taking way too long to eat while others are waiting is one of my pet peeves, but I can understand why they were doing that here). So, moral of this paragraph, make reservations.\n\nThe food itself is AMAZING. I think we literally, cleaned EVERY single thing they stuck in front of us (well maybe except the garnish). Started with the mussels... DELICIOUS. After we finished the mussels, my friend's folks spooned the sauce up and ate it too. I don't blame them, that shit was good. We also had the special soft shell crab. It was very good, but simply pales in comparison to the mains. For the mains, we had the steak and the mushroom risotto thing that was on the menu, along with the pork shoulder and miso cod special. Each of those mains merits its own post-sex cigarette. MMMMMM.... I had the miso cod that was topped with a California roll. It was innovative, tasted great, and priced just right. As for the dessert, we had the mango tapioca (Damn that was good...), and the chocolate truffle cake thingy (good, but mango tapioca surpassed it).\n\nOh and the prices aren't that expensive. For the area, and the quality of food you get, I thought it was great. Our 2 appetizers, 4 mains, 2 desserts, my wine, an Arnold Palmer, a lemonade, tax and tip came out to be 175. I've had meals 5 times that price, but no where near as satisfied with my meal.\n\nParking sucked, but theres a cheap garage up by Vallejo street thats pretty cheap for SF standards.\n\nSF has a reputation for being a food lover's city, and I think The House is a PERFECT example of a place to go if you love food.", "author": "Rocky K."}

You could honestly order just about anything on the menu and be extremely satisfied. Highly recommend The House on the basis of the food itself. As everyone knows (and these reviews warned me), the restaurant is very, very small and cramped. Do not expect to be able to have an intimate conversation with your date here (but hey, as long as you're fine with the couple next to you hearing all about your personal life, you should be good). That being said, it was a small price to pay for the amazing meal we had here. \n\nThe food was that good. My only other complaint is that I was seated at the table closest to the door, so every time someone walked in or out I a) got a nice cold breeze and b) people were constantly bumping into my chair as they made their way past me. Oh well, my girlfriend and I got a few laughs out of it, as it happened pretty much without fail. So, is this a great place to bring a first date? Ehh, probably not (although for the food alone, it is). But if you've been dating someone for a few months now, are comfortable with each other and looking for a great meal, this is the spot.

We agree with other people who've written reviews for this place, the food is superb.  Very nice flavors that work well together.  I would have given it a 5 star, except that the service tonight was quite disappointing.  :-( \n\nFor appetizers, we ordered Asparagus with sesame dressing (loved the dressing), fried salmon roll (beware of the chinese mustard sauce, very hot!), and tuna tartar (just ok, probably won't order that again though).\n\nFor entrees, Hubby had a ribeye steak and I had the pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce.  I loved my pork chop (huge portion) and thought that the sauce complimented the meat very well.  I also had a bite of hubby's steak and thought that it was quite nice, though flavor was a bit simpler.  \n\nOnly complain about the menu is the lack of variety on the desserts.  We ended up ordering the coconut creme brulee with passion fruit puree.  In my opinion, the concept of the dish is quite nice, contrasting the tartness of the passion fruit puree with the creme brulee.  The execution, though, was another story.  The sugar was over burnt at part of the creme brulee to the point that it was bitter!  :-(  \n\nBiggest downer of the night is the service.  I don't think (and certainly hope not) that the service we had tonight is normal, reason being that we actually witnessed a bit of a spat between 2 waiter/ess(s) regarding some issues.  After that, I think it all went downhill and I can actually feel the tension throughout the night (plus the restuarant was quite busy tonight), since we were quite close to the epicenter.  I don't think anyone was rude or anything, and we always have our waters filled and plates cleaned out.  However, I don't feel any bit of friendliness nor \"service\" as one would expect in the restaurant.  \n\nAll in all, I'd give The House the benefit of the doubt and visit again in the future to try out other dishes on the menu.

Excellent service, impeccable presentation, and instant gratification.\n\nWe sat down for dinner, and we ordered the Ahi tartare and crab cake for appetizers. Let's start with the positive: the crab cake was beautifully presented, astacknd tasted as good as it looked. Just the right mixture of batter and filling, the crab cake was good to the last morsel. However, I was not as impressed with the ahi tartare. Maybe I'm too much of a traditionalist, but the tartare failed to entice me. All I saw was a futile attempt to dress up leftover bits of sashimi. Nonetheless, I can't fault the excellent presentation, or the burst of flavor that lay at the bottom of the sashimi stack. The House did as well as they possibly could on the tartare.\n\nAs for entrees, we ordered sea bass and a current special, New York steak. Both dishes were amazing, with generous portions; the sea bass was grilled to perfection, melting in your mouth, and the garlic soy sauce complemented it perfectly. The delicate meat just crumbled when you took a bite, and the noodles help accentuate the flavor of the fish without overpowering it. The New York steak was an equally generous portion, truly the traditional steakhouse meal redefined from an Eastern angle. The strips of steak were succulent and tender beyond compare, even to many specialized steakhouses, and the seasoning added a layer of taste lacking in traditionally prepared steaks. Mashed potatoes and chinese vegetables rounded out the portion and made me feel like I just stepped in to the Asian version of Morton's. The plate left me wanting more and yet fully satisfied.\n\nExcellent service, excellent food, excellent ambience. We can't wait to come back to The House!", "author": "C D."}

The salmon roll was pretty good with the wasabi sauce.  \n\nOur main course came about 10 minutes later.

We came in on a Friday night about 8:30 with a reservation and still waited about 10 minutes for a table.  Plus, there is no waiting area (or it is a waiting area for midgets), so you are basically stuck drooling over everyone else's meals if you have to wait.\n\nYour table will likely be mere inches from your neighbors' so do us all a favor and clean up a bit.  We had no problems with this, but just a warning - not a lot of space in here!\n\nNow the good part... FOOOOOD!  We ordered a half bottle of sake and some Sapporos to start.  You can't get anything smaller than a half bottle of sake, so along with your elastic-waist pants I would recommend your best pair of drinking shoes.  Next up were the steamed mussels with shrimp broth.  I've never been much of a shellfish fan, but these are excellent mussels.  Salty broth and just enough mussels to split between two hungry people.  For mains I ordered the sesame soy glazed salmon and he got the flatiron steak with wasabi noodles (cooked rare!).  The food came out quickly as we devoured the mussels and was presented very beautifully; see everyone else's pictures above.  The salmon was perfectly floating atop a bed of bitter greens and the glaze added a nice crunch.  There was a ton of broth, but it was very tasty.  His steak was a huge serving and the wasabi noodles were just hot enough.  Overall, we definitely enjoyed ALL of the above.  Of course we got dessert - a coconut creme brulee with passionfruit puree on top.  IN. CRED. IBLE.  The brulee was so sweet and the puree so tart - it was totally a perfect match.

Thankfully I was with three other people and had plenty of opportunity to share.\n\nMy personal order:  Crab cakes, Sea bass, Strawberry upside down cake, oolong tea, pinot gris.\n\nNothing failed for me tonight.   The crab cakes (in no way can it be construed as \"cakes\") were delicious, if not a great \"shared plate\".   Sea bass was incredible.   Through \"grilling\" (seemed like it was broiled), it had great caramelized edges, almost similar to scallops.   The hearty portion of shanghai style noodles and green beans is a nice compliment.    Upside down cake was warm and delicious.\n\nOther items I sampled:\nWasabi noodles and flatiron steak - 3 stars\nDomestic kobe skirt steak (special) - 3.5 stars - The sauce didn't do it for me\nTeriyaki rib-eye - 4 stars - Great cut of beef and well seasoned\nTempura salmon app - 3.5 stars - Great \"clear your sinuses\" sauce\n\nI can see the menu getting stale after a while, but for a few special occasions this place is spot on.

Try fitting 6 people there along with a party of 12 trying to get out at the same time. It was poor design and I felt really bad for the couple that were sitting right next to the window trying to enjoy their meal and had to deal with people standing right next to their table with their butts facing their food. \n\nWe had the crab cakes and I tasted more celery than anything else. The presentation was pretty nice but I had better. I had the Flat-Iron steak and my date had the Sea Bass. My noodles were so salty that I downed like 2 glasses of water afterward. I gave up half way. The Sea Bass was nicely done but it was very salty on the top too. \n\nI agree with some of the other yelpers about the wait staff. They had no compassion and they just wanted to recite the special and get on with the day. The main wait staff lady had her hair all messed up that it looked like she just rolled out of bed. It wouldn't hurt to use a brush lady....\n\nI was really disappointed overall and maybe they just had an off night.", "author": "Annie C."}

Room is tight, people with babies, tables spaced a foot apart.  Waiters and Food Runners butts and arms in your face all night long.  My biggest irk had hit me upon seating.  Our table unfortunately, was rocking harder than our \"Rock Band\" game at home.  Don't these people check tables for movement?  Uncomfortable.  Almost like dining in an airplane.\n\nSpecials.  There were 7 that night.  So confusing that even the waitress couldn't remember them.  Now, I love it when servers announce specials, but this was ridiculous.  Every table that sat down had to go through the repetitive process of the announcement.  And with such tight quarters, you'll be hearing specials all night long.  Every single table was clueless on what was on the special.  I think they should've printed it on paper, and just announce one or two specials.  They already have the slip inserts on their menus.  A \"specials\" board would help too.  It would've save the customers a headache, and the waitress time and prevent mistakes from screwing up the specials; as she announced something that wasn't on the menu and a customer had ordered it.  Opps!\n\n\nThe Food \nThe food is tasty. The crab cakes however is not your typical crab cake.  Its more like a crab volcano that went into a deep fried jacuzzi. If you're the meaty type crab cake lover, you'll have to look else where; maybe down at the wharf.  Expect an almost like pureed consistency, with the bits of acidic crunch that dominate the chew.  The remoulade was quite tasty, especially with the black tobiko.  The grilled scallions were a nice addition, even though they were cold.\n\nThe Tempura Green Beans were also tasty.  However the dipping unit could've used some more depth and maybe stay uncovered, instead of being a hidden treasure through the mesh dome of green beans.\n\nThe delicate misoyaki black cod was cooked perfectly.  I, however believe that if a piece of beautiful fish is served with the skin on, it should be presented with the skin on top, crispy.  The veg and sauce worked great with the dish, but the flavor of the miso in the fish was lacking.  Maybe with the skin off and a longer marinade, then fish would have that penatrated miso flavor as the fish melts in your mouth.  The open faced California roll didn't belong in the dish.  The roll was sloppy, rice was mushy, and the Avocado pretty much took center stage.\n\nThe Chilean Sea Bass was an excellent dish.  As expected, the meaty charred flavor of the bass exuded its high oil content in the mouth with every chew.  There was no need for the sauce on the side as the fish itself was perfect alone. The chow udon was great and the string beans worked very well.  A great dish.\n\nI couldn't help but look over at the other tables sloppy nigiri.\n\nBottom line.  The food is good. It's tasty.  It's cooked perfectly and comes out at a good time.  I'm picky about my stuff, cause I know my food.  The service was ok, nothing thats gonna want to bring me back.  If you like eating pricey dishes with the cramped feeling of being sardines,  eavesdropping and making friends with your neighbors, this is your place.

Food, drinks, appetizers, decor, service, location = Fantastic! Located in North Beach hidden within grant ave in a neighborhood known as Little Italy in SF stands a small restaurant called \"The House\" yup..that's the name. There's probably around 20 seats inside the whole restaurant a clear indication as to why it's always packed. Dined here on a Tuesday evening with some friends that lived in SF, we started off with appetizers: tuna tartare w/ roasted nori chips (good but a bit bland) maine crab cake (amazing and flaky crab cakes) classic fried calamari (had like 5 small calamari pieces at most and not worth the price) and deep fried chicken liver (wasn't a fan). \n\nI ordered the warm wasabi noodles w/ angus flatiron steak and I was blown away by the quality and taste of the dish. The steak was cooked to perfection topped with what looked like kimchee, the noodles was a bit spicy but not over the top. It was so flavorful that I didn't want to tell anyone about it so I can have it all to myself. Selfish, I know but you'll understand once you've had it. I had a bite of the sea bass that my friend ordered and each morsel melted in your mouth. Everything on the menu was reasonably priced, each dish ranged from $17- $25 which made the whole experience much more enjoyable. Big props to the chef who I later found out was chinese but is a huge fan of japanese food so he wanted to infuse chinese, american and japanese food all together which is a great idea on his part. Did I mention that the presentation of each dish was incredible?? Each dish came out in an art form, it was like a painted canvas that he's expressed with food. Now I only wish there was a location in LA. If you're going on a hot day, make sure you ask for a table near the door because the place doesn't have AC.

I don't eat out all that much, so I generally like to try new places...unless I've discovered somewhere exceptional, and that's how I feel about The House!\nI've now eaten at The House enough times to have tried a large sampling of the options on the menu - and I have yet to get a dud. It's been consistently good. Actually, consistently amazing.\nFor the appetizers, I love the ahi tuna tartare with nori chips (however I think I actually like the grilled ahi tuna entree more and getting both during the same meal would be tuna overkill), the calamari and the blue lake bean tempura. Really interesting presentation on both the tuna tartare (check out their website) and the tempura (it's assembled like a log cabin)!\nEntrees wise, as mentioned I think the tuna tartare is A-rate. I also love the steak (don't you dare get it cooked any more than medium; I heard someone next to me order it \"well\" the other night and I wanted to climb over and smack him) and wasabi noodles as well as grilled sea bass and also the pork chop. Heck, it's all good!\nPrice wise I think for the amount (portions are pretty large) and quality of the good it's very reasonable. Entrees all run $17-$25.\nThe restaurant is pretty small, and twice I have gotten stuck at the table by the front door which is pretty drafty/crawling with people waiting to be seated - it's better to sit in the middle/back (but not too close to the restrooms) of the restaurant. While the wait is pretty long if you don't make a reservation, I was able to walk in on a Saturday night, put in my name, hang out at City Lights for 45 minutes, come back and get seated in about 5 more. Not too bad. But life probably would be easier with a reservation.\nThe House seems to do a booming business - so the food does come pretty quickly and I get the sense that they definitely want to move you out since the place is so damn small - but I have never felt uncomfortably rushed.\nNot great for larger parties since it's so small, but I have been to a birthday dinner with 8 and it managed to work out.\nAlso worth mentioning that I kind of hate North Beach, but I would gladly venture there any time for a meal at The House.

This place was so good that we had to visit twice over the course of our 4 day vacation. For dinner, the Mister and I shared the salmon roll for our appetizer, which had salmon cooked medium wrapped up and deep fried with a mustard dipping sauce ($9). The Mister got the special entree for the night, which was a braised pork shoulder on a bed of orzo pasta with a hint of truffle oil ($28.) For me, I had the grilled sea bass with beans and garlic noodles ($26.) The fish was so flakey and moist, and the dipping sauce that comes with the fish goes perfectly well. For lunch, we ordered the green beans tempura as a starter, curried chicken noodles, and wasabi noodles with salmon for our entrees. All the dishes were very delicious and portions are generous. Prices are very reasonable for lunch, roughly $10-$12 a plate. For anyone living in SF or visiting SF, this place is a must try restaurant!", "author": "JK C."}

(and I thought all the hyped up Yelp reviews would ruin my experience for me but it didn't! It lived up to its 5 stars!)\n\nThe food was yummy! We had the Ahi Tuna Tartare with Roasted Nori Chips, and Roasted Unagi with Avocado Sushi Rice for appetizers. Both were delicious!! The Ahi Tuna Tartare had an abundant amount of tuna, and the perfect amount of wasabi embedded into the tuna mix to provide a good kick! And the eel, let me start off by saying I am not a fan of unagi, tho I will eat it occasionally. And the roasted eel here was muy delicioso! It was nicely roasted and without the fishy taste. I would order both of these appetizers again! And for our main course, we ordered the Pomegranate Pork Chop, and it was good... but somehow, we expected better. Probably cuz all the Yelp reviews raved about this dish so much that we found it was a little less than stellar. But judging from how we cleaned up all the dishes... yes, every little piece of pomegranate I had left ended up nicely in my tummy, maybe this dish was pretty darn good! haha And the presentation of all the dishes we had were wonderful as well!\n\nThis place has successfully managed to become a place I will revisit again! A lot of times I go into restaurants that have good food but the fancy environment makes it a bit stuffy or pretentious, so I don't usually return, unless the food was so excellent that I just had to (which is rare). Or some place that has good food but the ambiance is definitely too casual or lacking. But this place immediately puts me at ease and hits the spot! It is small, dim, intimate, and just the right ambiance between chic and casual. And I honestly think we had the best seats in the house (pun not intended)! We had the window seats which provided a nice view of people walking around the streets, The Stinking Rose right across from us, and the gelato place just down the street. This is exactly the type of atmosphere I'd envision eating in SF to be. There was a slight draft from sitting where we were since it's so close to the door, but it's nothing a glass of red wine can't take care of.

But after trying many dishes - my overall feeling is that this places uses way to much soy sauce. \n\nSo we tried:\nTuna tartare - the fish didn't taste fresh, it was just bland.\nFried chicken liver salad - the chicken was over-fried and dry.\nCrabcakes - this was great, lots of crab meat and mayonnaise inside.\nFlank Steak with wassabi noodles - the beef had no flavor, it was quite shocking. I really could only taste the flavor or soy sauce. \nBraised Beef Short Ribs - this beef was realy fatty, so there was some flavor in it. But I couldn't tell the difference between these 2 beef dishes. They essentially have the same flavorings.\nThe Seabass: again, it had a good caramelization of soy sauce but not really sure what else I'm supposed to taste. \n\nMost disappointing of all, the dishes were all accompanied with egg noodles, tossed in hot soy sauce and oil. \n\nFinally, we tried the mango dessert (way too sweet, tastes like custard and syrup mixed with tapioca and topped with mango syrup) and the chocolate truffle cake was good, very dense and topped with coffee icecream. \n\nNot sure I will go back.", "author": "Emily L."}

I needed a recommendation for dinner. Got a lot of varied suggestions from local friends, but one that almost everyone threw into the mix was The House. Took the advice of getting a reservation from fellow YELPERS and that paid off big time! We walked right in and sat down, while the crowd at the door mingled and struggled to find room to stand. i.e; a couple that walked in with us that didn't have reservations was sat around the time we had our after dinner coffee...\n\nThe service was pretty matter of fact and on the rushed side. I get that it's busy and there is a bunch of people waiting to eat.... but a little smile wouldn't hurt either. Our server was to the point and efficient, no muss no fuss. The place is crowded and it's loud as other reviews mention.  \n\nWe had a Lobster appetizer special, which it was very good. It was battered and fried sweet lobster tail meat with greens. We also had the green bean tempura appetizer, with what seemed to be a reduced ginger soy.. The sauce was very sweet, and only when I found some chilies in bottom of the sauce did the flavors really pop. I would have added minced chilies to the sauce or batter, was just too sweet and too one-dimensional.  My wife had the Albacore special, it was cooked perfectly. The Crab roll that came with the albacore needed a sauce, it was bland, and it took a while to find one on the plate that seemed to be paired for that....  The sauces for it and the accompaniments were muddled, if you managed to find the right one it worked, but for a dinner in this setting, guessing isn't that much fun. I ordered the much talked about Sea Bass, and it lived up to it's billing. I did not use the sauce but a few times, it was again sweet. The bass was done so perfectly, it needed nothing else. I will add the noodle accompaniment set me off though. It was sweet and one dimensional. I just felt like it needed a tweak and it would get my 5.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-01-25", "description": "I came here in a group of four for a family-style dinner. We ordered the following, ranked from the most- to least-favorite based on a group consensus (items not on menu are marked \"special\"):\n\nAppetizers ($6-8 each):\n1) *special* Grilled scallops - Wonderful consistency and seasoning. The scallops themselves were lightly-seared with a semi-raw center, herb-crusted, topped with micro greens, and complimented with a light sauce I no longer remember. \n2) Steamed mussels - I'm generally not a fan of mussels, since I think oysters have a more interesting consistency and clams have a less pungent iodine odor. Here, they managed to cook them to a soft perfection, and the abundant broth that comes with the order totally masks their innate fishiness. Honestly, it's like mussels reinvented to capitalize on their light texture, with a novel taste added to boot. The dish was also very well portioned. \n3) Deep-fried salmon roll - I was surprised to find that the salmon was intact rather than ground. The \"crab legs\" presentation was very creative and helps make this dish into fun finger food. The sweet mustard-soy sauce dip was intense and energizing. Still, I felt that this appetizer was the least special. The concept is fantastic, but the taste is just \"good\" in comparison.\n\nEntrees ($18-24 each)\n1) Pork Chop - this is one of those dishes that you can tell was just PERFECTED. Everything was just right here. The pomegranate-cranberry sauce tasted ridiculously smooth and complex. The flavor was almost indescribable - with opposite characteristics like fruitiness and smokiness blended together seamlessly. Combined with the perfectly-cooked pork chop, it was heaven. This dish was by far the best integration of flavors I have ever experienced.\n2) *special* Slow cooked pork butt - This dish almost ties the pork chop for number one, and I think if the chef tweaks with the sauce a bit, can potentially surpass it. I loved the addition of coagulated blood on top of the meat. The rich, fatty flavor was perfect when combined with the more stringy meat. The miso sauce was an excellent addition, but could have been less watery. The napa cabbage was soaked in the stuff and made the perfect veggie side for the meat. There was also a mild smokiness to it that I loved.\n3) Sea Bass - Extremely hyped-up and slightly disappointing, though still excellent. For those who've had good-quality steamed whole fish at Chinese restaurants before, the texture here won't be overly special. Still, this was the selling point. The meat was just flaky enough, and still held together well. The soy sauce dip could stand to be improved. It was essentially a strong teriyaki sauce, as pungent as it is straight from the grocery store. Both the ginger and the fish were overwhelmed by this. \n4) *special* Short Ribs - Korean-style, without the bone. At least this is what I remember hearing. The item appeared more like flatiron steak or another lean cut to me though. Taste and texture-wise, there was nothing to complain about. If you like korean marinade, you will love this: it has just the right amount of flavor and marinade essence, and the meat was perfectly-cooked. However, it doesn't have the flair and originality of the other dishes. At the end of the day, we all know what this one \"should\" taste like. The wasabi noodles were good, but the flavor was strong and so my instinct was to eat it separately, not with the meat.\n\nDessert ($5-8 each):\n1) Chocolate cake: a must have. This was by far the best among the sweets. The cake itself was extremely dense, with the right kind of chocolate richness - not too much sugar, just the right amount of bitterness and tang, and balanced between smooth and brittle. Hot damn. I love chocolate and this is as good as it gets. Fuck those expensive truffles. Nothing beats this cake.\n2) Mango tapioca: I was expecting a jello from the look of it, but it's actually a thick pudding. The mango flavor being subtle was a tremendous strength here, helping to bring the creaminess and barely-discernible texture of the tapioca out. The final effect is a taste that is both rich and light.\n3) Apple cobbler: My friend is a huge apple pie fan and was not too fond of this. I thought the cinnamon flavor and apple texture/sweetness was perfect. A lot of times, the syrup is too runny or sweet, and it was definitely not the case here. The crust was good, but not good enough. Like the chocolate cake, this came with an appropriate scoop of ice cream.\n4) Creme brulee: haha, shit! The passion fruit syrup poured on top was way overpowering. I'm sure it has its uses in its own right, but the intensity of the sweetness and sourness was way too much. The creme brulee itself was passable. \n\nWe ended up paying 57/person for 4 appetizers, 3 entrees, and 4 desserts, including some non-alcoholic drinks. Was it worth it? Absolutely. The House easily had some of the best food I've ever tasted, and like most here, I proudly stand behind my experience.", "author": "Eric H."}

Although he had to have the sea bass for which they are famous, I insisted on having specials, items which I had never before tried, just to see how they do with  variations.  Once again, I was totally delighted.  The hamachi carpaccio was unbelievable - the freshest possible fish with a \"salsa\" of avocado, shallots, and I have no idea what else.  I followed this with their special of halibut, created with a curry sauce and a sprinkling of the finest shreds of lightly fried sweet potato.  Outstanding.  In addition, the wine list is excellent, and (for a restaurant) decently priced.  I will continue to think of The House as my home away from home for great evenings out.\n  My guest and I wanted plenty of time to talk - 3 hours, in fact!  And we never felt rushed by anyone in the restaurant.  Bravo to The House for staying consistently great year after year.", "author": "Lisa A."}

We thought she was joking and  my friend proceeded to ask her what was good and she repeated that we now had less than 20 seconds to put in our order. Even if the kitchen or pastry chef was having a bad day, I don't think that a countdown was necessary to put on the patrons! The table next to us were tourists and were totally shocked ( we had been talking to them as they were also there for a special occasion) and needless to say, we all wanted to leave immediately. \nI have sympathy for the talented Chef and all the people in the kitchen that work so hard to create such incredible food but have the most horrible person out front.

Every time my parents come to visit SF we always eat here.  So Ive been a few times.  The space is small and I understand you may need to wait for a table especially for a party of 6.  Our reservation was for 830pm.  We arrived on time and 30 minutes later we were still standing outside in the rain waiting.  We asked the hostess with the crazy fucked up looking hair and she informed us they were waiting for a table in the back to leave. Those douche bags were jerking off for an hour.  I wanted to punch them all in the face.  When a small ass restaurant is bursting at the seems with people waiting to get in please have some common courtesy to get the fuck out and not sit around jerking it for an hour after you finish your dessert.  So anyways the douche bags finally get up and leave.  Around 910pm a party of 9 shows up late for their 9pm reservation.  They talk to the hostess and admit to her they are late and asked if it was ok.  They said yeah no problem.  When they clear the table and set everything up I was ready to be seated.  The hostess with the fucked up hair seated the party of 9 instead.  I understand you want to make more money by seating the larger party.  But we had a party of 6 that was on time and waiting to be seated since 830pm.  So instead of seating us and having the party of 9 wait a few fucking minutes they decide to fuck us over and wait until another area clears.  WTF?  The hostess with the fucked up hair apologized after I confronted her but thats just bad business ethics.  Yeah you seated a party of 9 and gained an extra 3 people.  But you also lost a party of 6 you fucks.  Do the math and you lost money that night.  Fuck this place.  I am never going back.  I don't give a fuck how good the food is.  Waste my fucking time.  The house can eat a bowl of shit.  \n\n\nOriginal review:\nThe House is a small house.  There is always a wait and you should make reservations.  My fat parents love this place because its next to Chinesetown.  Retarded.  I have been in the house 3 times now.  The first two times were awesome but the third time was so so because their menu and specials NEVER change.  The menu is decently sized but everytime I have gone they always offer the black cod and pork chop special.  If you have never been then definitely try the black cod.  Its very good.  The appetizers here are ok.  The main attractions are the entrees.  The crab caked appetizer is shaped like cock and balls.  Its suppose to be a volcano (I think) but it comes out extra long and round at the top sometimes.  I think the chef was trying to tell me something.  The salads are decent including the cesar and seared tuna.  For entrees the Seabass is a must order.  Its nicely grilled/broiled.  The marinated teriyaki steak was also pretty good.  I am not a teriyaki fan so I am biased.  I've sampled and had other dishes but I don't specifically remember them.  Therefore this review is part useless.  I do remember the desserts however.  DEFINITELY TRY the Mango Tapioca pudding.  This is my favorite dish at the House (besides the cock and balls).  I wish I could bathe in this stuff.  Mango ice cream was good.  The apple cobbler and blueberry bread pudding was decent.  I still devoured them all.   Definitely give the house a try.", "author": "Fatty A."}

But, those that were, eat every bit of this! \n\nGrilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy: This is super good! The sea bass was cooked to absolute perfection! \n\nAngus Ribeye steak with raw mushroom in a mushroom sauce: This was a special and it was Umm...Umm...Good! I loved it! Ten and a quarter stars!!! Whoo Hooo! \n\nPumpkin Pie: Now, this was the Coup De Gras of the entire meal. I had to pull the owner aside (who looks just like Vera Wang) to tell her that this was by far the BEST PUMPKIN PIE OF MY LIFE!!!! And I am 37 years old now...I have had a lot of pumpkin pie! \n\nCreme Brulee: Was brought out with a burning candle in it (for the birthday girl)! Yeah...Happy Birthday to Me! This was Excellent!

There is only 1 really bad table in the place...it's back by the kitchen and bathrooms. We were first sat at this table which was very disappointing because the servers kept carrying dirty dishes into the kitchen right by our table. When we asked to move, it was a completely different experience - much better lighting, atmosphere and ambience.  Now to the food...Impeccable presentation. The baked salmon roll appetizer is unforgettable. Also, I highly recommend trying one of the seafood/fish specials. I had the Ono and it was outstanding. My dad had the wasabi noodles with steak and that was outstanding as well. My mom loved the ahi tuna entree as well and all the desserts are out of this world too. Overall, the food is fantastic.

But this place has made me a believer of fusion. All dishes were impeccably prepared with every last detail thought out. \nFor appetizers, we got a grilled calamari with tomato aeoli and then a deep fried salmon that was wrapped in a seaweed sheet, deep fried, and layed on a bed of sour cabbage with a sweet wasabi sauce that was AMAZINg and totally to die for.\nFor entree:\nGrilled Sea Bass was amazingly cottony soft and juicy, grilled crunchy on the outside and just soft and melts-in-your-mouth tender on the inside. It sits on a side of ginger soy mixed udon noodles and some green beans. \nAhi Tuna (raw) was grilled on the outside but raw on the inside. It sits on a bed of rice and trio of sauces that tasted wasabi-ish but sweet and just yummy. The Tuna was so fresh and beautifully red.\n\nThey had some specials but if you don't get there quick enough they can be gone real quick if they're popular (I was drooling over the short ribs next table over) which is good I guess, because that means they keep their ingredients really fresh!\n\nOverall a wonderful experience that I would highly highly recommend to anyone visiting San Fran!", "author": "Carol L."}

We came, we ate, and we were conquered.\n\nThe House as it were, was smallish for a group of 7 that expanded into 9 but quite cozy, if we had one more person, I would have had to vacate to the bathroom or sat on my friend's husband's lap, which would have had me drawn and quartered or been my best birthday present...go figure...\n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the Maine Crab Cake with Pickled Ginger Remoulade (wow, it had spicy black roe), Caesar Salad with Crispy Bay Scallops (the scallops disappeared by the time it came to my end of the table...drat!), and the Classic Fried Calamari (the sauce was good!) All of which were nicely plated and quickly served! Excellent!\n\nFor main meals, we got: Sesame Soy Glazed Salmon In a Bonito Sake Broth  with spicy mustard greens topped with tobiko roe. I loved everything except the spicy mustard greens. After eating it day after day, that's the first I had to trade off with my friends dish...hello...I don't do leafy greens! The ever popular Grilled Sea Bass with Garlic Ginger Soy with mashed veggie potatoes and green beans...was like flakey butter! It was fierce! Steve R. had Warm Wasabi House Noodles with Angus Flatiron Steak...I couldn't mooch off him to taste so I can't comment, but apparently an empty plate says it all. Grilled Ahi Tuna (rare) with Spicy Mustard Aioli was Dan's choice and what a choice! It was perfectly prepared...not a fan of spice but he really dug the flavors. Joy P and Daphne had split on Dry-aged Black Angus Rib Eye Steak with Teriyaki Glaze, Roasted garlic butter with a side of seaweed topped white rice (sooo not Uncle Ben's)...if they could have licked the plate, it would be squeaky clean.\n\nFor dessert we had the gamut of Mango tapioca (not like the sweet confections of other Chinese restaurants...they had big balls of tapioca...and I love my big balls!!!), Sweet blueberry bread pudding with a side of vanilla ice cream (it was okay, not eye popping like the others), bittersweet chocolate cream cake (that was delicious), and apple pie a la mode with ice cream (it was sooo warm and gooey) and lastly a special that had peach crisps with a side of vanilla ice cream...that was the BOMB!\n\nService was exceptional and polite...even when we had the unexpected add ons of people, they were unfailingly eager to help. They switched out silverware for every course and gave us no grief when we had to order special sides for our picky eaters.\n\nParking is nowhere to be had, and if you are a parking Nazi then maybe you'll luck out, but go to the Vallejo parking garages for a stress free drop off. Believe me...you don't want to fight the nuts out here on a Saturday night.\n\nI will definitely be back to try the Niman Ranch Pork Chop with Pomegranate Currant Sauce...it was just too cute to be seen...dang it...why can't I have 4 stomachs like a cow? That way I can eat for days...", "author": "Pauline L."}

Not always offered, but when they do have it in their specials, it is a must try.  Another great appetizer item that is always on their menu is the blue lake tempura green beans. Delicious. Favorite entree choice: the black cod.  It is also offered as a special, but it comes prepared beautifully with a California roll on top. An entree that comes with its own appetizer? One please! The ahi tuna is always a solid choice as is the pork chop. The mushroom rice with shrimp would not be one of my favorites. Although the shrimp was excellent, the rice was lacking in flavor and had a bit too many mushrooms. But, to be fair, the menu did clearly list MUSHROOM rice with prawns.

It was a special occasion, so we had a reservation (which I recommend as this place does get packed since it's so small). The buser sat us at a 3 top, then they shoved us to the back area since we were only 2. Fair enough. We are greeted by a waitress, who struggled to name the specials. It was pretty painful to sit through and then we ordered the fried calamari & caesar salad with scallops to start. The fried calamari & salad were both amazing. The salad was a little overdressed, but I didn't mind since the dressing was almost like a miso-caesar salad so it was yummy. The scallops did resemble tater tots but they were crispy pieces of goodness. We ordered the grilled sea bass & rib eye for entrees. The grilled sea bass was buttery perfection. The garlic ginger soy was also very tasty. I enjoyed the udon noddles on the side too. The only two down points of the meal were the Angus ribeye steak & our waitress. The steak was so bad, that my boyfriend had to send it back. For one, you could barely cut it, I know ribeyes are marbled with fat, but this was ridiculous. We weren't asking for the most tender piece of meat (obviously) but to the point where you can't eat or cut it was unacceptable.\nWhen the waitress asked how the food was we said we couldn't eat the steak and so she took it begrudgingly took it back and we asked for the  rib special instead. We were happy that she took it back, but at this point she proceeded to ignore us the rest of the meal. Her nazi- militant attitude was a little abrasive, and if I were to go back I would definitely not want to be seated in her section. On a positive note, the ribs were delicious and I would certainly order them again. They were paired with a cole slaw that was very tasty. \nAll in all I had a pleasant experience at the House and I would certainly come back. I don't know that I'd crave the food on the daily, but if I had friends out of town visiting I would bring them here. I would also request to be seated with the non-militant waitress.", "author": "Kristy H."}

Obviously a super happening place, it was completely packed to the brim, seated diners and people waiting by the door. I always wince at the whole Asian or anything \"fusion\" trend but they had some interesting and innovative sounding dishes. I had one of the specials: sea bass in a curry sauce with mussels. The fish was tender, a huge portion (I definitely didn't finish it), the sauce was the most enjoyable part. It would've been lovely if it was served with a bit of rice. The mussels were quite good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-11-20", "description": "Another great find thanks to Yelp.  I wanted to save the House for a special occasion because I knew they must have something special if despite its size and the wait people continue to come and leave raving about the place.  I made dinner reservations for two on a Saturday at 7:00pm so I expected to wait around and actually eat at around 7:30-7:45...and I was correct.  We checked in with the hostess at around 6:55 and didn't get seated until 7:40.  This was pretty much anticipated, though.  Once a large group of 10 left, the rest of us at the door were seated rather promptly.  The hostess was very apologetic and personable and we were sat towards the back in a cozy table.  Our waitress could've been a *leeeeetle* bit friendlier but she gave us the specials of the night and gave us plenty of time to look over the menu.  We decided on the curried white shrimp wiht mango salad for appetizer, the flat iron steak and wasabi noodles for him, and grilled sea bass with garlic noodles for me.  The appetizer was very nicely presented and the flavors worked really well together but came with two shrimps.  The shrimps were succulent and done perfectly which is probably why I think it would've been better if they were a little more generous with it, esp if they were charging $9 for the salad.  I think I'll try another appetizer next time for variety and maybe better deal.  The bf's flat iron steak came perfect at medium and worked so well with the wasabi noodles, but it was a good thing that I got the sea bass because my noodles were a little better (no powerful taste of wasabi) and the sauce (sesame soy glaze) went well with both the fish and the steak.  The green beans, although simple, was a good complement to the fish and noodles.  Simply put, The House (and Dragonfly over in the Richmond district) is Asian fusion at its best.  Atmosphere was loud and lively and the place was indeed a little cramped but personally I didn't think it took away from the experience.  Our busboy, hostess, and the other waiter were all very friendly and suggested excellent dishes and specials for the night.  The table next to us seemed to not like their wine at all and our waitress gave them some lip about it being a matter of personal taste and preference.  But I thought she should've just brought out another wine instead....not a big deal.  We almost went somewhere else for dessert but I am SO glad we didnt because their apple crumb pie a la mode is just to die for.  But I did find a piece of hair wedged in it.....ughhh.... but since they were running out of the pie I didn't want them to bring out another one so I just braved it and ate the rest anyway.  I love you, the House, but that piece of hair and our less than personable waitress took a star away from you.  But good news is, I'm willing to go back very soon and give you another shot and maybe....just maybe I'll give you that last star : )\n\nAnd I wouldnt suggest coming here in a group larger than 6.", "author": "Peggy W."}

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS WINE! it made the dinner!! this place is hidden and parking is a bitch in a half.. also it is on a hill so if you are like me and are wearing 6 inch heels this can get tricky but it was worth the obstacles for the awesome food.. anyway im still dreaming of that sea bass and can not wait to return to this gem!!", "author": "Ashley M."}

I couldn't have asked for a better place to satisfy my hunger after sweating my butt off in cardio kick-boxing last night. I was surprised to see how  packed the place was on a Tuesday evening. Reservations are recommended! \n\nEvery dish not only tasted good but was visually presented well also.\n\nAppetizer: He ordered the Kobe beef salad special (medium rare per chef's order), which had a blend of greens, sauces and meat that was so tender it made our taste buds jump for joy. I had the Ahi tuna Tartar that was cupped by light crispy chips  (arranged in a star shape) and veggies and topped with caviar as a finishing touch. I looked like a ravaging animal as my fork kept going from my plate to his.  \n\nDinner: He ordered the grilled sea bass, which came with string beans, garlic noodles and a tasty dipping sauce. The sea bass was so light and fluffy it was grilled to perfection. I had the short ribs special, which came without the bone. It was the most delicious short ribs I've ever tasted in my life. It was crispy on the edges and the rest seemed to melt in  my mouth. I hope my waitress didn't think I was a cave woman as my mouth was so full and busy when she came to ask me if everything was alright that I couldn't even answer her.\n\nDessert: Apple pie Ala mode. The apples were so fresh (they bake it fresh every morning) and the pie crumbles had the perfect crumbly/slightly crispy texture. All this with the ice cream, I'm glad the bf got full before me so I had most of the dessert to myself. Or else I would have ordered another one. \n\nThe waitress was quick, prices weren't too shabby but most importantly the food was to die for. I'm definitely coming back!  As for parking, we parked in a garage around the corner. Ten dollars for the night.", "author": "Spicy T."}

They cut the roll almost vertically versus horizontally, and it was just different. I liked it.  The taste was really great too!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-04-09", "description": "I guess I just have trouble with trendy places. A 9pm reservation doesn't get you a table at 9pm. And I'm not talking about having to wait 5 minutes. They then give you about 3 minutes to look at the menu. The waitress stood next to our table until we made our decision. Then the food arrives way too quickly. I wonder if they know in advance what people will order, and start preparing it even before the order comes in. And, as other people here mentioned, it's way too packed. It's not like you're just listening in on the conversation next to you, you're almost a part of it.\n\nSuch a busy place, they must have amazing food. Wrong. OK, so most of it was very good, but some was terrible. So why do people come here? Why do they rave about the food on Yelp? Because it's trendy.\n\nAbout the food: some things really worked. For example the fried salmon roll. A piece of salmon, wrapped in sea weed, lightly battered, deep fried for a short time, the salmon being mostly rare inside. Comes with a carrot salad that's pretty good, but also with a sauce that's mostly soy, too salty and too strong, overwhelming the delicate salmon flavour. Other things were just plain wrong. My main course was sea bass, which had some caramelized sugar around it. It's good for a few bites, but then the sweetness and the fatness become annoying, and I didn't want to finish the last bit. This came with some noodles that were very good and some green beens that were not. The only good thing I can say about these green beens was that they weren't overcooked. But besides the fact that they used tasteless vegetables, I'm surprised that they would just plop a bunch of vegetables on a plate like that, not even trying to integrate it into the dish. It looked a lot like food at home. There's nothing wrong with that, but I expected so much more. Again, because of the trendiness.", "author": "Cris L."}

I've been coming here for as long as I can remember and what keeps bringing me back is their consistency in quality, service, and taste. \n\nI just dined here with girlfriends to celebrate my getting wiser, and I was again very pleased. We started with their appetizer special of (3) seared day boat scallops topped with daikon sprouts in a light & savory lemon sauce. It was perfectly flavored and crisp on the outside. Scallops I've had at other restaurants are usually no bigger than a Susan B Anthony dollar, but theirs was very generous in size and extremely fresh. \n\nAs for entrees, there is no way you can go wrong with anything on the menu. Several of us ordered their entree special of grilled Kobe rib eye over a bed of mash potatoes & Chinese broccoli in a chanterelle mushroom sauce, grilled ahi tuna with mustard aoili, and Neiman Ranch pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce. My personal favorite was the Kobe steak cooked medium-rare. The meat was perfectly marbled & tender and the flavors were orgasmic! It is hands down the best Kobe steak I've ever had- 10x better than Harris Steakhouse's Waygu Kobe! When the Ahi came out, we were awwing at the beautiful presentation of seared Ahi leaning on a tower of thinly cut strips of fried taro. With one taste, you could tell that it was of excellent sushi grade tuna. When our last entree Pork with Pom over a bed of mash & asparagus came out, the plate itself look like an art piece from the SF MOMA. Not only did it look good, it had perfect sweet & savory flavors. The faint tartness of the pomegranate and currants finished the dish off very well. \n\nFor dessert, I usually opt for their Apple Crumb Pie a la mode, but my BFF (Amy K.) surprised me with an amazing Coconut Cake with Buttercream frosting that she baked herself (House: She's taking orders if you interested ;). Our waitress was so kind to cut and serve the cake, and did not even charge a cake a cutting fee. I even had the entire restaurant singing Happy Birthday to me. It was just lots of good vibes throughout the whole dining experience. \n\nHouse has done it again by serving over-the-top food with stellar service that won't break the bank.

He got the Udon Noodle Soup with Grilled Chicken and Toasted Nori., while we got Warm Wasabi House Noodles, one with Grilled Pork, the other with Grilled Salmon. Everything came out great, perfectly spiced, cooked, and devoured. My salmon was a bit on the rare side which was awesome. I was enjoying my noodles so much I might not have heard a thing my boss said during lunch. (I hope he doesn't read this). But whatever, good service, good food, definitely will be back.", "author": "Alex C."}

Sure, the place has decent food but its way to expensive for the price. This place is small, by small I mean like its really small to the point that its hard to walk to the bathroom when the place is crowded. I had the infamous sea bass, even though the price is too much in my opinion the taste is pretty good. At first i didn't really like the combination of the crisp with the sauce but the flavour of the fish is pretty sweet. The service is prompt, the waitress seems to know what the menu is and i had a pretty good date here! Overall I was pretty satisfied. However, i wouldn't really recommend rating this place as a 5 because the food was just decent, not great...just decent. P.s: Wouldn't recommend this place for a large party, cause its gonna be pretty hard to walk inside with so many people in such a little place!", "author": "Cavin T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-07-27", "description": "If someone forced me to pick my favorite restaurant in SF,  I'd currently have to say The House. I wish I was loaded so I could eat here three times per week. At least now I live a couple miles away instead of a couple blocks, so it's not constantly taunting me. \r\n\r\nThe atmosphere is nice--just a clean, rather stark interior. (FYI: It can be a bit chilly if you're seated by the door due to the draft, but that's no reason to turn away the table if it's the only one available!). The service has always been friendly and astonishingly speedy every time I've been here. \r\n\r\nNow for the food. I always call it \"Asian Fusion Comfort Food\", but I don't even know if that's \"accurate.\" What is accurate, though, is this statement: Just. Fabulous. I'm so obsessed with two of the items on the menu--the Ahi Tuna (or is it Poke?) and the Warm Wasabi Noodles with Flat Iron Steak--that I've only ever tried one other thing once--the calamari (also oustanding, incidentally)...and that was only because the people I went with refused to eat raw fish. Get the poke...seriously. Mmm. I often split the poke and the noodles with a friend, and it's more than enough food (I can never finish the whole entree when I just get that). And always save room for deserts. I've tried many of them, and they're all delicious. My favorite is the fruit crisp special a la mode...they always have a crisp on the specials menu, usually with different kinds of fruit and ice cream each time. \r\n\r\nAs for the prices, well...they're not astronomical by any means. Certainly reasonable for the quality and quantity of food. But because I always have to get the app, entree, dessert and wine, it can add up. If you ever find yourself meandering around North Beach with a hankering for seriously tasty food, I'd recommend this place over any of the Italian joints in the 'hood.\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\nWent back a couple weeks ago (I never turn down and invitation to go, naturally). I actually tried something different (gasp!). They had a special steak and papaya salad that was just succulent. It was light yet completely full of flavor and had just enough oil to give it that palatable taste and texture that natural fats provide. But most amazing was the papaya. IMO, it's REALLY tough to get a good papaya, and I rarely eat it because it so often has that weird \"foot\" taste. I trusted The House to overcome this obstacle and they did. I also had the tuna tartare appetizer once again. This time the tuna was fattier than I like (I prefer mine EXTRA lean), but it still tasted great. For dessert we had the coconut creme brule with passionfruit sauce. The BF insisted he was way too full for dessert, so that I should order whatever I want, and then he proceded to eat half of it because it was so yummy. The passionfruit rather overpowered the coconut, but I love passionfruit so this didn't bother me, and the texture was perfect. If you still haven't beeen here, DO IT already! :)", "author": "Jasmine F."}

We started off with a watercrest and tempura salad and a piece of cooked unagi which was bathed in this incredible sause which I cannot begin to describe.  Main courses included delicious sea bass and a black cod miso that was simply amazing.  Service lacked a little warmth, but the food came out really fast, especially the appetizers.  That was pretty welcome because we were damn hungry.  It felt a little out of place to have this tiny asian fushion place in the middle of north beach, which is great because it makes you feel like you've discovered a hidden gem (even though the line out the door tells you the opposite).

I am usually not a fan of the squidders, but this was well worth it. We followed our app with our entrees. I ordered the Grilled Mahi and mussels (spicy and tender), while my friend order the Blackened Cod. Her meal was out of this world. We then finished off the meal with a couple desserts that we shared. We had the apple/blueberry cobbler and the creme brulee with the toasted crispy glaze.

They attempt to do \"Asian Fusion\", but it seems to me they simply turn out Asian dishes and try to pass them off as some sort of fusion cuisine. I went with a large group of friends and was able to sample many appetizers. They were all okay, but many of the rolls reminded me of Japanese restaurant food and I didn't come to this restaurant to get Japanese food, I came for Fusion. Their mussels were very fresh and soft, but had very little flavor infused into them. The best items on their menu are probably the fish items. I had a VERY moist and delicate fish dish. The quality of the fish and the way it was cooked was definitely 5 stars, but the rest of the dish accompanying the fish were so so. There was a terrible sauce which seemed like it was just squirted out of a teriyaki sauce bottle and the sushi roll topping the fish was out of place. The size of the restaurant bothered me as well. IT'S TINY!!! The staff was accomodating as we reduced the # in our party, then added one at the last minute during our meal. They need more space and I guess that's not something legitimate to complain about, but the cramped quarters bothered me. \n\nOverall, it was an okay experience. I wish this place were more \"Fusion\" than merely \"Attempts at Asian\". The chefs seem to have good technique when preparing the dishes, just the flavors seemed to not match as well as it could have.", "author": "Arick R."}

We all made it on time and the place was packed.  We had to wait 30 minutes for our table because the previous party wasn't leaving.  When we sat down, the waitress immediately told us that they were providing us a free appetizer for the wait.  We hadn't complained or anything to them prior to this offer but it certainly helped make the experience better.\n\nIn spite of the busyness, the service was top notch.  We definitely had enough attention on us and still had an ample amount of time to just sit and enjoy our dinners.\n\nOur free appetizer was the salmon rolls which were awesome.  It comes with a nice spicy mustard sauce to complement it.  We split two ahi tuna tartare with nori chips and a roasted eel roll.  The tartare was a little spicy (good for me but not for my fiancee) with wasabi.   The roasted eel roll was really good and I would order that again in the future.  It was fairly big too.  \n\nFor our entrees, I ordered the porkchop with pomegranate currant sauce.  My fiancee ordered the sea bass.  We both thoroughly loved our dishes.  The House does an extraordinary job of presenting the food and giving great portions.  My porkchop was so good that I almost licked the entire place clean.  There wasn't a trace of food left on it.  The same could be said for the sea bass.  \n\nWe paired our meal with a Malbec from Argentina.  \n\nThe entire experience was great and I will be back again.  It was really surprising to see how busy they were for a Tuesday.  People were still coming in at 10pm, although the place wasn't completely full.  It makes me wonder how busy they must be on a weekend.  \n\nMake reservations and enjoy!", "author": "Scott L."}

That dish was good, but lacking focused flavors. Our only complaint (which seems to be the running complaint) is the unfriendly hostess. I actually think \"unfriendly\" doesn't entirely do her justice. She seems... dispassionate? I didn't really take it personally. How can they make such inspired food with such sterile, frowny faces? When we arrived 5 minutes before our reservation, it took quite awhile to receive any acknowledgement.

When we arrived to the house, parking was hard but its san francisco, i should have already expected that. we parked a few blocks down in a lot that cost $15. When we stepped into the house, it was extremely tiny. The tables were so close to each other, it felt a little uncomfortable trying to have a romantic date with my man. We started off with glasses of wine to loosen up a bit, and it worked. We started dinner off with 2 appetizers; The deep fried salmon & oysters on the half shell. The deep fried salmon was no joke. it was so delicious! The wasabi sauce on the side had a little kick to it, which made the salmon more interesting. The oysters on the half shell were nothing special, but i still ate it all. =] For Entrees, I had the sea bass of course, and my man had the wasabi noodles with grilled flat iron steak on top. They were both extremely delicious. The sea bass was so soft and buttery, nobody on yelp was exaggerating about this stuff! The wasabi noodles were very delicious as well, almost reminded me of garlic noodles but a little more saltier. I high recommend anyone to try this place!! I also suggest you make reservations.

(special) i think it was 1 or 2 gigantic scallops covered with microgreens.  we all really liked it.  \n\n2. the salmon roll thingee. i thought it was delicious.\n\n3. sea bass + noodles.  my sea bass was soft and tender. the noodles were fine - i actually really don't like those kind of thick noodles, but the wine made it tasty.  minus the wine, this dish would have been good, but not that special.\n\n4. desserts. good. mango tapioca and a cake of some sort. \n\nthe prices are pretty reasonable. i'd come here again. the service was good. efficient, friendly enough but not ass kissing friendly.  \n\nparking is really bad, so i'll just tell you to save yourself the 45 minutes driving around trying to maneuver 1 way streets after which you still won't find parking. there's a parking garage nearby.  just pay to park there.  it's well worth it.", "author": "S O."}

The House has an awesome wine list of reasonably-priced but still yummy bottles.  We ordered a great pinot noir from Merry Edwards, but then they served it in glasses that were so hot, my first glass was killed.  If you're going to serve good wine that like, you need to pay attention to the temperature!  Secondly, my salad had so much dressing it was gross.  The flavor combinations were fantastic, but the lettuce was absolutely drowned.  It was sad.  I love butter lettuce, but this was like having dressing with a little lettuce.

The mango tapioca didn't taste much like mango... more of an almond flavor.  it was still very delicious w/ the sago on the bottom (my favorite).

The steak was tender and was slightly reminiscent of Korean bbq in the flavorings. The sea bass was just perfectly grilled and the soy sauce it was served with was full of flavor.

For a special occasion, with friends flying in from Denver, thought it would be a great place to celebrate two of their birthdays.  For a party of seven, a reservation is prudent.  Thus, I call, they say for a party of six or more the owner has to call me back.  I ask for a call back the same day, called before lunch time so figured it would be enough time for a response.  I get a call back the next day.  That's perfectly fine.  I'm told there's no table for the desired time, only 630pm and 930pm.  Since the earlier time wouldn't work, I said I'll take 930pm and will call back if I can't find a different reservation.  I was asked for a credit card to hold the table, if I fail to call and cancel, I will be charged $10pp.  This is fine and dandy but I had to chuckle and tell her no thanks.  Why?  The tone of her voice and the way \"Casey\" talked to me, I was treated like second class, like I was doing her a favor.  Isn't a restaurant part of the service industry?  Isn't it supposed to be welcoming?  The food is decent not anything to rave about, but thought my friends would enjoy it.  Too bad they will not.

We then had the pork chops with pomegranate sauce and black rock cod. The pork chop was absolutely fabulous. It was the best pork chop I have had. The pomegranate sauce was great with the pork chop as well as with the mashed potatoes (who would have known mash potatoes and pomegranate was a good combo). There was a slight hint of basil that worked well to keep the flavors of the sauce from being just a sweet sauce.  My wife had the black rock fish. Since they had a California roll on top, the sauce they used was like the sauce on unagi. It worked well with both the California roll and the black rock fish.\n\nService was good. It was a slow day due to the rain, so they took care of us. It is a great place. Driving to the area is a little awkward due to the fact that it is a small restaurant on an intersection that wont let you turn onto the street (we were driving from Van Ness Ave going down Broadway).

The menu has plenty of winners like the unagi on rice and ahi tuna appetizers.  It's been a while since my favorite dish the Hawaiian Butterfish was on the menu (but I think it's seasonal).  I always order to share and the sea bass is a must.  The steaks are also very good there.  Opal and the rest of the waitstaff are friendly and unpretentious.  The prices are reasonable for the quality of food and ambiance.  I almost always take out of towners here when they first visit and they're always impressed.  By far my favorite restaurant in SF because it does Asian Fusion the way it was meant to be.", "author": "Dave L."}

The House is this restaurant and #1 and #2 apply.\n\nI've been going here for over 7 years.  I was an \"asian fusion\" virgin coming here having no idea of what to expect.  I'm not Mr. PRO-ASIAN or cringe when I see interracial dating, so I had a open mind when my dishes came.  My first foreplay experience was the soft shell crab appetizer.  I nearly cried eating it.  In fact, I nearly cried just looking at it.  It had crisp fried noodles sticking out of it.  And they were like 3 feet long!  The crab was perfectly fried and the light delicate dipping sauce (not soy or ponzu, but something asian) was a perfect compliment.  The guts of the crab were so delicate, yet flavorful, that I almost shed a tear.  Then,  I had the fried salmon roll.  The wasabi dipping sauce had a nice kick and the salmon was rare on the inside.  Another tear almost shed.  Now, after the foreplay, I had my first time.  I seriously saw rays of sunlight coming down from the ceiling and shining on my dish.  Chilean Sea Bass.  I know, that was 7 years ago and they haven't served it in a long time.  But, please, let me continue.  Oh my god, my first bite was utter bliss.  Just dissolved in my mouth after 2 chews.  I was sad it took so few chews because the flavor was so vivid.  Flamebroiled flavor hits first, not like Burger King, but like cooking on a Japanese Hibachi.  Next hits the delicate chilean sea bass flavor that I can't explain, only hint at to people who know.  The noodles and green beans were so simple, yet perfect with my bass.  The dipping sauce went perfect (light soy sauce type) and that was it.  I was really sad afterwards.  Then, I had the cuddling.  It came in the form of Mango Tapioca Pudding.  It was such a powerful denouement to my perfect meal.  All I can say is get it for dessert.  It is awesome.  Best meal of my life, mostly because I remember it so perfectly.  I have had tastier and more lavish and more exciting, but you never forget your first time.  Trust me.", "author": "Terry L."}

I first tried the original location in the Inner Sunset more than 10 years ago, and thought they had the best fried calamari anywhere. I've never been to this North Beach location before, but am glad that the menu is as good as the original location. I came here with two others this time, and all the dishes were excellent. I like that they have a relatively small menu (with daily specials) that stays consistent in quality and presentation. This restaurant really shows off the best of California Fusion. And for those who are new to fusion cuisine, this should be the place to try it. I recommend getting the fish courses instead of the steaks. Also, order anything that says calamari (fried or not). Even though they take reservations, don't bother getting one. Just go there by 5pm before the crowd swarms this place around an hour after opening.", "author": "Jkj C."}

Made a reservation for a Friday night and were promptly seated at the appointed time.\n\nThe restaurant is relatively small and it was packed with customers.  The decor has a modern asian feel.  \n\nThe menu was mostly seafood.  Our party ordered the seared ahi tuna, wasabi noodles, and the grilled sea bass.  The food was excellent.  I had the sea bass and I was able to try some of the seared ahi.  The sea bass by itself had a great grilled flavor, but then I tried a bite dipped in the accompaning garlic ginger soy sauce.  From that point on I forgot about participating in the table conversation so I could focus all my attention on the meal in front of me.  I liked how the sauce was provided on the side.  It was a bit salty (which I love) but it was nice to allow me to decide how much of it to use.  The noodles and green beans that came with the dish was also excellent.  Nothing was over or undercooked.  The chef in the kitchen knew what he was doing.  I also tried the seared ahi and that too was excellent.  The cut of the fish was top-notch and the sauce had a great wasabi kick to it.  I definitely recommend this restaurant.", "author": "Stephen G."}

If you can cook Asian, you may be somewhat disappointed as the food does not come off any more unique than something you could stir fry or grill at home. However, if you can't make this at home - it's a great deal - sizeable portions, friendly atmosphere, not the best of service but not the worst, tasty seafood. My favorites were the Chilean Sea Bass and the special Hawaiian fish - big eye tuna sashimi and a grilled fish. My friend also ordered the wasabi noodles with a flat iron steak, but it wasn't that special and I could barely taste the wasabi. Oh and the Salmon rolls and salad with pork belly were delicious.\n\nSo unfortunately I can cook Asian food so this was a bit of a bummer for me. The wine was way overpriced and very untasty with my meal. I think this place could be a great place - but serves to please a different crowd.", "author": "Jeannette L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-03-14", "description": "the reason for the 5 star is the value.  this is quintessential Asian fusion and they get it right.  the papaya beef salad is phenom and I like that the dishes with heat have actual heat.  it's not Thai spicy but it has some kick which is nice.  The creme brulee is a little too sour for me but the rice pudding dessert is a revelation.  It reminded me of what I would eat as a kid but with a really nice grown up flavor.  You can't beat the price either.  Most expensive dish is $26.  The steak is really good.  Definitely come in a group of 4 if you can so you can try multiple dishes.  Any larger and it will be a challenge getting seating.  Come early. It could easily be a place that charges more and if it did, I'd give it 4 stars but for the value 5 star. \nWe had Ahi Tuna dinner, I had SwordFish special with coconut curry, wife had steak, other friend had another fish dish.

The reason I gave it only three stars is because the service was only okay. It took them forever to greet us. The waitress seemed a little out of it. Felt like we were being waited on my a robot. \nSecondly, they charge way too much for corkage! They were going to charge us $40 dollars for our chamgagne. They also didn't tell us that only two credit cards per bill were allowed. This was somewhat difficult for us because we were a party of ten. If this is there practice then they should inform the person who makes the reservation when they are booking a table. \nLastly, the place is too cramp. They practically seat you on top of other tables. While waiting for our table I watched them trap people into their seat by putting someone on the edge of a table thus blocking them from getting up. No one wants to dine uncomfortably.\n\nEven though the food is good, I won't be returning. That was an overall consensus from everyone in our group.

The owner personally greeted us, and apologized that she would have to seat us at a smaller table than where she would usually seat a party of 3.

Our resv. was early which was good because the place can get very crowded quickly. Tiny place but comfortable. \nTHE FOOD WAS OFF THE HOOK! \nOh damn....the deep fried salmon roll with hot chinese mustard appetizer. Whoa! savored every bite. Cooked perfectly. \nThat was a good sample of the quality of what was to come. \nOur waitress..... very helpful and explained more of the chefs specials. Damn. how does she remember all that? Impressive. Had a hard time choosing but I definitely wanted to try the Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy. The wife had the Sesame soy glazed himachi in a bonito sake broth. WOW! I had to eat slow just to enjoy all the flavor. \nAlways save room for desert... and again very impressed with our waitress who selected a perfect wine to pair with the red velvet cake.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-09-01", "description": "Went there tuesday night after reading the ton of reviews on here. Made a reservation for 7:30pm, the time at which my 3 friends and I showed up, but we weren't seated until 8pm. This was frustrating as we wanted a 6:30pm reservation to begin with and we were all very hungry, but the chef compensated by giving us a free appetizer upon finally seating us. This was the deep fried salmon roll which was pretty tasty. I don't eat fried things but the salmon I picked out from within it was darn good.\n\nI found their wines by the glass list to be fairly pricy. Perhaps this is in part due to the fact that I spent the last two weeks in Europe paying 2-3 euro per glass. Anyways, I ended up passing on the wine as none of the reds called out my name and the rest of the group all got beers. They have a very nice beer selection including Belgian and Czech beers which are both great. They also have an extensive tea list and many other beverages.\n\nI ended up ordering the Seared Ahi tuna dish with mashed potatoes and spinach with a wasabi sauce. The waitress mentioned that they can make it over rice if I prefer, but I thought the mash with the wasabi sauce would be pretty darn tasty. Unfortunately, I was served the dish over rice. This was still pretty tasty but I have a feeling the mash would have really made the meal. Because I was ravenous at this point and didn't want to wait for my food any further, I didn't bother letting our waitress know about the mistake. I'm sure they would have been happy to make the change though --- everyone was very pleasant. Oh yes, we also ordered the shrimp dumplings which were served steamed. They were good, but nothing to rave about as I've apparently forgot about them until now. Ooops. So back to my tuna dish...the wasabi sauce was great --- very much like the green goodness one puts on sushi. It made my nose tickle at the right moments without being painful. The spinach was well prepared and seemed fairly fresh. The rice was rice and the seared Ahi tuna was a bit bland to be honest. It was coated in some sort of spice rub before being seared but it tasted like plain old maguro. I'm not a big fan of red tuna, but I usually enjoy it with some kind of flavored crust when it is pan seared. SO, I think the sauce saved the dish for me and I would have definitely enjoyed it more with the mashed potatoes, but overall it was good. I don't think I would order it again however.\n\nMy boyfriend got the Australian Lamb shank special and it was pretty darn good. The lamb was very tender and served on a bed of heirloom tomato salad. He finished his dish and licked his fingers. Yum. My one friend ordered the Black Cod special and that was phenomenal. It was in a light miso (we thought) sauce served with asparagus and I think the mashed potatoes. I only tried the fish and it was perfectly prepared and very flavorful. My other friend ordered some kind of steak, which I didn't try, but it looked good and he devoured it whole. Finally, we ordered a dessert. I really wanted to try the chocolate cake but there was no other takers so we ended up with the Apple Crumble ala mode. It was fantabulous! I loved it and I don't normally like these sorts of things. The ice cream was very creamy and the apple crumble was not too sweet, not too tart. Just right.\n\nSo, will I be going back? Well, yes...but mainly for the chocolate cake and the crme brulee. I'd also like to try the pomegranate pork and see if they get that Black Cod dish back my friend had...it was awesome.", "author": "Kat J."}

I went there last night for my birthday after a day of drinking in North Beach and I don't know if it was the alcohol, but the food was delicious! Whenever I order the rack of lamb at restaurants, I usually get three tiny pieces with one square inch of meat on each. Not at the House! The rack was huge and juicy and they were complemented with a light mix of pickled zucchini. The tuna tartare was out of this world, but beware, the tuna is marinated in wasabi and has a serious kick. The mussels were amazing- I literally drank the leftover juice. Also, the kobe skirt steak special melts in your mouth and the fries were light, but had the perfect amount of grease.

We arrived 10 min before our 1:30pm reservation only to be told that we had to sit in the back next to the banging pots and pans in the kitchen and the crashing of dirty dinner plates.  Why did you give up our table when we weren't even late?  Our waitress seemed very terse and impatient to get our order in with hardly a smile. With the kitchen noise rather disturbing we asked if we could sit in some vacated spots but since our food just came in the waitress had to get our tables ready.  The food is good but really overpriced and if the service had been as pleasant to us as it was to the white folks, maybe we would have thought about returning next time we're in the city.

This place gets sooo packed that you might even wait 20 minutes even with reservation, but believe me it's worth the wait.\nMy husband & I are not wine drinkers but they have a wide selection of wines & they pair it with the food. My husband always drink Tsingtao & I always have the Jasmine Hot Tea. We always start with the Tuna Tartare and occasionally I order half shell oyster for myself (careful with the side sauce, it can be very spicy). For our entree you can never go wrong with a fish dish but our favorite would have to be the Grilled Sea Bass or the Sesame Soy Glazed Salmon. Occasionally they have the black cod with the california roll on top DELISH...You can never go wrong with a fish dish. Husband tried the steak and wasn't impressed and the mash potato was disgusting (boxed mash taste better). But then again don't go to an Asian Fusian place and order American Food.

The wait staff is impecable. They memorize their specials and they tend to all your needs but not to a point where they are huvering. I hardly ever asked for drink refills cuz they are on it. Even though the table is small they make sure they take your empty plate immediately. I notice the wait staff informs the cook when you're close to finishing your dish, which I appreciate very much.

As soon as my aunt heard that we were coming here, proceeds to speed to SF to have some with us, considering my aunt never wakes up before 12pm, this place must be really something.\nThe service appeared to be very attentive for other tables, but not for our table. I don't know if it was due to my ghetto Chinese grandmother being a little on the loud side, or maybe because my aunt is kind of loud too, but I could definitely detect a service discrepancy between our table and others. Not necessarily bad, but not as fast with our water refills etc. \nSince I am still in college my family believes I am always starving, so I tried practically everything on their lunch menu thanks to my family since everyone put nearly a quarter of their dish on my plate. The House wasabi noodles with grilled salmon was well-prepared. The salmon was perfectly cooked and was moist and flaky. The glaze was wonderful and the noodles were good too, but I think the chef was a bit heavy-handed on the sauce. The unagi sandwich was very good. The sweetness of the unagi with the creaminess of the avocado was great. The salad would have been good if it wasn't over-dressed causing the lettuce to appear limp. I also tried two of their specials, the miso-glazed black cod and the soft-shell crab sandwich. The miso-glazed black cod was again very well-cooked, very moist and served on a bed of vegetables and white rice. Again the glaze was a bit much since it was dripping all over the vegetables in somewhat of a puddle however it was delicious with the white rice. The soft-shell crab sandwich was good, but I prefer the unagi avocado sandwich. \nI was very disappointed in the lychee iced tea. It was literally one lychee from a can in an unsweetened tea. It had no lychee taste unless you literally fished the one lychee out and ate in which you would be left with just tea. I've had better lychee iced tea at a Tapioca Express.\nOverall, the food was very good, if a bit oversauced and salty at times.

I've been wanting to try this restaurant for awhile because I've heard such good things.  I went with a friend who I hadn't seen in awhile and we wanted to have a leisurely dinner to catch up.  The place is extremely small, so we had to whisper sometimes just so the table next to us didn't hear our entire conversation.    We ended up splitting both the halibut and the sea bass. Both were good, but the sea bass was amazing.  We ordered an appetizer and they didn't ask us if we were finished before they took the plate away.  When we finished the main course, the waitress brought us the desert menu and asked us probably 4 times if we wanted to order anything.  We felt extremely rushed like they were trying to turn over the tables as quickly as they could.  For how expensive this place is, I don't think it has the ambiance that goes along with it", "author": "Shawna H."}

The first thing i noticed when walking in was how tiny the place was. It was crowded, and it felt very cramped and claustrophobic. They also didn't really have a waiting area or chairs to sit in while you wait. You kinda just stand there and stare at people while they eat their food. Awkward.\n\nThe server was nice, but she seemed very busy. I also got seated in a wobbly chair (one of my pet peeves) but it being such a busy night, i didn't really have the option of switching tables.\n\nThe menu is short and sweet. They have a good selection of appetizers, entree`s, and specials. Their list of wines, teas, and other beverages were also pretty extensive.\n\nWe ended up ordering the fried calamari for our appetizer, and my girlfriend got the Halibut(one of the night's specials) while i ordered the sea bass.\n\nThe food came promptly, but i was severely disappointed in the calamari. I'm not even exaggerating when i say that the calamari was close to burnt. I felt like i made the wrong decision with the appetizer, but then again, a restaurant that charges the prices that this place does should make sure every single item on the menu, even the ones that aren't the most popular, are at least up to par. This calamari was not.\n\nMy entree, however, was very good. (4/5 stars) and i felt that it was perfectly cooked. The bass was tender, juicy, and had great flavor. I love the string beans that it came with, although the noodles that came with the dish was a little on the salty side. My girlfriend's Halibut tasted good, but she said it tasted a tad on the burnt side.\n\nOverall, especially with the horrible appetizer we were served, i don't think the food was worth the $63 (before tip) that we ended up spending. The space is crowded, small, and very noisy. I probably will not end up coming here especially with the endless selection of restaurants we have at our disposal here in the city.", "author": "Justin M."}

Okay, maybe it was the 2 bottles of wine we had with appetizers and dinner, but everything was delicious.  We split 3 apps, 3 main dishes, and 3 desserts. The only thing that I found mediocre was the pumpkin pie.  \nThe unagi appetizer, sea bass, and fried salmon rolls were as good as everyone else says.  We also had a hamachi sashimi special for an appetizer (simply amazing) and the butterfish entree special ---which I personally was even happier with than their famous sea bass.  Last but not least, the pork butt (yes, it really is called that).   It is as tender and juicy as any butt should be.  You didn't even need a knife to cut it, and it has a little slice of fois gras on top to make it even better.\nThe creme brulee was fabulous as well.  The chocolate cake was good too, but I still think the creme brulee was better. The coffee ice cream on top of the chocolate cake was good, but again --- it is just your standard coffee ice cream.  As stated before, the pumpkin pie was nothing special.    It wasn't really my selection, and the person who ordered it thought it was good.  I guess it just depends on what you are craving to some degree.\nOverall, I am a fan of nouveau asian, so I am biased towards this type of food.  Even so, I still think it was a great experience and will come back.  The only problem is getting there.  It is in North Beach, so no parking for miles around. Take a cab.", "author": "Christie F."}

It is so unassuming that, while being right smack dab in the middle of North beach, we have ignorantly  walked or driven past it on prior occasions. May be that's a good thing, reservations might be even tougher  if it announced itself like the other flashy mediocre italian places and strip clubs that abound North Beach. \n\nOnce you are in, the tables are closely packed with diners glancing over at other tables. Mostly in envy to catch glimpses of the magnificently plated dishes. It doesn't help that it is hard to chose from a menu where everything looks like its worth ordering. You almost wish you had dietary restrictions to make the choice easier.\n \nEverything we tried here was fabulous. The Sea Bass, if at all possible,   is better than the hype. The soft shell crab tempura special... divine. The flat iron steak with wasabi noodles ... excellent. The scallops appetizer ....also excellent. \n\nThe service is spot on. The prices are a steal for the quality and portions. The House most certainly deserves all the great reviews and accolades. The unpretentious but excellent food with great service in a simple yet elegant decor is  worth every penny. \n\nTo selfishly preserve future reservations for me- This review will self destruct in 5 seconds and your memory of it will be wiped for your own safety.", "author": "Arun R."}

I'm so completely utterly disappointed with the service here.  I walked in and was ignored for a bit by the hostess before she looked up and finally acknowledged me.  I was in a good mood, so I didn't hold it against her.  But then comes dinner where the waitress seemed a bit more than annoyed by me.  So much, in fact, that she decided to ignore our table during our meal, but made a point to check up on the table 2 inches away from us twice during their meal.  If you're going to give me crappy service, don't rub it in my face by giving other tables stellar service.  After finally asking for our check and putting in our card, we sat...and sat...and sat waiting for our bill to come back.  It was late at this point and there were probably 3 other tables in the place, so what's the hold up?  I watched as the table next to us received their bill and consistently better service from the same waitress.  We finally asked someone for our card back so we could sign and be on our way, but she looked somewhat confused.  We didn't even get half of an apology for being forgotten.  Oh, and almost forgot to mention the wine my friend had, which left her with a mouthful of unfilter crud.  Please decant your wine before serving.\n\nSo onto the food:\n\nSea bass with soba noodle and green beans - a tad bit too greasy (my lips had a nice oily sheen after I devoured the meal), but the flavors were on point.  Bass melted in your mouth, probably the best bass I've ever had.  Everything on this plate was delicious.\n\nMushroom and rice with shrimo: my friend loved hers, although I felt the shrimp were a bit overcooked and too salty, with too much of a charred smoky taste.  I didn't care too much for this dish.\n\nTuna Tartare: Simply put, I've had better.  Nothing really special.\n\nCrab cake:  Would've preferred more lumps of crab meat, it seemed overly mixed with mayo and other ingredients, so you can't really taste the crab meat.  Flavors were good, just not amazing.\n\nSalmon Rolls: effing amazing.  Salmon was buttery and delicious and cooked to perfection.  Didn't care too much for the salad it came on, but the rolls and dip made me very happy.\n\nKobe beef salad with crisped rice and papaya: not too flavorful, and desperately needed some acidity to cut the meat and the ripe papaya.\n\nI wanted to like you, House, I really did, but I don't like paying good money and made to feel unwelcome.", "author": "Sophie P."}

I was really excited about the deep fried salmon rolls, but they were kind of over-cooked (which i guess is necessary for it to keep its shape).  The mustard sauce was great... but I love all kinds of mustard.  My entree was just OK... it was one of their specials... Halibut in coconut curry with mussels. The fish was cooked nicely and I liked the tomato/potatos and especially corn in the curry.  But the other entrees (sea bass, pork chop) looked better.  Dessert was good.  Now while all the food was good, it wasn't awesome.  People were talking to each other at the restaurant orgasming about \"oh this is my favorite restaurant, this food is the best I've ever had, etc...\"... and the reviews say much of the same thing.

The tuna tartare and seabass both tasted fresh and was prepared just right... flaky and not overcooked.  \n\nThe service, on the other hand, was mediocre... my friend arrived before me & told the guy she had reservations, but he could not find her reservation in the book.  (but she did receive a confirmation call the day before to confirm the reservations)... How can that be, if someone from their restaurant called to confirm... STRANGE!  Luckily, there were a couple of tables opened, so he sat her down.  During the dinner, we felt a bit rushed, as the waitress kept asking if we were done with our meal, even though we were clearly still eating... fork in hand  & picking at the food... and when we were finally done with our meal, she brought us the check without asking if we wanted to look at the dessert menu (I LOVE desserts.. so YES, I wanted to look at the dessert menu)... so when we got our dessert, she brought out the check again.... I understand other ppl were waiting to be seated (we were seated for about an hour & 10 minutes)... but let us enjoy the food.. GEEZ! (dock a star & a half for so-so service)\n\nI give this place a 3.5 - 4 stars... the food is awesome; service is ok, maybe better if you can eat a 3 course meal in 45 minutes or less!  Also, make reservations & get the person's name if you can, just in case they can't find your reservations.", "author": "Cathy P."}

Cesar salad reminds me of fast food.  2 star\nUdon soup- came with rubbery fatty chicken. The bowl itself was a nice large portion, but it was awful spicy and chicken is not edible.

I thought the Wasabi Noodles was bland at first but as I kept eating it started to taste perfect with the steak!  I guess being fusion the dishes were a toned down version of the real thing, for example there was some kimchi on top of the noodles but it was was more like cabbage marinated in red pepper flakes, no fermentation and so it's not kimchi in my book.

If we didn't have a can of grapefruit soda spiked with Belvedere to warm us up, we might have gotten pneumonia.  10 minutes passed, and we were already walking back to the car before our host had the good sense to open the doors a few minutes early and shelter us from the elements.  The appetizers came surprisingly fast, and didn't seem to take much effort.  Don't order the chicken liver with mixed greens unless you want chicken liver with mixed greens, because that's exactly what you're going to get.  No bells & whistles here.  No dressing or seasoning either.  The tempura green beans were good because green beans are good right now.  But if it only costs them $1 to make, why are we paying $8?  The miso-glazed butterfish was ok but mine is better.  On the other hand, the wasabi house noodles with flatiron steak were an utter disappointment.  Horseradish and steak...it's gotta be good right?  That's what you would think.  You can't call them wasabi noodles if there's no hint of wasabi in them.  And they definitely did not salt what could have been a decent steak.  Here's a clue:  If a diner asks for a side of hot sauce, \"any kind\", and puts it all over everything, then you have a problem in the kitchen.  After all that, we were glad we took a gamble and gave the dessert menu a chance.  The passion fruit crme brulee, with its deliciously tangy custard perfectly caramelized all the way to the edges, left somewhat of a favorable impression.  What's the big deal about this place?

We ordered the White shrimp and chinese chive dumplings and Caesar salad with crispy scallops to start with. The Dumplings were really good. Our server warned us about the sauce being a little bit spicy, but when I tried it, all I tasted was chilli. I couldn't figure out what exactly the sauce tasted like. But the dumplings on its own were good.  The caesar salad with scallops were alright, nothing specatular. Then she ordered the Grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy - and the sea bass literally melts in your mouth like butter. So good! I ordered the Karubuto ranch pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce. The pork chop was cooked medium and was just the right amount of tenderness, and the sauce was pretty good. I didn't finish the pork chop because I had to save room for our two desserts: coconut creme brulee with passion fruit glaze and the mango tapioca. The coconut creme brulee was excellent  - but I didn't think the glaze complemented it that well. I enjoyed the creme brulee very much (I ate it all), but I could have done without the passion fruit glaze (it was tart and almost strangely sour). The mango tapioca was yummy, and Diana scarfed that down. We topped it all off with a pot of jasmine pearl tea.  We left the House pretty satisfied and very stuffed.

The restaurant itself it not large. Its long and narrow. It has nice decor. Our server was not great. As she was telling us the specials, she yelled across the table to a co-server teller her to leave the table. How about you excuse yourself to speak with her rather than yell at someone mid-sentence? We ordered appetizers (oysters - very good, crab cakes - mushy) and entrees (seabass - ok, I've had better at a chinese restaurant for weddings, salmon - friend didnt care for it, porkchop - good). From reputation, it didn't meet expectation. Maybe they were having an off night but it didn't make a good impression to get me back.", "author": "Master C."}

House has made me a believer, in that i should be more open, and i will no longer knock asian fusion restaurants.\n\ni've been here on a monday night for the special of the day, domestic kobe beef. i was a little hesitant, b/c it was \"domestic\", and i was in a snobby mood, so i was thinking, the kobe beef i had at the wynn at the sw steakhouse would completely shatter my meal of domestic kobe beef into lame slices of mere mediocrity, but i was pleasantly put in my place. i had my beef cooked medium rare, it came with stringy potato fries (super thin. kinda annoying to eat after a while, since they're so skinny and you just want to eat already, but you have to grab a handful so you can at least feel like you're eating something instead of potato toothpicks. it was succulent, juicy, tasty, mouthwatering, and you finish with a fairly satisfied appetite (i had the scallop appetizer before this) but being me, i was still itching for more. it was so delicious!  i would def come back here to either try a new dish, but why do that when your first time was such an experience, i'd def like to replay that again. its a shame that its only on certain nights. \n\ni also had the seared scallops as an appetizer. topped with sprouts. it was cooked just right. def NOT rubbery and overcooked, it was nicely seared but NOT charred. it was an interesting spin b/c it was the first time i've had scallops seasoned like you would a steak. it was like grill seasoning. very good. it wasn't overpowered by sauces or other bells and whistles. it was just plain good. fresh ingredients too. \n\ndecor - modern, low key, candlelit, good for pairs (dates) and groups up to 6 people or so, clean bathrooms. \n\nservice - excellent, unobtrusive, always there for refills, staff is easily accessible in case you have concerns or requests.\n\nparking sucks around this area (where does it not?), but its still worth it!\n\nlocation of the restaurant is nice b/c its close to a lot of shops and restaurants, so its nice to just walk around and take it in and chat w/ a companion, if you're waiting to be seating you can pop your head in next door to a cute clothing shop for women. i didn't think too much for the desserts, so i walked across the street and got some great tiramisu from some cafe in little italy!!! :)", "author": "Irene C."}

My uncle kept saying how it was a 4 or 5 star meal (and he doesn't even know about yelp!).  The funny thing about this place is that the menu downplays the elaborate plating and flavors of the food---It's beautiful and includes many different components.  My uncle's eyes were rolling back in his head as he tasted the scallop Caesar salad and cod with sushi.  I was incredibly impressed with the beautiful plating of the asparagus in sesame oil and sea bass with green beans and noodles.  The flavors really explode in your mouth and are incredibly complex.  I think this meal made my uncle finally decide to move to California!  Having been a pastry chef, I have to admit I was disappointed by the desserts.  I had a coconut creme brulee with passion fruit sauce poured directly on the bruleed top.  It just looked messy and the burnt sugar flavor (over-bruleed) and the intense passion fruit overwhelmed the coconut.  My uncle had a tasty but uninspired dense chocolate truffle tart.  The service was perfect and speedy.  Less ambiance here means lower prices and casual dining.  I'll definitely be back for the entrees but will grab dessert elsewhere.", "author": "Elena S."}

Chose this place for a different taste in North Beach. Friendly atmosphere with a tantalizing fusion menu.  True, its small and not much for ambience, but nonetheless a friendly placefor good conversation(crowded, but I can see why) . We shared two entrees--the seared raw ahi tuna and the promegranate pork chop. The ahi tuna was deliciously fresh, but I thought the (tangy mustard-based) sauce was too typical for this dish. The second plate was extraordinarily beautiful, in both presentation and taste. The promegranate sauce caramelized and poured heavenly over mashed potatoes and the chop, with the pork cooked to perfection and juicy inside. For dessert, we chose to split the coconut creme brulee. The portion was perfect for two, even as we contemplated about licking the remainder! It was really that good... I'd choose this restaurant just for the creme brulee.. mm .. heaven.

Luckily, my friend and I reserved a table early on a Friday evening and didn't have to wait long. For starters we ordered the deep-fried salmon roll with chinese hot mustard which was very tasty and pleasingly different from your traditional sushi rolls as well as the asparagus with roasted sesame dressing which almost melted in your mouth. It was difficult making a decision on the main entree; I was torn between the niman ranch pork chop with pomegranate currant sauce and the grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy. In the end, the waitress talked me into trying the angus ribeye steak with housemade teriyaki and toasted garlic butter. I made the right choice. I have never had a more heavenly dinner as I did at The House. Each forkful was bursting with flavor, creativity and complexity. I don't think there's anyone else out there who can pull off these dishes. Of course, I had to try their dessert as well and chose the persimmon bread pudding with ice cream. It was like eating spoonfuls of warm, gingerbread creme brulee drizzled with caramel sauce.

I went with my family, and the 5 of us had a great meal.  For appetizers, we ordered the mussels (they don't have bread, so make sure to get some rice for the delicious sauce), deep fried salmon rolls (with spicy wasabi mustard sauce, yum!!), and the special that day, shiitake mushroom soup with truffle oil.  The soup was spectacular, but all of the appetizers were very tasty.  For main dishes, we got curry noodles with chicken, unagi with avocado sandwich, chipotle BBQ pork loin sandwich, and udon noodle soup.  Again, everything was extremely tasty, standouts being the grilled chicken in the curry noodles, the breads of the sandwiches were buttered and grilled to perfection, and the soup with udon noodles was flavorful.

Our expectations therefore were inflated, and, while the food is good, it did not meet with our preinflated expectations. Began with appetizers of hamachi sashimi and unagi over rice.  Sushi grade hamachi with salad on top-nothing more.  The unagi is grilled nicely, but again these are dishes that should except at any reputable sushi restaurant or izakaya.  The entrees were their signature sea bass-tender and oily but not distinctive.  And the wasabi noodles with flatiron steak had a nice mild spice to it, but again nondescript.  Not really \"fusion\" but more like a nice Japanese izakaya, albeit with prices that reflect its trendy reputation.  All in all a pleasant meal, but not memorable and seemingly did not match its hype.  It is crowded and noisy, small, but that ads to its hip ambiance and,as other reviews keep stressing, it is nearly imperitive to make reservations, and nice that they do.

The service was excellent, which is always appreciated, but the food was kinda mediocre. We started with the crab cake, which had an interesting presentation (I forget exactly, but some kind of tower of crunchy stuff), and it was tasty, but, you know, very fried. Like, the kind of crab cake I could probably grab at a sports bar, but with better presentation. A lot of fried breading and a little bit of crab meat and some tartar sauce is always going to taste good, but I wasn't really that impressed. I got what I think was a butterfish in ginger soy broth (or miso broth?), and the boyfriend got the steak and wasabi noodles. I thought the broth that the fish was in was bland, bland, bland, although I think there were some tasty vegetables of some kind. The steak was cooked just right, which was a plus, but again, it just wasn't that special. The noodles were my favorite part, the right amount of spice for my taste,  but they were still pretty standard fare. It was a bit of a celebration, so we went for dessert, which we usually don't do, and let me tell you, the chocolate cake is incredibly boring. It tastes like brownie out of a box, and it's not even served warm!

The only thing was the CREME BRULE had a passion topping that threw it off. but other than that i wiped it off and scarfed the whole thing down.", "author": "JAMES R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-02-16", "description": "Okay, this review is biased as I used to work here. But I can honestly say that I crave the food here. The salmon rolls... salmon, perfectly crisp with the salmon still pink in the middle with a great  soy dipping sauce. His coleslaw is a fusion of different textures and layers of flavors, vinegar, ginger, spicy and sweet. A guilty pleasure of mine is the Chilean sea bass which is cooked perfectly , flaky, moist and the seasoning is yummy and is accompanied by a sweet ginger soy. The chef cleans and cuts the fish himself. Curry Noodles with grilled chicken is also one of my many favorites. The noodles are tender, the curry sauce is velvety with good heat and the chicken is grilled and seasoned with soy and other spices. The chef likes layering flavors and textures. Order Lamb chops, Pork chops, any sashimi on the special menu.  The food here is definitely a culinary experience not to be missed. Many have tried to take on his ideas...but I have yet to come across food as delicious and inventive as his. It gets very busy here...so I recommend reservations.", "author": "Chris O."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-08-05", "description": "There is one restaurant that throws out the checkered tablecloth of its famed neighbors and the over-done pandering to tourists and does something deliciously different. The House's small, gray, unassuming storefront is flanked by the blinking lights and crowded sidewalks of patio dining, causing most visitors to pass by without a second glance--much to the delight of locals who cram into this Asian Fusion haven nightly. \n\nThe House doesn't serve up much scene with their dishes--tiny dark wood tables and a decidedly minimalist philosophy in terms of decoration mark the small restaurant. But the food is all the ambiance The House needs. Dishes take on art form in sculptures that blend color, smell, taste, and even the looming sky scrapers and hills outside, making up for the uninspiring decor and small quarters. And once the perfectly cooked soy glazed salmon or unagi roll appetizer melts in your mouth, you're in for non-stop taste bud bliss that may dull your other senses or your ability to notice anything around you but the masterpiece on your plate, which perhaps points to the owner's design of white walls and crisp stainless steal counters. I would say it is a good place for a first date; just don't confuse the love affair between you and your meal with romantic feelings for your date. \n\nEast-meets-west comes alive with hearty main courses, such as Angus flatiron steak on a bed of wasabi noodles or grilled sea bass with garlic ginger soy. The mastermind behind such ingenuous pairings such as chipotle pepper and Chinese hoisin sauce or green tea ice cream with caramel sauce, is Executive Chef Larry Tse. Tse immigrated from Hong Kong at the age of five and grew up in San Francisco's famous China town where he worked at his uncle's restaurant and began brainstorming unusual ways to infuse the foods of San Francisco with the flavors of his home. He still gains inspiration from weekly trips to the China town marketplace. The result comes to life in the form of colorful sculptures on a plate that mix the sea food that the city by the bay is known for with a kick of wasabi or the crisp cleansing properties of ginger and soy. Even the unagi appetizer defies sushi's tendency to be too delicate and bite size to be filling. Instead tender slabs of roasted eel lie on a bed of sushi rice and fresh Californian avocado.\n \nZagat rated The House extremely high for its food and service, with an overall impressive rating of 26 out of 30. And it's no wonder why: when I asked if I could sort of combine two dishes I couldn't choose between by getting the soy glazed salmon in the miso soup instead of the bonito sake broth, the waiter responded with not only yes, but \"that sounds even better than the original.\" The salmon was cooked to perfection and blended deliciously with the spicy miso soup broth that combined the aspects of the traditional comforting recipe with a surprising spicy kick as the broth slid down the throat. Just as the sculptures typically start with a hearty base, such as mashed potatoes, noodles or a bed of greens, the taste climbs and opens up to unexpected flavors, as if timed perfectly. The first touch to the tongue is often not the last taste you will experience between the time the food rests on the tongue to the time it slides comfortably down to your stomach. Food as exciting as this calls for drinks that will not over power the nuances in every bite. The restaurant's knowlegable staff can help you navigate wine list, comprised predominantly of wines from local Napa and Sonoma Valley wineries.\n I must preface my gushing review of the Cr\u00e8me Brulee with my tendency to be a cr\u00e8me brulee snob. I can wax poetical about the perfect caramelized ice-skating rink that gives way to rich, creamy custard, but only if the high-maintenance dessert reaches my high standards. Savoring my favorite dessert becomes an experience of stopping all conversation so I can discernibly run my spoon along the top, testing its smoothness, and revel in the first crack into the custard. Then the first bite, with the perfect ratio of caramelized topping to cream--eyes closed, life paused in something akin to a spiritual reverie. While I'm usually a traditionalist when it comes to cr\u00e8me brulee, The House's island twist on the French dessert has converted me. Passion fruit puree is drizzled on to the golden brown topping so that at first crack, the pur\u00e9e seeps into the custard below and transports its lucky customer to an island vacation. The creamy custard, although not as thick as I prefer, has a whisper of coconut that adds lightness to the traditionally heavy cream.", "author": "Amy C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-04-21", "description": "By now, The House has amassed a loyal group of devotees who love fresh ingredients, impeccably prepared cuisine, and flavors that marry the best of East and West. My own personal favorites include the crab cake, which is perfectly seasoned with plenty of crab meat, as well as the seabass and pork chop. The seabass is marinated in a sweet and savory soy and, I presume, grilled, giving it a subtly smoky flavor. One of the highpoints on the menu is the pork chop. Thick but tender, this is the mother of all pork chops! Tasting vaguely of classic chinese char chiu pork, yet prepared using western techniques, it is a little taste of heaven. In short, the food here is exceptional and for the quality, a bargain. The service is also extremely efficient and no fuss. The interior of the restaurant is soft, subtle, very cozy, and always packed with adoring foodies. I could not ask for a better dining experience, and recommend all to visit or revisit it!", "author": "Yb W."}

After my several experiences here I must say that I hate Asian Fusion unless it is done right. I've eaten here on numerous occasions and I absolutely love the food here. I especially love the Sea Bass which offers a very exciting combination of flavor for the palate. It is both juicy and savory and the sauce adds just the right amount of zest. The noodles on the side offer a more subtle taste while cleaning the palate again for some more of that sea bass. I also have to say that I love the service here as well, something that you can't generally say about most Asian Restaurants(I'm Asian, so I would know). One particular instance happened a year ago when I had to make reservations for about 14 people. If you've eaten here you know that 14 people is a lot to put into the small space. I honestly thought it was a long shot and I placed the call for the request. The host stated that the owner would need to approve it. I already figured that I was going to get a no and so I was looking for another restaurant that would be more able to accommodate my group. Within about a week the owner called me, which was a shock. Angela, the owner asked me about my group and the occasion, and I stated that I was planning to propose to my girlfriend and I had our friends coming in from out of town to celebrate after. She told me that she could make it happen and approved it on the spot. To have the owner do that and help make that occasion happen was the best, because I really did want to have our dinner there. And it was a great night, one to remember. Awesome place, awesome food, and awesome people.", "author": "M L."}

This place is always packed due to its small confined space. We should have went somewhere else since I knew they were gonna try to rush us out for the next group. For appetizers we had the fried calamari and the crab cakes. The calamari, although tasty was over-fried and almost burnt. I found the crab cakes too moist since it was in the shape of a teepee. As for our entrees, the seabass, seared ahi tuna and cod were all very tasty. They have trained their mexican staff very well as the fish is perfect every time. Price was average but the three stars goes to the rushed service and not so good appetizers.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-02-17", "description": "I've eaten here before so my reservation on Valentine's Day came with high expectations.  Sadly I was very dissapointed.  The \"special\" menu left quite a bit to be desired.  We started out with the scallop appetizer and it was cooked very well and set a good opener for the night.  Or so I thought.  We had the kobe beef tartare which sounded good on paper but when it arrived it was mixed with some chile verde style stuff and placed on a buttered brioche.  It was decent but I would have liked to have been able to taste the kobe beef as it should have been the focal point of the dish.  Instead it's flavor was buried and i could not tell what kind of meat it was.  The next dish was pork belly and mushroom salad which was okay but they skimped on the pork belly and that was the main reason why I ordered it.  For entrees I chose the pork butt with fois gras in a miso broth and upon my suggestion my girl got the Hawaiian butterfish and mussels in a curry broth.  My pork butt was cooked beautifully but the odd topping of a morsel of cold fois gras was really out of place.  In addition the fois gras was seared but served to me cold.  I couldn't figure that one out.  The miso broth was way too salty and left me slamming my glass of wine with reckless abandon.  My girlfriends' butterfish was way overcooked and nothing reminiscent of the butterfish I ate in Oahu.  I felt bad for recommending it to her.  The curry broth had good flavor and the muscles were large but to have to entrees served in a broth on the same menu seemed like a culinary cop out.  When we saw the desserts we were crestfallen when there was no passion fruit creme brulee to be found.  Why would you remove that from the menu when everyone who has tasted it knows it is truly orgasmic and befitting on Valentine's Day?  We settled for the meyer lemon pot de creme and the persimon pudding cake catastrophe.  The lemon thing was so sour it made our faces cringe.  I HAVE NEVER HAD A DESSERT THAT TERRIBLE BEFORE.  Whoever made that didn't taste it and should be ashamed of themselves.  The persimmon cake pudding whatever tasted like a shitty spongy cross between pumpkin pie and gingerbread.  If I hadn't paid for them I would have left them to die alone.  Sadly, This menu was a total letdown and showed me the lack of range at this restaurant.  Whoever put this menu together didn't think this through and they should just stick to what they do best.  Bring back the old menu and leave it at that.", "author": "Jake S."}

The Salmon rolls lacked flavor but all the other scrumptious appetizers made up for it. Because its such a tiny place, I recommend it for small groups of 4 or less. If you like Asian Fusion food, House is a must.", "author": "F K."}

Dessert is not that great.  We usually head to Cafe Pucci down the street and have flan and tiramisu there.  It's a really small restaurant so make sure to make reservations.", "author": "Liz N."}

We had deep fried salmon roll for an appetizer and for mains Sea Bass (one of the best I've had in my life) and pork chop. Minus 1 star for the dessert - Creme Brule was just bad (tasting and the crust was burnt). Service was great. Can't wait to go back.", "author": "I W."}

Not many vegetarian choices for entrees though. We ordered two noodle dishes and they tasted very good. Those were the only two vegetarian entrees on the whole menu. I was disappointed because when I called to reserve they told they have lot of vegetarian choices. Its not a place for nice romantic dinner either as there is lot of noise.", "author": "mano e."}

I usually get one of the specials because they're always amazing and it's always different, but then one night I tried the sea bass that they have on the regular menu.  Oh my god, it is sooooo goood.  I get it almost every time now.  I've had wonderful foie gras on roasted pork butt, kobe beef in a Korean style stew, fresh halibut served with ahi and CA rolls, and it's always amazing.  The appetizers are wonderful too.  We always end up getting the oysters (served with a spicy cilantro mignonette) and the crab cake (one of the best crab cakes I've ever had).  Their desserts are also very good, but we're usually on our way to see a comedian at Cobb's so we usually skip out early, but when we do have time, it doesn't disappoint.  I've recommended this restaurant to everyone I know, and no one is ever disappointed.  They all thank me for telling them about this place.  It has a real cozy environment, and if Asian Fusion is your thing, you'll be blown away.  It definitely screams fine dining, but at a much more affordable price, and a much less pretentious setting.", "author": "James Y."}

The first of our party showed up at 8 (the rest were there by 8:30) - we were not seated until 9:45 - all along seeing other people getting seated...After arguing with the hostess on seating us, she crammed 9 of us  in the table that realistically seated 6 - and promised to take care of us.  Since it was nearing 10 pm and we have not even started dinner, we felt defeated and just wanted to eat...when the hostess brought our water, she leaned over and her hair completely dipped into a water glass (she kind of resembled Samara from \"The Ring\", black hair was all over her face and hanging down)....The waitress had a bit of an attitude too...We ordered our apps and actually got them pretty quickly, but dinner took a while.  when dinner came, my husband joked to say after us making a fuss to check your food for hair..well SURPRISE guess what he found...BLACK KINKY HAIR!!!!  The waitress quickly swapped his order, almost so fast, I'm sure someone had to wait for a new order and I had to make sure it wasn't the same plate....Next thing you know, i found a piece of hair on my plate!!!..I called the waitress over again and she proceeded to argue with me that it was not hair, but fuzz from the napkin...I pointed out impossible, as the napkin was WHITE and it was a piece of BLACK HAIR on my plate!!  I was so disgusted i could not get a replacement (personally I was afraid what type of manhandling they would do to it)...When the bill came, they charged us for my husband's meal that he had to send back and also charged us gratuity (which we refused to pay)...so where is it in there that they \"took care of us\" as the claimed - we got 12 wine glasses as opposed to 9 (because we ordered a bottle of white and red)...well that's just great....DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY TO COME TO THIS CRAP HOLE!!!!", "author": "Michelle H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-02-26", "description": "Ate here last night with a friend.  It's very small, cozy.  Detractions: thought that the house music was too loud for such a small place.  Service was pretty good.  We had to ask for our beers, which arrived after our appetizers and our server cleared a plate lightening fast without asking if we were done, which we weren't.   It was hard to pick out what we wanted because there were so many amazing looking dishes to choose from.  We started with a beautiful butter leaf lettuce salad with huge golden raisins, avacado, and blue cheese.  It was dressed perfectly.  Flavors were balanced and popped in your mouth.  I could have just eaten 3 plates of the salad and been very happy.  Next, we shared the white shrimp and chive dumplings, which were very tasty- shrimp was plump and flavorful.  Came with a lovely soy / vinegar dipping sauce.  I used very little of the sauce cause the dumplings were so tasty by themselves.  For main course my friend and I shared the seared ahi- 3 generous pieces that were cooked perfectly.  It came with a mustard cream sauce which was so different and delicious.   The presentation was stunning.  The fish was fresh and flavorful but had too much connective tissue.  We ordered the asparagus, which was fresh and very good.  They serve beer and wine only.  Lot's of nice offereings.  We ordered a red rice beer, which we loved.  I live in the Bay Area and eat a lot of Asian fusion.  This place is different.  Nice combinations of Calfornia fare and Chinese food.  Light but  very flavorful and satisfying.  For what you get the prices are reasonable.  I would defininitely go back.", "author": "Anastasia C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-01-19", "description": "I generally stay away from trendy North Beach restaurants (I enjoy the old school Italian NB restaurants)  but my girlfriend wanted to try this one out due to good reviews on yelp. I'd say the food was pretty good, but nothing I'd particularly recommend to anyone, and on par with just about any upscale Asian fusion in the city. Generally, almost every dish was sweet from the sauces to dressings, and thus the meal was a bit unbalanced. Specifically, the liver was bland, the tuna tartar good (bar crudo much better), the pork belly was very good, the dumplings had no taste in my opinion but my girlfriend liked them a lot, the steak was fair at best, and no more than 1/2 step above what you might cook for yourself from Safeway cuts. I found the servers to be polite, but a bit inattentive in pouring water. I did not have to wait and was immediately seated per my reservation. I did not find it too loud as others commented. At a lower price point, I'd recommend as a decent place for lunch, but probably wouldn't have dinner there again.", "author": "Andrew Z."}

I loved the food and had my first Valentine's date with my husband six years ago at the North Beach location when we were starving college students.  The food was just as good the second time.  Even though it's one of my favorite restaurants in San Francisco, I haven't been able to get back too often.  However, I have never been disappointed when I do eat at the House.  Last night, I had dinner after work with some girlfriends and we almost licked our plates clean.  The House just serves up some of the yummiest food in town.  The parking in the area sucks though and that's probably why I don't go out there too often.  I did discover a parking garage right where Chinatown meets North Beach (Pacific and Grant).  So if you're willing to throw down 6 or 7 bucks to park just a few blocks away and you make reservations in advance, you can have a pretty hassle-free and delicious meal at the House.", "author": "Lisa C."}

YUM.  i tried my friend's cod with crab special thing and that was excellent as well.  the dessert was some chocolately thing but that was super tasty too.  overall it was a very good experience but definitely a price tag to match- for my hubby and i it was at least 60 each with drinks, apps, dinner, dessert.  not sure if we'll be back but it was sure delightful.   it seemed to be the only asian fusion option in n. beach.", "author": "Ann F."}
