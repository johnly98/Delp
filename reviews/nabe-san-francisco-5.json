Similar to the original location near GGP, Nabe is at the top of the list. Why? Here's why:\n-Beautiful location and interior. With a clean 'wood' interior and sake bottles on the wall, this place provides a great atmosphere to eat in. \n-All of the broth choices come with ingredients already in the pot! Except for shabu shabu, where they put it aside for you.\n-One of the only places in the city that gives you a raw egg for dipping with your sukiyaki. For those who never had sukiyaki before, you cook your meat then dip it into a raw egg, and have that thin layer of egg cook off the burning meat right inside your mouth. Sounds kind of gross, but trust me, you'll love it. \n-They have a wide selection of sake, if you're into that.\n-Good dessert selection. They have this butter mochi cake that comes out warm and melts in your mouth, yumm! \n-Appetizers are also great. The gyoza is bite-sized and super crispy. \n-They make an after meal porridge with your remaining broth at the end. Super filling and rich in flavor. \n-Great service! The wait is never too long and although they might be slightly understaffed sometimes, they still do their best and provide great service! \n\nOverall, I love this place and would recommend this place to anybody.", "author": "Jenny N."}

Having lived in Asia, good hotpot in the states is a rare find. You crave for the hot soup during those cold days in SF - \"the coldest winter I ever spent was the summer in SF\" - yet you do not want the chemical ridden; msg pervaded; overly salty variants that are all over town.  You want something legit - a light broth that warms the soul and body from the insight out.  Enter Nabe. \n\nThe hot boiling pot. The company.  The joys. But which pot to get? Each is so wonderful in its own right. My picks?\n\n(1) The spinach and tofu salad.  I like the sesame miso dressing lightly blanketing the fresh, irony spinach, with the bits of tofu for soft texture and silliness, and sesame on top. Japanese salads are simple yet so complex at the same time. \n\n(2) Kimchi hiyayakko cold tofu.  The silken tofu is creamy and cold. Set against the sourness of the kimchee and the spiciness of the chili soy, it is a palate teaser to start a most enjoyable meal. \n\n(3) The duck (kamonanban). My favorite is the duck nabe because you get a row of high quality, thick slices of duck that beautifully line the surface of the dashi infused broth underneath, slowly extracting the juices of the duck and marinating the pieces of leek, onion, and vegetables.  \n\nWhat I also like is that each nabe is in fact 3 meals in one - representing the lifecycle of a proper hotpot. There is the first stage of satiating that anticipation for the hot, boiling soup with myriad of flavors streaming down your throat like a river of magical zen garden soup.  Then, the stage at which the flavors integrate with each other and infuse the noodles (in the case of the duck nabe, the soba noodles (the type of noodle will depend on the nabe selected)).  Last, there is the stage when the flavor concentrates even more, with the addition of rice for a soft texture - add to that egg for richness and green onion and seaweed shreds for that extra kick to round out the flavors.  \n\nThe cost is what makes this place all the more enjoyable.  At around $24-$30 a pot in SF, for this type of quality, there seems to be an element of mystery (or belevolence?) behind the nabe. \n\nI like this Iocation better than the one in inner sunset because it is more comfortable - modern, more spacious, with more thoughtful design.  The staff is always very helpful and kind.  \n\nI suggest going during weekdays or off peak hours - or simply making a reservation to avoid the long wait. \n\nNabe, nabetcha I will be back soon again!", "author": "Vivienne K."}

Ambience is also very cozy and chic Japanese.\n\nAfter you're finished, the servers will make porridge out of your leftover broth. Cool concept but.. I thought it was a little gross that each table only gets to use one person's leftover broth for everyone's porridge. I came with a close friend so it was totally fine.

All the makings of a good shabu place: a gray, foggy city (out of their control but still, kudos), a bright, airy dining area, and smooth, pale wood galore. As I walked in, I instantly felt like zen master. My heart was calmed by the sight of my fellow patrons sipping gently at their broth, steam enveloping their pink faces. \n\nThe sets were adequate for 2 small but extremely hungry people, although I would recommend adding extra meat. Vegetables-wise, things were definitely on the fluffier side (ie. a large mound of spinach magically transforms into 3 stringy leaves in the water), and lacked any exciting or out of the ordinary delights. I hungered, specifically, for more tofu. \n\nThe dipping sauce was a yuzu-y, ponzu-y delight. The real star of the show though was the porridge the server helps you make at the end of your meal. Rather than feeling shamed for my inability to consume all the resources so graciously placed in front of me, I felt celebrated and rewarded. No one agreed with me, but that porridge was fucking delicious eaten cold the next morning. \n\nSmall downside to this place is the intimate smaller shared tables.

We ordered a sukiyaki pot with the A5 wagyu beef upgrade (add on items: Enoki Mushroom, Fried Tofu, Daikon, and Udon) and the specialty sampler sake flight. I really like Japanese sukiyaki pots and this place definitely did not disappoint. The broth was perfect and the only complain I maybe have is that the fried tofu is not actually fried tofu, more like fried tofu skin/curd. And after we finished the pot, the server made us rice porridge (zosui) from our leftover broth, which was just the cherry on top! The rice porridge was so amazing I finished my portion even though I was so full after finishing the pot. It was a in between of the Chinese porridge and risotto texture, which was so creamy as I'm writing this review I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.\n\nIt's a pretty pricey place for shabu but I'm definitely sold with the delicious food and exceptional service.

Even before we realized we needed a refill of water the servers were already there. \n\nDrink: (5 stars) great drink options if you're looking for quality and drink. Really great quality sakes.

I tried this beer first at the Giants ballpark Pub and was pleasantly surprised when I found it at Nabe. Goes really well with the shabu, super refreshing. \n\nFood: (5 stars) quality of the beef is unmatched in the city. You can get A5 Wagyu beef and I would definitely recommend trying it! All of the broths are quite delicious. I've tried the Kimchee, Miso (spicy) and Sukiyaki. Definitely recommend getting two broths which will then come with 2 meats if you're having dinner with at least one other person. \n\nNote: If you're vegan the miso broth is made I think only with mushroom so it would be a great option. \n\nAt the end of the meal they have a finisher which is the broth mixed with rice that they make into a congee like dish.

Walking inside reminds me of a japanese bathhouse!  \n\nHot pot is rather expensive (~25 or more per) in most cases but the value here is great.  They seem to have about 4-5 hostesses who handle all the work in terms of taking orders.  They are really responsive and nice.  The food is quite incredible, as I feel with most hot pot places.  This specific restaurant allows the guests to cook the meat and vegetables in the pot in front of you.  Depending on the broth you choose, a different selection of meat and vegetable will incur. \n\nThe meat selection is great, we had the wagyu regular and pork belly.  The meat was tender and works well in the broth or on rice.  As a finishing touch, they turn your leftover broth into a porridge teeming with the flavors of the boiled vegetables and meat you've just consumed!  \n\nI did not order drinks but they had a great selection of bottled japanese beers and a few draft options as well. \n\nGreat hot pot for Chestnut!", "author": "Joel Christian A."}

Basically it means \"things in a pot.\"  \n\nWe visited this location on a weekday and found that there was no wait around 6pm.  We were seated immediately as we pretty much already knew what we wanted to order.  I ended up ordering the duck while wifey went with the shabu.\n\nBoth were served with different dipping sauces.  They definitely complemented the broth and meat that we each ordered.  The server was very descriptive and ensured that everyone in the restaurant knew how to cook everything.  The duck was super tender and I loved the other ingredients served with it.  They strategically placed the longer cooking items on the bottom of the pot.  The shabu was decent.  Not the best we've ever had but definitely appreciated the simplicity of it all.  \n\nThe best part of our meal?  The porridge that the server makes at the end.  Pick a broth and watch them make it before your eyes.  We went with the duck side as he described it as being more traditional.  It was delicious!!!  I couldn't help but go back for the rest that was in the pot. I'd come back here just for that.  \n\nStreet parking available.

The layout is unique and efficient; basically a rectangle where the servers can walk around the whole place. They have bathroom at the front, kitchen in back, beers on tap near front, and seating down the middle that doesn't have back rests and it's a big long communal table that's split into sections...it's actually a really cute compact place. Even the opening is this huge black steel looking door without a handle you just push it but apparently there's a lot of that in Japan so it's pretty cool they keep it authentic. \n\nAlthough this place is good, it can get pricey if you're super hungry. Food was actually really good meat and sauces but the one thing that was starting to annoy me was the slow service. Food took awhile to come but we at least expected the hot sake to be fast but we had to remind them 2 more times before we got it. The wagyu is the best but the pork belly is actually really good also. \n\nAsk for the sesame sauce since they don't automatically bring it.

We started with the cold tofu and kimchi, which was delicious and balanced. We both love it. (And my companion doesn't think she's a kimchi person.)  We also ordered the large Seafood Yosenabe. The broth is absolutely delicious, and there were generous amounts of seafood, mushrooms and vegetables. It was lovely as is, and though we had multiple servings, we couldn't finish the whole pot. We also ordered a side of rice. That was nice, but I was underwhelmed. (confession - I almost alway prefer Haiga rice (half milled - between white and brown and much more flavorful than regular white rice, but still soft, and yummy.)  The Yosenable was served with glass noodles, which were good. However, the amount of noodles was underwhelming. Would have liked more. Each of us got just a tiny portion.

You do have to old school call the restaurant to do that as they don't have an Opentable presence yet. \n\n[Nabe]\nI've tried the Sukiyaki, Kamonanban, and Spicy Miso Shabu Shabu. The Kamonanban is definitely something special I've never had duck in hot pot before (I always go for lamb), but the duck meat used was great quality and extremely tender. The sukiyaki wasn't that special for me, I enjoyed the high quality beef used, but didn't really like the soup broth that much. I would recommend splitting your pot and at least trying to get the Spicy Miso Broth. The duck came with soba and the sukiyaki and the Shabu came with udon. I like the nice mix of napa cabbage, spinach, mushrooms, and tofu that also came with the set. It really makes the congee that is made at the end from the cooked broth taste way better after the servers add rice! I always have a problem of overeating at hot pot meals (especially at Chinese hot pot places), but I left Nabe comfortably full and satisfied from the rice porridge at the end. \n\n[Drinks]\nGreat sake selection and the restaurant also has cold Asahi on tap. Great shabu pairings!\n\n[Service]\nI definitely feel that the place is understaffed. This probably is because the restaurant just opened and they don't have a feel for crowd control yet. However, all the servers were really nice and performed super efficiently given the demanding environment of shabu diners. I put my name down and one of the servers told me the wait would be one hour; however, ten minutes later after I had driven away, they told me that a table had opened up. I was kind of annoyed, but my desire for hotpot overwhelmed my need for instantly gratifying my stomach so I did a quick U-turn and sped right back. I'm really glad i did. \n\n[Decor]\nOne long table surrounded by smaller tables of 4 and two.

But I'll get down to the specifics:\n\nMeat/Broth - I got the beef sukiyaki (one of my favs). The broth was standard, and the meat was okay. For the 'wagyu' beef, it was not quite tender and a little tougher than I would have expected for shabu beef. I feel beef I can get a XFY or Shabu House is better quality. \n\nVeggies - Good selection. Except they put it all in the pot for you before they bring it out. This causes two issues: 1) it takes forever to boil the broth now, at least 10 minutes of us sitting and waiting. 2) some veggies will get very soggy because you're not usually going to eat them all at the same time (i.e. pumpkin, napa). I can see a reasoning for this being that they want to save table space, but I'd much rather have my veggies come on a plate so that I can cook them as I want.\n\nRice porridge at the end - this is good! I love the addition of egg and negi. It's a good, cheap way for them to fill you up and use some of the broth at the end. Nice addition.\n\nService was good, clientele is very Marina however, so if you want a normal Shabu experience, I'd try Shabu House as well and pick what you like best.", "author": "Ryan D."}

The host was doubling as a server, and the other servers were impossible to flag down.\n\nFirst off, you'll want to make a reservation. We waited close to 1.5 hours and were hangry, to say the least. We ordered as soon as we were seated and still had to wait 45 minutes for our food to arrive. I think I heard someone being quoted a 2-hour wait toward the end of the night. The party next to us had to ask 3 separate people for the check.\n\nI will say that if you like Japanese hot pot, the broth and ingredients here are high quality. I love shabu shabu in general and Nabe is one of the few spots in the city that I know about. The sukiyaki is a great mix of beef and vegetables, and the complementary rice porridge at the end is an excellent way to end the meal.\n\nThis location is much bigger than the Inner Sunset one, but they need to double the staff and streamline their process if they want to make customers happy.\n\nOverall, the food is good but the experience was SO bad that I will probably wait a long time before I return.

All I could think of was a bowl of hot broth.  I always stay in the Marina with a friend and it is common knowledge that area of town is not known for good options of Asian cuisine.  Nabe popped up on my Yelp radar and I though it worth a shot.  Upon arrival we were warmly greeted by the hostess who sat us immediately.  The modern interior could have been a little stark for a cold winter night but she sat us in a cozy corner which was just perfect.  We were promptly waited on and given some tips on best approaches to order.  Selections were made for cucumber and octopus salads to start and the Seafood Yosenabe with the spicy miso broth and the Kamonanban (duck) for main. I ordered Sake as well and when it arrived I realized I had ordered unfiltered instead of filtered.  I told the waitress I had intended filtered and clearly made a mistake on my end.  She said it wasn't a problem and immediately replaced it without issue.  \n\nThe food arrived and we were in awe.  Fabulous seafood selection and enticing duck floated atop their respective broths nestled in veggies.  After about 10 minutes of cooking we dove in.  Both equally flavorful but distinctly different, I could not decide which I favored.  The fish was delicate and the duck tender.  Veggies were fresh and cut perfectly so as not to be overcooked.  At the end of the meal when only broth remained in our hot pot the waitress approached and said they finish off with broth with a rice porridge.  We opted for the spicy miso seafood version and began the creation of rice, egg, a little more broth and a finishing garnish.  It was divine!  Rich, velvety, tender rice porridge.

I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to make a reservation - just make a call and say the time you'd like to eat, and voila! I was also impressed that there was a followup call to confirm, as well as the advice to move the reservation slightly back just to guarantee our table. \n\nThere's still no signage on the outside of the new Nabe yet, so keep your eyes peeled! Parking wasn't too hard to find, and there's some seating at the front, as well as easy access to the bathroom while you wait.

Special shoutouts to the udon noodles (these noodles were ridiculously good for some reason) and the mochi (this comes with the kimchi/pork belly platter, and becomes so soft and delicious after being boiled).  \n\nEven if you're really full, get the rice porridge that they make at the end!!! I wanted to try it because I was so skeptical of previous reviews that had mentioned it, but it really was a great end to the meal.  \n\nThere definitely are still some kinks to be worked out, as there are with any new restaurant.  For instance, they had shortages on bowls and had to collect our bowls from the table to give us our sides of rice (not a big deal, but a little noticeable since I had used my bowl already).  Also they ran out of miso after we had ordered, but came by to offer us replacement broths instead (it would actually be really helpful to have a rundown of the different kinds of broths somewhere on the menu?)  Also, that weird delay between sitting down and getting our food - I'm guessing shabu shabu should be fairly quick with coming out, but I could be wrong! \n\nService was really fantastic, though I would love to have more outgoing service (especially since this was my family's first visit and we had no idea what was going on).  Carol, the manager at this location, was incredibly polite and patient, and answered all the questions that we had.  My brother did note that we were an exceptionally large party and probably would have received better service if we weren't divided into two tables.  \n\nOverall, a very good meal (my cousin is telling me to mention that she and her sister really, really liked it, and that I burned my tongue multiple times forgetting how hot the food was), but with some things that still need to be improved a little bit. I hope to be back, maybe to the original location next time.", "author": "Cat D."}

I really enjoyed the environment. \n\nService was great too. The servers that helped us were friendly, and never rushing or curt. \n\nWe started off with the pork gyoza and those were delicious! My boyfriend and I got a split pot of the duck breast in dashi broth and wagyu beef in spicy miso. I highly recommend both! The dashi broth was not too salty or too sweet and the spicy miso was simply satisfying. I love duck and usually eat it more on the medium/medium rare, so it was my mistake the keep the meat in the broth for the entire meal. It was still very tender so that's probably why I didn't bother too much. \n\nI also love the fact that they offer sides of mochi as an add-on. I once had udon with mochi in New York and was obsessed with it. I have yet to find a place in the bay where mochi is eaten with a more savory/broth meal. \n\nThe porridge they prepare for you at the end of the meal was also a nice touch. We decided to have them make it with the spicy miso broth and that was a great choice because of the kick of heat. \n\nVery solid restaurant and I will definitely be back.", "author": "Kelly L."}

Our waitress was very unfriendly, after we left we all remarked that it seemed like she hated us (not really sure why - we were a mellow and happy group)! \n\nWe had mentioned right away that we had never been there and weren't really familiar with hot pot in general. Despite that, she provided no help at all to acquaint us to what we should do with the stove, when to put food into the pot, or any explanation of the menu. When we asked these basic questions, she sort of just huffed about it and didn't explain. \n\nThat said, we figured everything out, and the food was pretty good! We had the kimchi with mochi. It was spicy and flavorful, but only came with 4 small cubes of mochi, which was sort of disappointing. We also ordered it with pork belly, which seems to have just been regular strips of bacon (like you'd have at a diner breakfast), whereas we were expecting thicker cut pork with some fat on it. However, the assorted mushroom ad-on was great and a generous portion. \n\nMy group also did the basic sake flight and one other flight. It was a little confusing which way the chart went in terms of knowing which we were tasting. (Our waitress seemed very annoyed, yet again, that we asked which way the flights were organized.) However, the selection was delicious and well varied for both! \n\nOverall, the food was pretty good, the service was fine but not friendly, and the space was really nice.

Making a reservation for this place is as easy as their original restaurant, just have to call in and WALA, we're in. Parking is slightly better but given that it's in Marina, I'd say we probably just got lucky.\n\nThis new restaurant is definitely a step up, it's bigger (not an significant increase in number of seating) in terms of more square footage per person. It's not as stuffy and say no more to condensation on the window. I can finally breathe better and not soak up that shabu smell since ventilation is better.\n\nLooks like they transferred some of the original staff to this new location. At least I'm not being served by new trainees, needless to say, the staff is great. Even when the restaurant is getting packed and they're running around, they still manage to stop by our table to ask how we are doing.\n\nThe only drawback is that the meat took awhile to come out. Given that this place is new, I'm hoping they will smooth out things in the kitchen so it runs smoother and faster.\n\nThe food itself is still good.

The space is beautiful, and the decor is modern and stylish. I was so excited since everything looked beautiful and the hostess was professional, but once my boyfriend and I were seated the mediocre service started. Our server handed us the menus, took our drink order, and then we didn't see her for another 10-15 minutes. When she came back with our drinks, she didn't ask if we were ready to order, and we had to flag her down again. We ordered the sukiyaki broth with an order of beef and pork with extra mushrooms and veggies.\n\nOur food didn't come for over 45 minutes, which by itself was pretty annoying. However, there is apparently a time limit because they are so busy, and they kicked out the party of two next to us who stayed too long.  I'm not sure when they time it or how long the limit is but given our wait for the food, I hope it's calculated by when the food arrives. I don't know if there was a massive backup or something in the kitchen, but my boyfriend and I were starving and we had no idea what was going on. Then, our food arrived with no apology or explanation. To add insult to injury, there was a party behind us that arrived about half an hour after we did. We received our food at the same time. \n\nThe food itself was mostly good. The beef and pork were delicious and the quality was fantastic even without the upgrade; there was an average/smaller amount of vegetables than we would have liked but they were fresh and tasty. However, we were so disappointed by the sukiyaki broth because it was incredibly bland and there was so little sweetness that you could only detect it at the end when all the broth had boiled down. We enjoyed the porridge at the end, and it was a nice touch to ensure that you were completely stuffed before leaving. \n\nWe might come back in the future to give it one more chance because the meat was fantastic, and we'll pray that Nabe just had an understaffed off night.

Right when we got seated we were ready to order lol b/c we were so hungry! The restaurant is pretty small and it's probably the same size as the one on Irving.

We got a big plate of veggies and a plate of meat. My boyfriend ordered the large one but it didn't seem like it was a lot for him lol.

We ended up having to pay pretty high prices for a small portion of ingredients to fill us up such as noodles and extra vegetables.

When I was looking for the actual restaurant, it took a bit to fine because the entrance was so nondescript.  The door was just a big black door, no signs or anything.  Made feel like one of those secret places that only selected people know.\n\nThe inside of the restaurant was very nice and modern.  The food was awesome.  We got the duck based soup and it was on point.  The beef and pork belly was incredible.  But the best part was when we were done with the food.  They used the soup base to make a porridge.  That was the best.  \n\nThere will be a next time and many more to come.", "author": "Charles L."}

Me and my friends got 2 items, required to get more than 1 item when the party is 3 or more people. We tried both miso and spicy miso broth and I really like the spicy. The regular miso broth is too blend and does not have much flavor. We had both regular nabe with beef and a vegetarian one. Unfortunately vegetarian one cannot have a spicy miso since one ingredient in the broth is bonito flakes, which is fish. There was not as much meat as i wanted even when we got a large and ordering additional meat was a little too expensive in my opinion. But the overall experience was great. The porridge was so good! I did not expect it but it was a pleasant surprise. I tired their house mochi cakedessert with sesame ice cream and it was average.", "author": "Hayoung K."}

Try getting a raw egg and dip the beef in the sauce then egg - changed my world. They also serve this really good beer called Harajuku Girl\u00a0from Holy Craft Brewing Company. It's brewed with Yuzu and has a nice citrus flavor that works with hot pot. Definitely recommend pairing. For dessert they have mochi pound cake with black sesame ice cream that disappears after about two minutes for some tasty reason.", "author": "Klaus S."}

I highly recommend the duck breast. However, I wouldn't recommend coming here in large groups. I just got back from there with a group of 14, and service was very very subpar. Not only did we have to wait a long time for our entire order to be delivered (our waitress forgot that we had ordered the duck), but they informed us that they ran out of rice (...what? this is a hot pot restaurant) while making our congi at the end. Also, the menu states in small text at the bottom that we only get one pot of congi per group. We asked the waiter if the rule could be relaxed, since we were obviously a very large group, and had occupied 4 hot pot tabletops. She declined, and offered us to make another pot of congi with extra udon (we would be charged extra). We asked if we would get separate servings if we came in 4-5 smaller groups instead of one large group, and she said yes. This rule makes no sense, and unless it's changed, I don't think it makes sense to bring your large group of friends to Nabe.", "author": "Anarghya M."}

You can definitely taste the difference in quality in both their meat and broth. \n\nMy friend and I ordered a split pot with wagyu beef with spicy Miso and half duck breast with Dashi broth. We also ordered the kurobuta sausage as appetizer.. and everything was just amazing. Their spicy Miso base actually had flavor! Now I've been to quite a few Shabu places and their Miso soup base is always a disappointment because either it's not spicy or there's no flavor. Not this place! It was spicy and actually tasted like Miso! \n\nRight when we were about to call for the bill our waitress told us that there was more food! Apparently they use your leftover broth and make a rice porridge with it. We chose to use the Dashi broth since we didn't want spicy porridge. It was sooo good! The porridge tasted kind of sweet and smoky. It's hard to explain but trust me, you'll get what I mean when you try it for yourself. We were literally holding our stomachs because we were so full... but let me tell you now that it is a MUST TRY! They also have quite an extensive menu of Sake and Japanese Beer. Big plus!! \n\nSurprisingly, even though it's located on a busy street we had no trouble finding parking at all. I'll be back!!", "author": "Catherine C."}

I LOVE the dashi broth! It's a soy base broth that's savory and so flavorful. The portions were perfect and they also give you a complimentary rice porridge at the end.

Not too thick, clean, and perfectly spicy. The wife loved her spicy miso broth and mushroom/vegetarian option. The house made ramen noodles were excellent. Even though we were happily stuffed, the rice porridge with fresh egg/green onion/seaweed the waiter made with the leftover broth was the cherry on top.
