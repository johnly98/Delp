But it was just a awful experience.\n\n The three of us went for the lunch buffet and the waiter was really rude. It was pretty empty in there so there wasn't a lot of people to deal with. 4 whatever reason he did not want to give my friend sugar for her chai tea. He argued with her that she didn't need it and after asking for the third time finally gave her some sugar. He then got upset cuz we put dirty plates in the table next to us because we had no room to put them he never came by to pick up the dirty plates in the first place. We came to have lunch not deal with someone's rudeness and bad attitude.\n\nI asked to speak to the manager more leaving but I can only talk to another of the employees he was really nice but we won't be going back.", "author": "Henry Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-02-24", "description": "I've been disappointed by the Indian buffets in San Francisco thus far, so when my friend suggested hitting up one after our urban hike, I braced myself for more of the same. I was pleasantly surprised by the weekend lunch buffet at India Clay Oven, and while it's not my Favorite Indian Restaurant (Union City shoutout), it'll do in a pinch when I'm craving Indian in the city.\n\nRating Breakdown:\n1.5/2 Stars for Taste --\nI always judge a buffet by the classics -- tikka masala and saag. India Clay Oven nails it in both respects. Be warned, the saag paneer has a bit of a kick! I also really enjoyed the tandoori chicken, which was by far some of the moistest I have tried. I regretted not trying some until the end when I was already fit to burst. The naan was served hot and not overly bready or hard like some other places. It had almost the elastic texture of a green onion pancake, which I really enjoyed. I was not thrilled with the kheer, it tasted more like vanilla than cardamom...but how mad can you be at creamy sweetness? The fish pakora was more fried bits than fish. The peas in the mixed vegetables dish tasted almost like they had been previously frozen (the cauliflower was good though!).\n\n0.5/1 Stars for Value --\nBefore tip, it was about $13 per person. There isn't a huge array of options, but all the basics are covered (two types of pakora, tandoori chicken, three types of curry, two types of dessert). My only complaint is that there wasn't complimentary chai. \n\n1/1 Stars for Customer Service --\nOur server came by constantly to fill our waters. We ate too quickly for him to take our plates though because we would just stack them and continue eating like savages.\n\nBonus star because this is currently my favorite Indian buffet in the city and I'd come back when the cravings hit.", "author": "Abby W."}

The masala sauce was good and not overly spicy (how I prefer it) and the portion sizes were just right.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-11-17", "description": "Had lunch here after a movie with a companion. The entryway is very pretty, and the inside of the restaurant has ceiling-to-floor glass walls, making for potentially romantic lighting during the evening. Plus they add little candles to the table during the later hours! Too bad we went during daylight - even in the afternoon it's a beautiful date location.\n\nAnyways. Past the decor. Place was fairly empty when we walked in, so we weren't sure what to expect, but our food all came in delicious. First came the vegetable samosas and garlic nan, both of which were crisp and well-seasoned. Potatoes inside the samosas were salt-and-buttery, a contrast to the sweetness and firmness of the peas, and wonderful with or without the sharp sauce provided to eat it with. (There's two that you're given - a sweet, darker sauce, almost syrupy, and a hot green dip. Both are lovely.)\n\nThen the entrees. I ordered the Punjabi lamb curry (requested extra spicy) and my companion the aloo matter with an additional side of jasmine rice. Rice was a little dry, but otherwise fine. The curry - which the waiter put on the table with a rather concerned look - was a pleasant burn, spicy enough to enflame my otherwise heat-tolerant mouth and put a warm ache in my stomach. Word of warning: I do love spicy food, so for the uninitiated please proceed with caution if you want to go with my recommendation.\n\nFor the $14 or so I spent on it the proportion of lamb to sauce was staggering! Very generous with the meat, and properly cooked as well, both of which are two strong bonuses in my book. My companion reported that her food was delicious as well, but I wasn't able to get a detailed report from her. I trust her judgement, though.\n\nTaking off a star only because the waiter was nearly silent. Not unwelcoming or unfriendly, just a bit off-putting. I'm not asking for Chik-Fil-A levels of friendliness, but even a \"hello, how's your evening going\" or \"how was the food\" would've sufficed. The difference between restaurant dining and takeout, after all, lies primarily in service and atmosphere.\n\nOther than that, food was great, well-spiced. Order the samosas (they're delicious) and come during the evening for a more intimate experience.", "author": "Nin K."}

It used to be a great lunch buffet place and after not having been in several months, we went today. First off, the creepy factor is at an all time high. Three or four waiters gathered about and just watched us walk in, making us feel as though we interrupted some murder-for-hire plan. We sat down and the waiter poured water in our glasses, (filling one up only a quarter of the way and not returning. We'd asked for iced tea as we sat down so had to get up and ask him for tea and more water. \n\nWhen we got up for seconds, the creepiest of waiters followed us and watched every move we made. Then when I was finally going up to get my favorite - the rice pudding dessert, it was no longer there, and in it's place was a big cardboard tub of freezer-burned ice cream. I asked about it and he said, \"We don't have rice pudding\". I wanted to say, \"Listen here, mother f'er, I saw it with my own two eyes!\", but instead I just left him a 10% tip. It was really a weird vibe and the worst service we have had...oh yeah! The guy was also talking on his cell phone while pouring someone else's water. We got a good chuckle out of that one. \n\nBottom line, unless you want to eat at a place that feels like the abandoned restaurant in Goonies, you're better going elsewhere.", "author": "Ann S."}

I came in the evening and ordered a hefty meal consisting of tandoori chicken, tikka masala, saag paneer, garlic naan, and cucumber salad.\n\nThe tandoori chicken came out scalding hot on a skillet fresh from the kitchen. It was succulent, seasoned perfectly and made my mouth water.\n\nThe tikka masala likewise was tender and juicy and quickly disappeared along with my rice.\n\nSaag paneer is a personal favorite of mine and India Clay Oven's saag paneer did not disappoint. The cheese and spinach were creamily melted together and complemented each other beautifully.\n\nMy only gripes (which are not enough to render my review a 4-star) are the cucumber salad and the service. First, the cucumber salad wasn't so much a salad as much as it was cucumbers and tomatoes in a yogurt dressing. Minimalistic would be a generous use of the word to describe the salad. Regardless, the salad is enjoyable. Second, the service was quite slow, it took our server a good deal of time to get to us, and the place was hardly busy. An additional server didn't speak any English, and while it didn't present any major problems for me, I could see it being a problem for more complex orders or requests.\n\nAll-in-all, I always look forward coming to India Clay Oven; the decor is lovely and the food is delicious!", "author": "George K."}

This place is the real deal. While some cheapo Indian/Pakistani places try to hide the old lamb in a super spicy curry, that has not been my experience here. Everything is fresh, beautifully balanced, the spices correct, the cilantro dipping sauce (and the tamarind sauce!) are perfecto --ask for Medium or Spicy if you want a healthful high! -- and never ever forget to order onion kulcha and/or garlic naan.\n\nMy personal favorites: Tandoori Mixed Grill, Lamb Biryani, Saag Paneer, the Hyderabadi curries, the tikka masala of course, and... the pakoras! I've come to love the spinach pakoras in particular... with that killer cilantro sauce they are to die for! But they've got to be hot. If you get delivery and they're not hot, then do yourself a favor & throw them on a little cookie sheet in the toaster oven at 400 for 5 mins. Then dip them into those outrageous sauces. And order Spicy. You won't be sorry. Your body will thank you. Cheers!", "author": "Rebecca R."}

So on lazy days when I'm craving comfort food, more times than not I decide to order Indian food!\n\nDelivery order from December 2013 thru delivery dot com:\n\nVegetable samosa ($4.95) - The only redeeming thing about this meal. Nicely fried. Potato and pea filling was contrasted nicely with the fried shell.\n\nChicken tikka masala ($12.95) - I asked for this extra spicy. And though it did have a kick, I couldn't get over the bitterness of the dish. It made it hard to eat.\n\nChicken vindaloo ($12.95) - Sooo bitter! So much so that I couldn't eat it! I don't know what they decided to add to the curries to made them extra spicy, but I just couldn't eat this one at all!\n\nGarlic naan ($2.95) - Super oily and doughy. As if it wasn't cooked all the way through. Part of the goodness of naan is that I can sop up the delicious curry! Even though the curry in this case was awful, when trying to dip the oily naan, the curry just fell off. Sooo bad!\n\nOnion kulcha ($2.95) - Same thing as the garlic naan. Super oily and doughy. \n\nPrawn biryani ($15.95) - Sooo mushy! Part of the reason I order rice is to mixed it with the curries I order. Since it was so mushy, the flavors just didn't blend together well.\n\nSo this was an Indian food fail!

Usually I enjoy spicy food but they made it to the point where it hurt. The food was good but it was unnecessarily spicy. If you enjoy your internal organs don't order spicy. Get medium or mild. You can thank me later. \n\nI still ate everything because i'm not a quitter, but it was definitely a struggle. Through the sweat and tears, in the battle of man v. spice, man won (this time). Thus I leave my word to the wise. The food was good, don't get me wrong, and the portions were a good size, but it was just CRAZY spicy. \n\nAlso my order came to about 41 bucks which is odd for an Indian restaurant. However this is the closest Indian place to me, and after running a half marathon, I was not about to venture anywhere for food. Despite some great food in the neighborhood, the Richmond actually doesn't have much of an Indian presence, as say, the Sunset. \n\n I will have to try it again and order medium (learned my lesson).", "author": "Thielson D."}

The server was also personable and greeted us pleasantly when we arrived.  Although there was not a huge selection, the offerings for the most part were all prepared well and tasted delicious.  Tandoori chicken was also juicy and tender and not dried out as it can get at some Indian buffets.  We also ordered mango lassis which were nice and tart.  The only criticism regarding the food was that they placed the fish pakora and the gulab jamun in covered containers which caused them to steam and overcook, rather than the fish remaining crispy had it not been under a lid.  The gulab jamun also was overcooked due to this.  Not a huge deal, but some things for the restaurant to note and correct.

However, unfortunately, the last two times have been a huge disappointment. The chicken was very, very dry both times and the last time the delivery person (in-house driver, I was told, not a third-party provided driver) didn't have any change. If a restaurant accepts cash upon delivery, then wouldn't it be a wise practice to prepare sufficient change for your delivery employees, especially if a customer specifically gives you a heads up in advance, when they order, that they will need change? Sadly, delivery also slowed down to an average of about 1-1.5 hrs the last couple times, with the food arriving cold, and, as I mentioned, the chicken dry. These most recent experiences makes all of my experiences average out to just an overall so-so now, hence the three stars.", "author": "I Like T."}

We were the first customers to arrive for the buffet at 11am. The restaurant was nice and really clean inside.\n\nThe chicken tikka masala was amazing! It was full of flavor. I also loved the veggie curry and the veggie pakora. The veggies weren't overcooked. The lentils dish was tasty as well. The fish pakora was alright. Their naan on the other hand, was buttery and soft. So delicious!\n\nThe service was pretty good. The waiter kept our glasses of water filled. My only gripe was that he gave us naan after we had already finished our first round at the buffet. But, besides that, you truly can't go wrong for a $10 buffet. I'd definitely come back!", "author": "Fallon P."}

It is intimidating at first but the waiters are really really nice and they always wait for you to be ready to approach you and take your order or take your plates away. \n\nThey start you off with some flaky chip thing as an appetizer along with different kinds of dip. It was pretty good and a different taste from what I normally eat. We got fried eggplants, yogurt marinated chicken, and chicken with mushrooms. The food was all pretty decent but they don't all come with rice so make sure you are clear on what you order. The chicken was really tender and moist for the yogurt marinated chicken but the chicken with the mushroom was a bit dry. They also gave us dessert on the house, which was some sweet rice dessert.

Another thing I love about this restaurant is their full length glass window walls! Plenty of sunlight coming thru on a nice day! Ambiance is nice, noise level acceptable. Will recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a little romantic sitting with good Indian foods. \n\nThey serve buffet lunch (I think it is everyday cuz whenever I went there during lunch time, buffet is available) or you can order from the menu. I love their buffet, delicious foods, decent price (like $10-ish per person), also they serve freshly made naan. I think hot fresh naan are way better, so it is a plus. The value of the buffet is good considering the menu prices. \n\nI think their nice ambiance also comes with a higher menu prices! Their menu prices probably on average 30% more than the other Indian restaurants. I usually pay $8ish for chicken tikka masala, theirs is probably $12 for the same thing! So I think they overcharge a bit, but also can't complain too much because their restaurant also looks a little higher class than the others (like naan n curry, shalimar, pakwan, etc). \n\nWill recommend this restaurant for a nice ambiance, good foods, and on a sunny day.", "author": "Lena H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-08-03", "description": "So very sad.  I had come here for the lunch buffet once before & thought it was ok, not bad, but not great.  The husband & I were in the area decided to stop by & try them for dinner.  BIG mistake.  First bad sign was the restaurant was nearly empty on a Saturday evening (peak hours), there were more staff than customers in the restaurant & the staff did not bother to hide their boredom by texting or being on their cell phones.  \n\nOur waiter was ok he was trying to be cordial, but unfortunately was a little difficult to understand.  I don't know if it is the norm for them, but he kind of nickel & dimed us into ordering extra $2 raita & $2 mango chutney & then an extra order of rice as well as a double order of garlic naan.  I mean, it was partially our fault, but there are only so many times you can say \"excuse me?\", or \"what was that?\".  Be careful!\n\nOn to the food!\n\nOk so they give you a free order of papadum which (aside from the condiment sauces) was the most flavorful dish of the evening.  \n\nAppetizer Meat Sampler:  Meat on a sizzling grill with onion & bell peppers.  Nothing exciting, but not bad.  Good with the green chutney.\n\nAloo Palaak (spinach & potato):  This is one of my favorite dishes & I always look forward to trying it at different Indian restaurants.  The appearance of the dish was typical.  It looks like creamed spinach with chunks of potato in it.  There was a part of it that looked like a \"skin\", kind of like when a dish has been sitting out too long & that top layer dries out.  I didn't really think about it until after we tried it.  You'd think that if it had been sitting it would have really concentrated the flavor, but it didn't have any flavor.  It was extremely BLAND.  It didn't taste like Indian food.  It tasted like overcooked spinach and potato, it didn't even seem salted.  We actually sent this back.  \n\nWhen I sent the Aloo Palaak dish back I asked the server to have the chef try the dish because it was so bad, I had to prod the server to let me know what the chef thought.  Ultimately I'm not sure if he really tasted it or not but the server told us the chef did say it tasted plain.  \n\nBecause we sent the aloo palaak back, they were nice enough to ask if we wanted something instead of the aloo palaak.  Decided to order an Indian food that almost never fails......  Chicken Tikka Masala boy were we disappointed.\n\nChicken Tikka Masala:   It was kind of frightening how quickly this came out.  They must have had this ready in the back also because it was brought to our table within 1 minute of our order.   So, when I've had this in the past at different Indian restaurants, the sauce is thick & creamy and flavorful.  Unfortunately, the chicken tikka masala was extremely watery & flavorless.  The chicken was totally bland.  I had to ask for salt, this is something I've NEVER had to do at an Indian restaurant, but we didn't want to send another dish back.  We didn't finish this either.\n\nLamb Vindaloo:  Watery, watery, watery.  The sauce seemed under seasoned and was very thin and tasteless.  It was almost like lamb with canned tomato & a little bit of seasoning, but not enough to make it taste good.  No spice at all!   The husband was ok with it so we didn't send it back, but we didn't finish this dish. \n\nGarlic Naan:  Just wasn't garlicky.  There were small garlic particles on the bread, but not enough to really taste the garlic.  I could barely smell the garlic either which was weird.  Maybe they use dried garlic flakes, not fresh garlic (which is really just a sin being this close to Gilroy).  \n\nAnyway, if you haven't gotten it yet, the food was not good.  I really tried to like the food.  They really did try to make things ok, but if they aren't making tasty food, they can't fix the problem.  They even made us an order of the Aloo Paalak to go & the server told us the chef told him it was going to be really good.  Unfortunately, on our way home both the husband & I started feeling ill & decided it wouldn't be a good idea to eat anything else from the restaurant.  \n\nFinally, as far as cleanliness, it was ok overall.  The restaurant is beautiful.  They have fresh roses on the tables, they have beautiful murals & the outer dining room is like a sunroom.  The restroom is clean overall, but there were no paper towels.  One of the many employees that were texting or using their cell phones could have filled the paper towel dispenser.  \n\nI wish I could give them more stars but I just cant.  I feel if they could get the kitchen in order that the restaurant could do so well, but clearly they have been failing in that area for some time (hence empty dining room).

I ordered Aloo Gobi, which is supposed to be full of flavor.  This was not.  Everyone ordered other items at the table which all seemed to find a way to be equally bad for whatever reason. Even the rice was dried out and sad.  My seat faced the kitchen, which had trash all over the floor.

Curry and rice is just about the most comforting duo for me. \n\nI always come here for the buffet because, yeah, I don't want my ratio of rice and curry to be dictated by what the chef feels like $14.95 is worth. I like drowning my rice in tikka masala or vindaloo, and eating more rice with lamb curry. Anyways, this place is pretty standard in terms of variety(in order of my opinion of what is best): chicken tikka masala, lamb curry, vegetable korma, tandoori chicken, fried carrot dessert. I've been to most indian buffets in the city, because that's what you do in your college years. And as I've grown, quality becomes a bit more standard and for sure india clay oven is the best of all the ones in the richmond + sunset.\n\nStaff has never treated me unkind, consistent good service.

I had visited India Clay Oven a couple of times about a year ago. The place hadn't really made much of an impression. I only remembered it because I liked the look of the interior. Very neat and clean. It seemed time to give it another try. The place was empty, but so was my belly. Trying to stay positive, we were glad not to have to wait for seating. \n\nAs we prepare to order the waiter is almost sneering at us. Maybe he's having a bad night? I ask for veggie samosas, spicy lamb biryani, and spicy lamb vindaloo. We make sure to let him know we want it very spicy. His face still openly showing contempt, he says \"Oh, spicy, yes. Sure.\",  as he writes something down. I decide we definitely need to try a different waiter if we need anything. \n\nWhile the samosas were fine, the biryani and vindaloo were just unbelievably bland. After all the waiting, this is what we get? I would have sent it back, but all the other waiters seemed equally unhappy with a sneer here and a grimace there. What's wrong with these people? I showered this morning. I'm wearing a shirt, and my shoes. Where's the service? I didn't want any \"special sauce\" added along with the spices, so I just grimaced back and kept eating their sludge. No wonder this place was empty.\n\nGiven the price, the bland food, and the horrid service I would give this place zero stars if I could. I hate negative reviews. I'd like to end on an up beat.

The main entrees all came out at the same time - too early - in fact, before I was even halfway through my vegetable samosa appetizer.   \n\nThough the flavors of the sauces were delicious, the portions seemed small to me; I started having to dig for tikka masala sauce, even with half my rice and most of my naan remaining.  The cheese cubes in the sag paneer were too mild and therefore, tasted rather bland in the spinach sauce.  I highly recommend the tikka masala and the korma sauce (with your own preferred meats)... not just at this place, but in general.  \n\nLastly, there is only a single (unisex) restroom for the entire facility, meaning only one person can use the restroom at a time... seems a little risky for an Indian restaurant.", "author": "Carol Y."}

Nice huge glass windows that keep you warm in the foggy Outer Richmond. \n\nAs for the buffet.. we arrived around 1 pm and almost all the trays were empty. They never really got around to filling them up the whole time we were there. Which is really shady if it's supposed to be a buffet. Although I will have to say the items we did taste were pretty good. I liked the fish pakora best, esp when it was salmon. The lamb curry was very good. It's too bad the food was good because we wished they filled up the trays with it since you know it's a buffet! Also, the waiters were like zombies, no personality whatsoever, no smile, no emotion, blah. And their vests were soooo dirty! Very un-appetizing to see in a restaurant. The other saving grace was it was only about $10 for each. Other than that, a big miss for me.", "author": "Vol T."}

It was a very good sign that all of the dishes weren't sitting in a pool of oil.  The saag paneer was my favorite although I'm not to fond of the cheese.  (It's bf's job to pick those out.)  It was perfectly creamy without feeling heavy.  The aloo gobi, was decent but I wasn't impressed.  Maybe I just don't favor this dish and now I know.  The chicken tikka masala was at first lacking flavor but after stirring it up a bit it tasted better.  The chicken on the other hand seemed cooked ahead of time without being marinated and then mixed into the sauce after being ordered.  It's hard to f-up naan although I've had bad naan before.

Can the first time with several co-workers for a holiday lunch outing. The food shocked me, it is very fresh and very tasty. I can't comment on authenticity, but it tasted fantastic. My favorite is the saang (i think that's it) paneer (spinach paneer). I think I could eat a plate of that and be happy.  They've also got veggie and fish pakora, a veggie dish, full pieces of chicken, a chicken dish, and a few others. The buffet features the same foods, but they do them well and they are worth trying again. \n\nRice pudding is probably the best I've ever had. Loved the chai too.

Veggie curry was good but the vegetables were a bit overcooked, IMHO.

We ended up just eating their lunch buffet which was quite good and inexpensive. We paid $9.95 per person for lunch so that wasn't too bad considering you can stuff yourself silly. I know in one of my reviews that I said Naan-N-Curry is the bomb-diggity but India Clay Oven is a great alternative minus the parking. \n \nSo again, $20 at Naan-N-Curry for 1 plate of Chicken Tikka Masala, 1 Naan, and 2 orders of rice versus $20 for uhm.....EVERYTHING haha. But yea, if you have an appetite for some Indian food this is the place to be. You can check out the pictures to see all the food. I'm not going to go through all of it because they were equally delicious. The only difference is that they cook their rice with peas I believe. So it's like a mix of Chinese fried rice but Indian style haha. \n\nI think the dish that I enjoyed the most was the curry chicken, their fried fish (I believe it was salmon), and their mixed veggies. Normally the Chicken Tikka Masala at most places are dry but here at India Clay Oven, I think they BBQ the chicken then dump it in the curry. It was so moist and tender mMmMm Yummy.\n \nThe layout of the restaurant is pretty nice as well. It's like glass over half of the ceiling so there's a lot of natural sunlight coming in. The only weird part is that the food is in the hallway from where you came in. So you kind of half to walk by the kitchen and the check-in booth to get to the food. I can't really explain but you can always go and see for yourself. A buffet is going to be a buffet so I don't think there's any 5 star buffets in my opinion other than Las Vegas maybe? You can't say no to crab and steaks! Haha. But then again this is an Indian buffet and not Vegas. I don't think they can afford to give unlimited steak or I'd be there with my Tupperware haha (shh i didn't say that.......back to ghetto Chinese roots haha jk)  \n\n[M] The service here is quite efficient. Everyone greets you with a smile. However, service was kind of slow.

I've been here many times, and I've never been disappointed by my experiences. \n\nI usually order the chicken tikka masala, the garlic naan, the chicken tikka kabob, the bengan bhartha, and the lamb biryani. The lamb biryani is my favorite! Also, order the raita and the mango chutney for the naan and complimentary papadums! The chicken tikka masala isn't the best I have ever had, but I always have to order it an any Indian restaurant. The bengan bhartha is very good though, and the chicken tikka kabob is as good as any other restaurant--nothing special. \n\nIf you're in the area, hit this place up!", "author": "Chloe T."}

Why 3 stars? Allow me to show you the numbers:\n\nStaples used to pack the whole order: 6 (I'm always afraid of having to take these off carefully and place them in the trash can before I eat so I don't accidentally ingest them. Aren't there other ways of packing food rather than stapling the heck of out it??)\n\nNumber of samosas in a TWO person appetizer combo: 1. Are we supposed to split it? I guess, pyaar badhtha hai but really??\n\nNumber of containers of chutney for the appetizer combo: 1 (a dinky one at that... I ate like one pakora and it was all gone. The best part about ordering food is then reminiscing about the food later. Subsequent meals should have a tiny magical ingredient left over from the meal you ordered... Like freaking chutney! At the very least, please provide sufficient sides to tide over while two people awkwardly eat the solitary samosa that is part of the combo meant for TWO people.)\n\nNumber of napkins: 0 (I'm eating Indian food. It's eaten with your hands. Please include napkins, even though I appreciate that you're environmentally conscientious. I promise I will recycle or compost as appropriate). \n\nThe food was average, but good for the price. Delivery was quick and friendly.

The tikka masala is delicious, and the rice pudding is out of this universe yo!\nDrinks: mango lassi, instant classic a bit pricy. The chai tea, a wonderful addition to your lunch buffet! if your with your partner, one is enough to satisfy the both of you! it is rich and creamy.\n\nForewarning: Do not force yourself to finish the plate. One plate will be enough to last you the day. You will notice this feeling of saturation right as you stand up to get seconds, therefore seconds usually turn into dessert. Which I say load up on big boy. \n\nNegative:\nIt is kinda really hot in there, wear your cute summer gear, leave the sunblock at home ;) \n\nOtherwise, friendly service.

I try to be fair, and the place could have changed over the years.  Unfortunately, it was worse than I had recalled.\n\nStopped in on a Friday night with some friends.  Firstly, on a weeknight night at prime time, the restaurant was completely empty.  That's not a good sign, is it?  Service was very quick and attentive, but again... it was empty.  Our waiter was just standing around looking at us.\n\nWe ordered quite an assortment of food to share - seekh kabob, tandoori chicken, vegetarian biryani, saag paneer, paneer makhini, assortment of sides (naan, rice, chapati, raita), beverages.  Over $100 for 4 people.\n\nI am a huge fan of Indian food... it's one of my favorite cuisines, and I feel like I will tolerate a very wide range of quality just because I love the stuff so much.  It's hard to go completely wrong.   Yet this was just that - completely wrong.  Everything we were served was incredibly bland.  Despite our requests to have dishes made \"very\" spicy, there was no discernible heat to any of the dishes.  The seasoning tasted salty/black peppery more than anything else.  The paneer in the makhini and saag paneer tasted a little odd, and the lamb had a distinct \"off\" taste - we couldn't even finish it.  Rice and breads were very dry.  There was literally nothing in our meal that would warrant 2 stars, nothing to make me want to try this restaurant again.\n\nI left feeling pretty frustrated at just how bad the food could be at a restaurant with 3.5 stars - I wasn't expecting the meal of my life, just you know... something that wasn't disgusting.  The price tag was also outrageous given the quality of the food. \n\nQuest for good Indian food in the Richmond continues... :(", "author": "Heidi M."}

I may just be the beauty of the land itself. \n\nThe service was friendly and prompt. They have many food options that are kept in these deep clay oven pots rather than as in most buffets you see things under heat lamps that seem stale.\n\nI have to mention that recently I did do a check their inspection score from  http://sf.everyblock.com where it tells you what a business scored on it's health inspection. Theirs was still a good rating but still had some violations that may be a concern to some that may pose a small risk of food born illness. I won't elaborate here but you're more than welcome to read further yourself on the site provided. Hopefully they are working on fixing this. \n\n I would just make sure to check the site every once in a while to get updates before dining at any restaurant. I did notice thought, that not too many yelpers include this type of information or take it into consideration while writing a review of a restaurant. I just hope this will encourage more people to not over look this important detail, as you wouldn't want to end up feeling sick the next day.\n\nAside from this, the food was really great and full of flavor. Nothing tasted stale and was often replenished. And for around $10 bucks for all you can eat, beats out all the buffet chains and sizzlers who don't offer much quality for the price. Oh and try their Mango Lassie. It's like a fermented kefir type drink with mango flavor. Sort of like an Indian version of a smoothie. It was very good.\n\nI will probably go again, but am hoping they will take care of those pending violations soon. That's why I had to mark it down a star.", "author": "Petra S."}

I'm a little surprised at the 4 and 5 star ratings this place is getting, but they mainly seem to be for NON buffet food.  \n\nMost of the meats are overcooked, especially the chicken legs and lamb.  The naan is brought fresh to your table, and while it's good, it's nothing to rave about.  From the lineup, I'd probably say the fried fish was the best.  I guess if I come back, I'd order from the menu.  In the end, it's unfair to expect a lot from a $10 buffet.  I wouldn't recommend the lunch buffet to those who like more traditional quality food?  It's good, but just doesn't seem to have much of flavor profile and comes across a bit \"Americanized\".  Their lunch buffet items could definitely use more love (herbs and spices)!\n\nThe good thing about this place is that there's plenty of space and large rear section for more private seating.  Beware that portions of the hardwood floor in the back area is really bumpy and somewhat dangerous if you aren't watching where you're going.

I was expecting basically Chicken Tikka Masala but with mushrooms....be forewarned....it is nothing like CTM. Its just mushrooms and a lot of onions in a really really oily bland sauce. I ended up stealing CTM sauce from a coworker just to give it some flavor. I now know I was incorrect in assuming the dish would have the same kind of sauce (masala just means mixture) but the dish still tasted really bad and I wouldn't want anyone to make the same incorrect assumption that I did. The rice was ok...kind of dry. Basically the price doesn't match the food. Theres a plethora of better Indian food in town for less so I don't think Id choose to order from here again.\n\nI would've given this place 3 stars because the food wasn't grossly horrible (well the Mushroom Masala was, but the other dishes I tried seemed ok), but I knocked them down 1 star because when they brought us the food there were NO utensils and nothing was labeled. Trying to decipher the different dishes by smell and appearance was no easy task!\n\nUPDATE- apparently the restaurant is saying that the missing utensils was the fault of the delivery service we ordered through. That doesn't really change my rating because the food was delivered late and my Mushroom Masala was pretty inedible and upset my stomach. So there you have it.

In this review, I have included a few notes on Indian cooking, which I find hard to replicate at home.\n\n(note: before my review of Indian food, a moment of silence and prayers go out to the people killed in the terrorist attack in India. Seriously , very sad)\n\nA m\u00e9lange of aromas from various spices permeates through entire space at Clay Oven.  The sixty five seat neighborhood restaurant provides patrons with a tasting menu with their all you can eat lunch buffet (8.95).  Tables dressed in white linen and glass cups set the tone for a charming meal. The high ceiling and wide street side window creates a cozy dining area.  Noticeably, the wait staff is very attentive, constantly refilling beverages and collecting plates.  Once seated, a basket filled with blistered crispy naan starts the meal.  As the name suggests, the menu revolves around char-roasted meat and rich curries.  \n\nStarting my spice excursion, I start with a generous mound of rice pilaf.  Sweetened with sweat green peas, the fluffy basmati rice is flavored with saffron.   Known as one of the most expensive spices, saffron comes from dried stigma of a flower -often used in both coloring and flavoring in Southwest cooking.  With a thick consistency and vibrant green color, the saag paneer which is mild in spice goes very well with the naan.  Eaten both in India and Pakistan, the curry is based on spinach and mustard leaves.  Fried into meteorite -like shapes, the vegetable pakora lacked crispiness and flavor. \n\nSimilar to the Japanese tempura, the vegetable is battered and fried.  Resembling fish 'n chips, the meat from the fish pakora was flaky.  The sweet chutney adds sweet flavor to the otherwise bland fried creations.  \n\nThe tandoori chicken steals the show.  Known as a semi-fried chicken delicacy that originated in the Punjab region, the meat is marinated in yogurt and seasoned with tandoori masala.  While the tandoori masala varies from region to region, the base spice mix includes garlic, ginger, cumin, and cayenne pepper.  Cooked at high temperatures in the clay oven called tandoor, the chicken tastes smoky while the spice adds a sweet aromatic flavor.   \n\nThe curries are exceptional and pair well with the rice.  The chicken curry is a rich intense curry.  Boneless chicken bathes in a red sauce piping with oil and flavored with paprika and chilies.  Tender lamb pieces make up the lamb curry.  For dessert, the kheer (rice pudding) helps cool off the spice while the gulab jumun (brown cottage fried ball) soaks in flavored syrup is offered. \nIndian cuisine is often associated with a sophisticated blend of spices.  \n\nIndia's religious belief and culture plays a very influential role in their culinary arts.  For instance, many worshippers of Hindu and Buddhism are vegetarians.  Clay Oven serves North Indian cuisine and it is differentiate by a high consumption of dishes with dairy products such as milk and yogurt.  Other common ingredients include nuts, saffron, and chilies.     \n\nMany Indian dishes are cooked in ghee, also known as clarified butter.  A spoonful of ghee adds a rich consistency along with a nutty taste.  While cooking Indian food, a well known technique is baghaar with infuses flavor by dropping spices into hot oil.  Cinnamon, mustard seeds, red chilies, and bay leaves are popular ingredients used in this cooking technique.  \n\nMany recipes also require spices to be grinded.  A great example is to taste the difference between ground pepper that has been sitting around compared to the fresh nutty smell of freshly ground pepper.  Instead of adding cream to create a thick sauce, Indian food use yogurt that adds a creamy texture and a dash of tartness.", "author": "Rayfil W."}

Oh! and you would think a nice place like that would update thier dishes!!!! White plates and mugs with gray.silver scratches all over! Looks super old and dingy!!!\n\nI love how all the recent reviews are 1 star!!!! No food quality here!", "author": "arti n."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-06-10", "description": "We eat frequently at Indian buffets and have never had quite as strange an experience. This is a beautiful restaurant but judging from the layout, one never intended to be a buffet. When you first enter and pass the reception counter, you are immediately confronted with a narrow hallway containing the buffet line. After making your way past the buffet and finding a table, you then return to far end of the hallway to get food.\n\nI was at first surprised by the small number of choices, but served myself with what they had before being told that their other selections were in a dark, tiny room across the hall from the buffet line. Actually dark; in that little room we were barely able to tell one dish from another. Had I known about the little room from the beginning, my choices would have been quite different. \n\nThe food was fine: some items better than average; some less so. They don't keep most of the food covered, so several dishes in the hallway that should have been hot were barely warm. If you know anything about food safety, that's a little disquieting. \n\nOur exit from the restaurant was equally strange. We don't usually wait for a check at buffets: leave a tip on the table, and pay the bill on the way out. That nice big reception desk with a manager and a computer seemed the obvious place to pay. Not so. With marked irritation, the manager directed us to yet another tiny cubbyhole used for payment purposes. \n\nRecommendation: If you eat here, see what's in the little dark room before taking any food and when you're done, wait for a check. Or just eat someplace else.", "author": "James V."}

The decor was so classy with white tablecloths, roses at each table, and windows that had the sun shining beautifully through. The buffet isn't just the standard jenky-looking platters sitting under heat lamps, but each food item is kept hot inside big metal cauldrons/pots (so cool). The waiters were also very attentive and were quick to refill your drinks and pick up your used plates. I HIGHLY recommend this place for quality Indian food with unbeatable value, while still maintaining a nice restaurant environment.", "author": "Andrew T."}

The selection rotates a bit, but you generally have a choice of grilled chicken, marinated lamb, chicken curry, salad, basmati rice, and variety of vegetable-based dishes, sides of various chutneys and naan. For dessert they offer coconut ice cream, honey cake balls (not sure of the name), and chai tea.\n\nI like this particular location because it's so bright, and has never been crowded when I've been there. The meal is inexpensive, but the ambiance (cloth napkins, silverware, etc.) makes it a little more formal.

We ordered mixed grill and lamb tikka masala; all lamb was overcooked almost to the point of what you might call \"lamb jerky\", which is a big disappointment because without well-prepared lamb at a place like this, what's left? Yes, garlic naan and masala sauce were good, but that doesn't make up for the shortfall of the main course.\n\n2. Service. This was the most annoying part. I like to eat my food unsupervised, because I no longer need a high chair and a bib. However, the waiter apparently felt the need to constantly pace up and down the aisles and gawk at the tables, with no real purpose at all... other than trying to pick up every empty dish the moment it was no longer needed. What's ironic is that as many times as he approached our table, not once did he ask how we liked the food... bizarre. This was also around 9 pm on a slow Friday night when this kind of zeal was totally unnecessary; by the time we were finished, we were the only patrons in the whole restaurant. \n\nI must say that I have had similar experiences with service at Indian restaurants before, but was reluctant to generalize... but now I'm almost thinking this wasn't a simple coincidence.\n\n3. Ambience. I realize this is an ethnic food restaurant, but I would have liked the music to be turned down lower as in large quantities traditional Indian vocals can get pretty tedious when the music is set to the volume of a normal conversation...", "author": "M B."}

I've been on Yelp for years and use it a lot for finding places, but I slack way off when it comes to writing reviews myself. ICO deserves an awesome review. \n\nI was referred here by the folks at Trad'r Sam's, a bar just a block away. They told me it was \"a bit pricey,\" but I'd rather pay for good food than spend less on crap. \n\nThe look of the place impressed me as soon as I saw it. Dark wood, white tablecloths, red roses on each table, penguin-suited waiters. I did get a tad nervous about the prices at that point, but my fears were allayed as soon as I got the menu. Their prices are exactly what I'm used to paying (and in several cases, a buck or two cheaper). \n\nService was the best I've ever had in any Indian restaurant, hands down. And everything I had was soooo good. I got the onion fritters (they're not listed as pakoras on the menu, but they pretty much are). Coconut chicken curry, one of my favorites -- awesome. It could've used a tad more spice (I ordered it medium), but it certainly wasn't enough to merit the loss of a star. At least the chicken pieces were small and mostly white meat. You know how they are at other restaurants. They brought me a papadum and I ordered garlic naan and rice (yeah, rice doesn't come automatically with entrees). \n\nI went to wash up after dinner & my check was on the table. I cocked an eyebrow at a $2.00 charge for raita I didn't order. Without hesitation, they took it off the check. Oh, and they even gave me complimentary rice pudding for dessert! It was good, but awfully sweet. I couldn't finish it, but I'm still impressed they offered. \n\nThen, after a looooooong ride home to Alameda, I realized I was missing some rings. I knew I had to have left them in the bathroom when I took them off to wash my hands, and I knew they had to be either here or Sam's, so I called ICO and before I could even ask, they said \"you left three rings here. You can pick them up anytime.\" \n\nIt was the cleanest, most professionally-staffed Indian restaurant I've ever been to without a doubt.

It far from impossible to make Indian food without the heavy layer of oil on top, but like most restaurants its not a priority.

The busboy brought out a pappadam with the mango chutney and raita we'd ordered to go with our meal. Then...nothing. The people at the next table came in at 7, ordered by 7:05 and their food was brought to them at 7:20. We hadn't even been brought our appetizer!? We finally asked where our food was as we HAD to leave by 7:35. The waiter was surprised we hadn't been served a-n-y-t-h-I-n-g yet and rushed off. He came back with our samosas which were so-so. We asked him to please bring ALL the food out, whereupon he ASKED US WHAT WE'D ORDERED!!?? He started trying to guess...and guessed WRONG! After half an hour of waiting, we had to repeat our order all over again!! Either he never wrote it down in the first place, or he lost it between our table and the kitchen!? It was apparent our order was never placed. By now we'd run out of town and had to get it to go! \n\nNo effort was made to apologize or make it up to us in any way.

I couldn't remember if I liked it or not, but thought I'd give it a shot to see if they'd deliver to my hood and wouldn't have a minimum of like $30 to get it to me.\n\nI rang them up and the guy was nice.  All I ordered was some rice, chicken tikka masala and garlic naan.  Came out to about $20.  Sweet.  They said it would arrive 30-45 minutes.  Sweet.  \n\nI took a shower, started washing some of my \"delicates\" and what do you know, I hear the door buzzing.  Wha, it's here already????  What do you know, it took them about 30 minutes!  Sweet sauce!!!!\n\nAs I opened my tikka masala, I drooled.  Super creamy sauce ... aww, perfect since I loooooove using naan to soup it up.  Come on, you know you do it too!  And you have to have the right thickness.  It had big pieces of chicken breast (why can't the Chinese places use real chicken breast?).  It looked awesome.  The rice was ok, it was just the basic stuff, but it was going to taste lovely with the tikka masala sauce.  Awwwwwwe yeah.  The garlic naan was pretty rockin' with the bits of garlic slathered on.\n\nI think I inhaled the food, but oh it was satisfying when it was moving about on my taste buds.  I couldn't get enough of it.  I had to control myself not eat the whole thing because I want to have some for lunch tomorrow.\n\nSeriously, this is now my go to Indian craving delivery place for my apartment.

The dining area and restaurant is quite elegant: pretty decor, nice table settings, and a wall of windows in the front with good lighting.

We liked our Fish Tandoori and my brother said his Lamb Kabob was especially tender and tasty, too. I like the Chicken Tikka Masala, but then for some reason this dish seems well prepared almost everywhere I go. My other brother had a yummy looking chicken soup. I liked that they had an iced chai available, too. \n\nAt the end they comped us a couple of dessert rice puddings and I made the mistake of not tasting it until just as we were leaving (we were so full!)...it was delicious and I almost asked to take it to go (but this would've been kind of silly and a lot of extra work and packaging for a little bowl of rice).

So in this case, I just have to say, I enjoyed my dining experience here. I had the buffet lunch, while my wifey and mom ordered off the menu to take advantage of an Entertainment coupon. This is a very pleasant restaurant with skylight windows and murals of Indian scenery and artsy caricatures. If you're a fiend for white table cloths, they got 'em. Full bar... sweet. The servers are friendly, and the service is good. The guy who might be the manager, visits the tables to check on you. Very cool.\n\nIndian curry has a much different flavor than Chinese or even Burmese. Much more kick, and you have the option of how much heat you want on each dish. The lamb is pretty lean, so the flavor isn't as strong as usual. The Tandoori Chicken is roasted with spices, flavorful, but a little dry. It may be better when cooked to order. The creamed spinach type dish is really good, and they have a garbanzo bean dish that's cooked in a very spicy hot tomato sauce that's extremely awesome. I like to put that and some spinach on the garlic naan bread... aw, man! And the naan is served warm, and you do get a variety of seasons to choose from, like garlic. There's also a dish of lamb with flavored rice and nuts that great too.\n\nOK, the prices are moderate and portions are generous.

My wife and our friend had just snuck in 18 holes at Lincoln Park, and by \"snuck\" I mean that we played the 18th in the dark. Seriously, we were aiming at a light on the clubhouse. How we even found our golf balls along the way I will never know. Long story slightly longer... It was foggy, windy, cold, and we were starving. After a conference in the parking lot, we decided to hit Clay Oven. \n\nWhen we got there, there was only one other table occupied (plenty of people came and went for takeout, though). Needless to say, prompt and attentive service was not a problem. My beer arrived quickly, as all beer should. Our order was taken and the Papadams and Vegetable Pakora hit our table within a few minutes. Now, it may have been the freezing round of golf skewing my taste buds, but the dips and the apps tasted fantastic. \n\nOn to the main courses: Chicken Tikka Masala, Mushroom Masala, and Aloo Matter (all medium spicy). Even though we were there late, we were unrushed. The entrees came out a few minutes after we were done with the appetizers. Presentation was very nice and the flavor of the dishes was super. The mushrooms especially. Good amount of spice, not overpowering, so the complexity of my Aloo came through. It was slightly annoying that the waiter came by quite often to ask if everything tasted OK... but by that time we had the place to ourselves, so I can excuse the undivided attention. \n\nService was great. Everyone there was incredibly friendly even though I am sure we were keeping some of them from heading home. Very reasonable on the wallet, everything tasted great. Oh, and the restroom was immaculate. I don't normally point something like that out, but it was exceptionally clean. So, if you ever decide to freeze your ass off for the privilege of chasing a ball all over the damn place... why you'd want to, I have no idea... I mean, it sounded like it would be fun and we did meet a really cute Boxer puppy so that upped the fun factor somewhat... um, anyhow, you could do worse than making Clay Oven your 19th hole.", "author": "Don B."}

The entrees here passed muster in that regard, though honestly I can't say I was floored by any one thing we ate. Starla thought the chicken was a little dry, though what I had tasted fine; Either she just picked an uncommonly dry piece somehow or her chicken standards are higher than mine, probably a little of both. And Pakora is much better when it hasn't been sitting under a buffet heat lamp for 45 minutes, as it turns out.

Two entrees, loads of rice, salad, chai, rice desert pudding thingy, lentil soup.  Mmm mmm good.  I'm still looking forward to the leftovers.  Super nice on the phone, and also excellent when my ladyfriend and I went to dine in.\n\nAll around great service, excellent food, and most certainly my go to spot for the late night grub necessities.

I admit I've gotten some funky-flavored lamb dishes, and occasionally bitten into something that wasn't quite the best part of the chicken.

Reasonably priced dishes, decent enough atmosphere, tasty food (both veggie and meat).\r\n\r\nBy the way, the back room of this place has the nicest bar in the neighborhood, though there's almost never anyone back there.

ANYTHING.  Which may explain why I was unimpressed with this flat, crisp, delicately spiced savory wonder.  Well, wouldn't you feel the same way if you were expecting hearty curry and naan and the first thing they brought you was an Indian version of tortilla chips?\n\nWe ordered take-away and everyone put in their 2 cents on what the British really eat when they have Indian cuisine.  Lamb was voted twice and we ended up with the lamb curry which was good.  The chicken jar-freizie was DELICIOUS.  There is something truely magical and heartwarming when you put spices together with fresh diced tomatoes.  The flavors come together like iron filings drawn to a magnet and in the same way, makes visible the electromagnetic lines that run beautifully proportioned patterns.  \n\nLastly, I wanted something I'd had at other Indian restaurants known as dal saag.  At this locations it's known as palak dal.  Spinach with lentils.  Good and hearty, not too creamy.  Saffron rice anyone?  Yes?  BF's mumma desires it?  Of course.\n  \nAn order of regular naan, 1 cheese naan, and 3 orders of kashmiri naan rounded off the order.  And 6 papadums.  \n\nWait around for 10 mins before getting in the car and heading in to the outer Sunset district.  Well, I didn't go, but my BF relayed how harrowing the experience was because he couldn't turn left on 25th ave and had to drive through the park.  \n\nThe naans were the diameter of basket balls.  I loved it.  The papadum was so good that I had dreams about eating when I woke up the next morning.  They were even good as a snack mid-afternoon, and when I thought no one was looking.\n\nChicken jarfrezie: the sauce made me think about that time, you know, any time when things were wonderous and everything felt alive.  It was so new and yet so comforting that I must have known it in another life.\n\nLamb Curry: I ate it for breakfast, in the shame of the corner of the kitchen, hidden away from all the other sensible adults who had things like granola, fresh fruit and yogurt.  I ate the leftover sauce and enjoyed the sensation of tingly indian spices flowing down my throat.\n\nPalak dal: decent.  Not as good as the other place that calls it dal saag but hey, it was tasty enough for me to have two servings spread on toasted naan, the day after and I still wanted more!  I think it's just something I'm going to have to get over.  Like herpes.  Just KIDDING!\n\nPapadum was fantastic.  I could finally taste all the exquisite complexities that go in to the very flat and crisp disc.  I've developed a fondness for it that resembles my fondness for dental floss.  And believe me, I have a curious attraction to dental floss.\n\nSaffron Rice: it was so popular, there was none left over.  \n\nNever have I had Indian take-away so the experience was compared to in-house \"formal\" dining.  And what I have to say is that we may never eat AT an Indian restaurant again when such good take away is possible.  Just call, place your order and then send off my BF to pick it up.  It's as easy as delivery and he even plates it for me.  What a doll.", "author": "Christina C."}

We asked for everything mild.  Over the years when we dined in and ordered delivery, he slowly turned up the spicy volume on all our dishes.  Needless to say he has been very good to us!!\n\nOur favorite appetizer is the vegetable samosa - fried and shaped like a conehead -- huge!   The soup to try is the Mulligatawny.  Our breads would either be Nan or Onion Kulcha.   The dishes of choice are Hydrabadi Chicken, Chicken Tikka Masala, Kashmiri Kabob, Saag Paneer, Mattar Paneer and Prawn Tandoori.  For dessert, we order the Kheer (rice pudding) or Gulab Jamun (small ball of cake doughnut rolled in sugar and served in a light syrup).  Drinks are the Masala Tea (similar to chai) and Mango Lassi.\n\nTheir all-you-can-eat buffet is a favorite in the neighborhood.  It's usually crowded on weekends, as it is a pretty good deal.

Or any more rice.\n \nIf you want a decent curry at a better price with better service and no shit music, try Raja on the corner of Haight and Fillmore.

Being so far out in the Richmond district I've yet to make the trek to try their lunch buffet. Every time I leave here I'm very impressed with the obvious pride and care that goes into this establishment, it really shows in every detail of the restaurant! \n\nFirst off, the place is immaculately clean. The glasses, utensils and serve-ware are spot free, the linens are bleached, starched and neatly folded, the woods are polished. You can tell they swept, mopped and vacuumed between the lunch and the dinner crowds. Glancing into the kitchen as the waitstaff went about their business I was equally impressed with the order and cleanliness, that stainless steel shined. The health department agrees with me on this, they scored a 100! \n\nThe same couple is always between the lobby, the kitchen and the register, overseeing the operation. They are always polite, friendly and accommodating. When picking up orders for takeout they still offer me a complimentary chai tea while I wait! The waitstaff has also been a pleasure, helpful and efficient, attentive without being obtrusive or pushy. \n\nAnd the food! Tender meats and veggies are cooked to the optimal texture and flavor. I get the impression from many lesser Indian restaurants that flavors and spices are competing for dominance, and are just thrown into the sauces willy-nilly and boiled, but not Clay Oven's. The spices in their tikka, for just one example, are well balanced and complimentary to all the other flavors on the palette, and you can tell it was simmered to creamy perfection! The naan is served still warm and fresh from the oven. \n\nAnother thing I appreciate on the menu are the preset dinners for two. Rather than mulling over what entree you and your date are going to order to compliment each other, why not sample three or four together (with both omnivorous and vegetarian options). Plus, it's actually quite a lot of food for the modest price, enough for dinner and the next day's lunch. \n\nIndia Clay Oven is a restaurant I enthusiastically recommend to my friends. It's a ways out there in the Richmond, but totally worth the trip.", "author": "Brandon S."}

I had good memories of the restaurant from when it was across the street; a tiny little hole in the wall that was nice to find in between the Chinese restaurants and the Jews for Jesus headquarters.  \n\nI have to say the atmosphere is amazing.  It's like you're walking into an Indian 5 Star Hotel.  There is even a registration desk with a really well dressed maitre'd sitting behind the front desk (i can't even call it a counter).  It's all marble and brass fixtures.  That was the good part of my experience. \n\nThe food and service, on the other hand, was not.  While the waiters were extremely nice, they didn't take our order for a loooooong time, and it was a production just to get the tea and wine we ordered.  When we finally ordered and the food did come, it wasn't nearly as tasty as I was hoping.  The Kashmiri lamb was essentially just lamb saag, and it was bland, though the consistency was good.  The fire prawns were overcooked, as well.  The chicken tikka maasala was actually quite good, though, if you don't mind the small portions.\n\nThe Na'an bread, both garlic and plain were also disappointing.  I could barely taste the garlic. And then there was the bill!  Somehow, prices of Indian food jumped dramatically in this city.  This restaurant was a shining example of that. \n\nNot what we call a bang for your buck, or taste buds!", "author": "Adam E."}

I knew I'd like the food becuase I used to frequent Tandoori Mahal down in the north beach/financial district area. \nThe meat selection seemed like it is basically tandoori chicken, chicken tkka-esque chicken, and lamb curry. Not bad! All the meat was tender and flavorful and the naan was pillowy soft.

Indian Clay Oven is a tasty restuarant in the middle Richmond that serves pretty good Indian food in a nice, white table cloth environment. \n\nNow personally, I don't think Indian food should ever be served on white table cloth.  The delicous sauciness of the whole affair, combined with the fact that eating it is a team sport that requires family style food in the middle the gets dumped onto plates on the outside, means that no matter what you do, you leave a big mess.  A mess that is clearly visible because of the dribbles of Massala sauce leading from the center of the table to your plate.  \n\nThat being said, the food was good, a bit pricey by about 15%, but tasty.  It came out in nice little cast metal dishes that made for a good presentation.  The small pots hid the fact, however, that there really was a lot of food there.  Combine that with the garlic naan, which was good by rather greasy, and you're pretty much full after getting through two plate-fulls.  \n\nOverall, it was pretty much a nice, slightly Americanized, Indian meal.  There were some Indians in the place, which is always a good sign, but not many.  If you want to go out for Indian food, but want a place slightly nicer than your run of the mill $10 Indian buffet, try the Clay Oven.  But, if you just want Indian food, save yourself $15 and go to the $10 buffet.", "author": "Eric M."}

I had just run a few errands and wanted something satisfying and good. Sushi, burger, Thai, what should I eat?\n\nI drove down Clement not really sure of stopping any where in particular, but there was a parking spot right in front of the restaurant and I took it as a sign. It was 11 am and wow! look they open at 11 am! So from 11 am - 2:30 pm everyday you can get a buffet Indian lunch that's delicious! And how can you beat $8 for a good quality meal?!\n\nOk, I am really excited about their Naan. Fresh naan is brought out to your table. This is really important! The naan was soft and a little crunchy in the right places. If you go there, you'll know what I'm talking about. It makes your whole Indian food experience so much better when the naan is so hot that you have to wait for it to cool down a little before you tear a piece off to go with your curry or veggie.\n\nWhat did I eat? I almost ate everything they offered on the buffet line. The food is set in pots of food with lids that are uncovered when lunch gets busier, not the regular heating stands that hold tins of food. You grab a semi-clean plate from the beginning of the line, start with rice, then veggie or fish pakora, accompanied by a cilantro type sauce, mango chutney and a tamarind sauce. Then there is the tandoori chicken which was moist and served with grilled onions. This was so good I went back for 2 more pieces. \n\nThere was a lamb curry, with tender bite size pieces of lamb, chicken makhini (delicious, very very good), saag panner (spinach and cheese), dal made of chickpeas, mixed vegetables, salad, raita, two desserts. The saag paneer was just right - a little spicy with good texture. \n\nThe staff are friendly, food is delicious with exceptional naan and a nice setting (skylight windows, floor to ceiling windows, clean and warm) lets me take friends here or just enjoy a nice meal by myself.

It got fairly favorable reviews so we tried it out.\n\nWhile parking, as most places in SF, is dicey and we had to park several blocks away, it was worth the walk. This is a rather charming, nicely lit restaurant with an open, atrium area where the sun comes streaming in when the fog isn't overhead. The lunch buffet is set up just inside the door. We were seated at a table by the atrium, in the sun, with white tablecloths and a rose, in less than 10 seconds.

Saag paneer did not have any taste whatsoever. Chhole masala tasted like raw turmeric. Veg Pakoras were half fried. Carrot halwa was abysmal, stale, dry and tasteless. No daal on the menu. Did not taste the non-veg items, but pretty much rest of it, and it was really really bad. Called chef for a feedback and gave him an earful. I really wanted to know whether he had tasted his preparations and would he still keep them in buffet and expect people to eat. \nI was quite surprised by so many better ratings. It is beyond me, but the food I experienced in my only visit here was very very bad. And my wife felt the same, too.  \nAmbience was good enough and service was okay, not great either.", "author": "Nikhil S."}

My favorite dishes are the paneer makhni, vegetable samosas w/ raita, and garlic naan. What i order is limited because I love these dishes so much, I don't bother trying anything else. The lunch buffet is a great deal and delicious! There are a couple things I would do to perfect a few of the items I order. I prefer raita a little bit thicker than it usually is here. I used to order the vegetable pakora also. It used to consist of larger chunks of vegetables dipped in batter and deep fried, but when I've ordered it more recently, it is mostly just small pieces of spinach in the batter deep fried, so I have stopped ordering this dish. I hate to say anything negative about this place because I love the food here, and very friendly waiters and service. I also love that they play authentic Indian music.", "author": "Sally B."}

A parking place appeared right in front, a sign I thought... since I love Indian food and all things Indian.  I am so glad I went inside.  I was the first person there and the $7.95 buffet lay in wait for me.  I found everything\nexcellent -  okay it wasn't as good as my friend's mother made during my week long stay at their home in Mumbai - but for San Francisco, it was pretty darn good.  I thought the chicken Tandori was succulent and juicy, the lamb curry spiced perfectly and the various other dishes all enticing, with wonderful sauces that I sopped happily with my huge slices of naan.

My roomie and I looked over the menu online first and called my Indian friend to find out what the hell some of the stuff was, because I had never had Indian food before. We finally decided to take the walk down to the Clay Oven to just see what would happen. \n\nWhen we walked pass the window, I was like \"damn, white cloth napkins\" because the woman in my building had said \"it doesn't look like much...\" well I was a little nervous because we are both on a budget, but we went in anyways. \n\nVery nice staff from the start and we were able to order quickly since we had already looked at the menu at home. We ordered the vegetable samasa as an appetizer and when this flat, crackerish bread came out, we were a little confused. We were like \"Is this the samasa? or the nan? what is this? we are so white.\" I guess it was something complimentary because our side salads and the samasa came out shortly after. \n\nMy \"mixed green salad\" was lettuce, cucumber and tomato, while cailin got the cucumber salad. There were some sauces on the table for the samasa so we just continued using them on our salads. We had no idea if they were for teh salads or what, but figured it was ok. I really like the mango sauce and she really liked the yogurt. The cheese nan was really good too.\n\nI got the chicken do piaza and cailin got the vegetable biryani. they looked at me funny since I didn't want rice to go with mine, but I was thinking about all the starches I already ate, I really didn't need the rice, I used the rest of my nan to scoop up the sauce. The chicken was pretty good, but I was hoping it to be a little spicier, the waiter didn't ask how hot we wanted it. the biryani was good too, but again somewhat mild. I guess you have to ask for hot.\n\nWhen the check came, the prices were just in a list so we kind of had to figure out what was what. We couldn't figure out what the additional double listing of $1.50 was, but thought maybe it was the two sauces since the waiter had asked us if we wanted sauces with the appetizer when we ordered. So that was kind of a drag and it turned out to be like $22 with tip, but we both brought some home.\n\nIn the end, it was a fun first experience, but little things like the mild food and extra costs brought down my rating. I will probably go again, but maybe after I try somewhere else first.", "author": "liz c."}

I loved the decor, the view and how clean it was. Our waters were constantly filled but the chai tea tasted too sweet and watered down (it was like drinking a diet version of chai lol) Every time we got up to go get more food...you can't tell from the pictures but it's actually a bit awkward walking back to your table because the tables are too close together. A child at another table almost ran into me when I was walking back to my table. The food was good but, with the limited choices. You would think it'd be easier for them to keep them filled up constantly but the two times, we got up for more food and always ended up \"scraping\" the bottom just to get a lil bit of rice. The bread was fresh and crispy (samosas and garlic naan do not come with the meal - they must be ordered separately.) Overall, it was a good meal and a good price except that I ended up spending more here because I had to pay for samosas. If we had been at Curry Village, the samosas were part of the buffet experience and they just have more variety  there AND I really liked that they also had fruit for dessert. The dessert was limited and there was no fruit. Overall good experience because service was polite and fast. 3 stars", "author": "Rachel A."}

By \"pretty bad\" I mean \"pretty wasted\" and by \"this weekend\" I mean \"the past three years\". Needless to say, by Sunday I was spent. I was done. I was home. Watching movies. And drying out. \n\nAfter just such a \"weekend\", the one thing that makes me feel better is a big, glutonous dinner with friends. So I rounded up Matt capital R and Starla and demanded we stuff ourselves with indian food. Luckily, they are wonderful enablers...er...friends and agreed that indian delicacies should indeed be stuffed into our pieholes. Stat.\n\nI then demand (yes, I can be quite demanding from time to time) that we go directly to Great India. As luck would have it, we couldn't find parking on Geary and as luck would have it, Starla is too lazy to walk that extra block from her crib to get to Great India. Just when Matt and I thought we were going to have to cut a bitch for some parking, Starla suggests we meet at India Clay Oven instead. \n\nStarla is my new hero. India Clay Oven rocks, no RAWKS, my americanized indian food-loving world. I am no fan of the spicy, chunky, or exotically-seasoned indian you're inclined to find at Zante's or, hell, in India. I like the rich, the creamy, the subtle flavors with an intense burst of authentic flavors here and there. ICO is run by the same people who own India Garden on Folsom and it shows. This location has a huge, crisp, clean dining room with dark wood and lots of windows. Real table linens bring this place up a notch from many standard indian joints in the city. Service is fine, if not a touch formal for an indian restsaurant. \nWe had the veg pakora, papudam, veg korma, tandoori chicken, and saag paneer. All of it was perfection, especially the korma and the saag. You will not find any oily messes here. I don't know what their secret is but they somehow manage to keep all the fat blended into the dish, so there aren't pools of still oil floating on top of your food. You know what that means: Second helpings all around.\nWe'll be back but we're taking MUNI next time. Because driving around for hours, looking for parking, in the car-accident vortex that is the Outer Richmond makes me want to cut a bitch.", "author": "Autumn K."}

I'm not a huge Indian fan in the first place because, in my past experiences, you leave reeking of curry and not really remembering anything significant from the meal that is doing its damnedest to follow you around.  However, all it took was one trip to India Clay Oven to change my perspective.  They had everything from tandoori chicken to vegetable masala, and it was all delicious, diverse, and bottomless!!  As a finale, there was a delectable rice pudding along with doughballs swimming in syrup to put the finishing touches on the meal.  The spaciousness of the restaurant, which could easily seat 200 people, prevented the curry from saturating my clothes and the large windows brightened the room with sunshine.  The wood accents were lovely and they had single red roses at every table that complemented the wood while adding a romantic quality.  Quite the lunch special experience at a pleasant restaurant nestled in the Richmond... definitely worth another trip!\n\nUPDATE:  The dinner was fantastic as well!

The lunch buffet is pretty decent, considering the spectrum of food that usually is hiding beneath the covers of chafing dishes at your usual corner curry shop. However, the dinner was much more disappointing.  Here's a handy tip for any indian-restaurant waiters who might be reading: When someone says \"spicy,\" please assume they mean it.  I am *so* tired of having to say \"this isn't spicy enough.\"  Okay?  How many indian restaurants must I train?  I know that my level of preferred spiciness approaches (or exceeds) the \"Professional Driver, Closed Course, Do Not Attempt at Home\" level - but c'mon, *some* amount of heat would be appreciated.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-02-14", "description": "First, it's interesting that it's been one year since I wrote my first review about India Clay Oven.  Now, I'm writing an update to that review!\n\nI just had lunch there on Friday, 2/12/2010, and am impressed by their consistency.\n\nI've been there for their buffet lunch quite a few times over the past month and-a-half now, and early on I noticed a new change:  they have explanatory notecards that describe what's in the dishes that are served up that day.  This is a nice little touch that helps diners old and new alike who like to know what goes into a dish.\n\nNo, we're not talking recipes, but they say that the Chana Masala is spicy garbanzo beans, or that the Saag Paneer is cooked spinach with homemade cheese cubes, you get the drift.  Before, you may have wondered, \"What do they put in these dishes?\"  Not in a bad, pejorative way, just a curiosity about Indian-style cooking.\n\nTheir tandoori chicken is still done quite well and it isn't dry at all, unless it is on the bottom of the pan and the sterno has heated it dry.  In an effort to keep their food warm and moist, they've taken to covering the opening with aluminum foil and leaving enough of an opening so that you can reach the food with the tongs or spoon.  This is especially true of their pakoras, the rice pilav, and the tandoori chicken.  Those do tend to dry out faster from heat and exposure.  The other dishes are in sauces, so they are not covered.  Their green salad is fresh and crisp, not dry and lifeless.  I've yet to see them use any ingredients that aren't fresh or are subpar.  They do a good job with their food preparation, which is VISIBLE, not IMPLIED.\n\nAgain, their service is really good and unobtrusive, and they are family friendly.  I have seen kids (and some babies) in tow and they seem to be okay with the food, too.  In my previous review, I mentioned that their curry isn't too overpowering, and that's held true.  Although, I must say that lately I've experienced a slightly sore throat the day after.  That's probably more me than anything else, so don't knock them for that.\n\nIf you're looking for good Indian/Pakistani food, then you should come here.  It's a much better dining experience.  The other Indian buffet place, Great India, just doesn't cut it.\n\nTheir interior is somewhat gloomy and I don't see many diners in their when I walk past.  Having eaten there before, they do have quite a bit of improving to do if they want to give India Clay Oven a run for its money.", "author": "E L."}

When they moved to their current larger location, we LOVED the new space and continued to patronize them.  Their buffet is an AMAZING bargain--all you can eat for $9--they definitely lose money on us!\nI take ALL my guests here (veggie and meat eater alike) and have never had anyone be disappointed.  \nThey recognize me/us and greet us every time we come, when I order by phone they greet me like an old friend; I literally have no complaints about the food or the customer service.\nI'm a HUGE Indian food fan, too, and have been to every Indian restaurant in SF in my 13 years here, and aside from India Oven in the Haight, this place wipes them all up!\nI'm on my way to India in a week and will have *real* Indian to compare to, but my suspicion is that they are as authentic as they come.\nWhen I told the owner I was going to India, he told me that his entire family is from Rajasthan (where I'll be), so I look forward to the tastes of home while there!\nIf you had a bad experience, give them another chance.\n\nPS.  A few things to note about the food:  it's occasionally QUITE spicy, depending on the chef that day.  In the buffet line, the veggie pakora tray is sometimes only heated by one burner so grab your pakora from the bottom of the tray to assure warmth.  The nan is not like other nan I've tasted--here the consistency is like a cross between a homemade flour tortilla and a pancake (which I LOVE) so if you're looking for a more cracker/crepe style nan, you might be disappointed.  \nAlso, the other 3 restaurants, though owned by the same company, have left me unsatisfied when I've gone.  Somehow, the food is just not as good (though it's easily been 5 years since I've visited any others).\nHope this helps!\n:)", "author": "D C."}

We love indian food and were excited to try a new place. We ordered the lamb saag, chicken vindaloo, dal makhni, and bhindi masala.  Most of the dishes were much too salty which covered up the flavor of the other spices.  The chicken vindaloo was actually very bland.  This is a dish that should be served spicy or spicier.   We also ordered the aloo paratha which never came.  We tried the papadums which were good, but not peppery enough.  And in the end they charged us for more than we ordered.  We pointed out that we had been overcharged, and they apologized and returned us a bill where we were still overcharged but just slightly less.  It was only a few dollars, so we cut our losses and left...never to return.", "author": "Jennie L."}

Last monday, we(party of six) lunched here and it has gone from bad to worse. The lunch buffet used to have plenty vegetarian options, not anymore, just a dal, saag paneer and mixed veg for curries. The saag lacked any salt or oomph, so was the dal and the mixed veg curry. We were not served naan in a quick fashion and had to wave around multiple times to get service. There were only two people serving, the older guy was buried taking phone orders and could not be bothered where as the other one was always inside the kitchen all the time. One of us wanted some pickle and it took them 15-20 mins and multiple reminders to get one, so was additional naan. The worse was the salt lassi we ordered, it was so salty, it was a health hazard. After mentioning this and remaking it, the lassi the second time around was still extremely salty and not possible to be consumed. The lassi was still included in our final bill and we had to point it out to get it removed. All in all mediocre food, sloppy service and indifferent attitude, sad to say but this used to be a good place to get tasty indian food without heading to the southbay or the eastbay.

The windows are so big that the room is always very sunny and cheerful (at least, when it's not foggy, which in the Richmond is a dicey proposition). You can bring visiting family here and not feel embarrassed, which is not something you can say about many other Indian joints in this city.\n\nI've tried pretty much everything, and the highlights are the chicken tikka masala (they call it something else, can't remember), the tandoori chicken, the lamb curry, and that green mushy stuff that I'm guessing is a mixture of spinach and cheese. I'm also fond of the gulab jamun, the donut-like pastries in the syrup.\n\nAs an added bonus, they automatically bring baskets of naan to the table shortly after your arrival, and they'll bring more upon request. It's not the best naan I've ever had, but I think it's very good unless you're unlucky enough to get a burned one.\n\nI've never eaten there for dinner, but looking through the window the ambience seems very nice.\n\nWell worth a visit!", "author": "Sasquatch M."}

The naan was pretty doughy but I'm a big fan of doughy bread so I loved it.  \n  The one thing that threw me off guard was how pushy the waiters were.

I'm tempted to try again, but dine-in, so I can send it back if I have to (I've never sent food back before, and do not relish it, but it was called for in this case).  If they can tone it down to our level they will have some very enthusiastic regular customers.", "author": "Lj\u00f3tur H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-05-05", "description": "In my opinion, this is a fairly good Indian restaurant.  The atmosphere is very nice, the service is quite good and the food is flavorful.  We did have a problem, however, in that my friend ordered her food medium spicy and I ordered mine mild. Once the food arrived and we got into the meal, however, we came to realize that the special requests we each made were obviously mixed up.  I got the spicy version of my entree while my friend got the mild version of hers.  We went ahead and ate them anyway because we were hungry and didn't want to wait for the kitchen to correct the error.  I do have to say the Naan was very good and the Vegetable Samosa was as well.  As for the prices, they are a little steep for Indian food.  Why they--or anybody for that matter--would charge ten bucks for Vegetable Biryani is beyond comprehension. Another thing that bothered me was it felt like the server was encouraging us to over order--after all, two people can only eat so much.  So the bottom line on this restaurant would be it is pretty good but I don't think I would bother going back unless I did so for the lunch buffet and knew they had items on the buffet that weren't super spicy.  From what I hear it is good and I would imagine most of what is on the regular menu is on the lunch buffet for way less dinero.", "author": "Rabbit B."}

So I said \"OK, let's go\" cuz I like Indian food.  We basically found the food was good, but not great... service was ok and overpriced.  I've had better Indian food at a buffet.  I'm a big fan of \"good and cheap\".  This place is not.  Enough said.", "author": "gummy j."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-11-23", "description": "Pretty bland Indian food.  The naan was chewy and they seem to lean on onion with almost every dish.   This place is priced like the better Indian spots around town, but the food is at the bottom of my list regardless of price.", "author": "Andy B."}

I can't get their Punjabi spiced chicken out of my mind.  If you have them deliver be sure to allow yourself an hour wait until they make it but it's much worth the wait.  The staff is nice and they serve your food in the cutes bowls. I haven't found anywhere else as good as this.  I still haven't had the pleasure of going to their lunch buffet but I will soon", "author": "lup b."}

The chicken curry punjabi was spicy and engaging, the vegetable samosas crisp but not greasy, and the eggplant was indeed as advertised by others on this list.  The environment is good, the waiters kind and attentive, and the prices reasonable. We will be back.", "author": "Andrew M."}

Plus the food is good!  I'm not a huge fan of very spicy food, and I found the dishes at India Clay Oven to be a good compromise.  There was a lot of flavor without a lot of mouth-burning agony.", "author": "Corinna R."}
