I was sitting down for dinner, late on a Friday--I live nearby and this is one of the only spots that offer food late. Had never been before. \n\nFive minutes later a woman walked in and joined her friends at the hi top table next to mine--bringing in her large labradoodle. At 1100 at night. In a busy bar. That was serving food. without asking fellow diners if they were cool. My dinner was ruined with a large dog 2 feet from me.\n\nSome people have bad experiences with dogs or animals as a kid.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-11-03", "description": "I have been to The Liberties a few times since moving to Noe Valley for both food and drinks. This review is mostly for food based on my experience last night. I will however say that the cocktails here are good, if not a bit pricy for the atmosphere ($11-$13 a drink). The drink list is pretty big, though, and they have a lot of beer and wine which is more reasonably priced. It's definitely a solid neighborhood spot for any occasion.\n\nAnyways, onto the food! We came in last night for a late dinner after Game 7 of the World Series. Being 10pm on a Wednesday night, there were not that many open options if you didn't want a Burrito or Pizza. Luckily, the kitchen at The Liberties is open until 1 AM every night! The menu is pretty big with appetizers, salads, entrees and pizza, all for reasonable prices. Do note, however, that the menu is different than what is online. It seems like they have added a few items like salads and a few more appetizers and entrees but the prices are relatively the same. \n\nThe Liberties has a special on Wednesday for $3 sliders (Pork, Lamb or Beef) and Whiskey Flights. We both opted for sliders after having drank enough during the game. I personally had a Pork Slider ($3) and Fried Brussels Sprouts with Parmesan, Bacon and Capers ($7) Kosher, right ; ) . My boyfriend had 1 of each type of slider for a total of $9. It took a somewhat long time to get our food (~20-25 minutes) but it was worth it! The sliders were the perfect size and each had their own flavor. Both of us loved the pork sliders because they were well-seasoned and satisfying. Both the lamb and beef sliders were perfectly moist and tasty as well. The brussels sprouts, though, were UNREAL. I usually am not into heavy, greasy food but this may have changed my ways. They were so satisfying, delicious and zesty. My heart may have exploded but I definitely could have had another order.\n\nWe will definitely be back! In addition to the Wednesday specials, they also do Taco and Tequila Tuesdays, Brunch and nice Happy Hour. We are lucky to live near by as I see us coming even more often now that we know the food is good.", "author": "Carrie W."}

It's sort of off the beaten path, so you do not get the ridiculous that goes along with going to bars in the Mission. \n\nEven though you don't generally need to make a reservation, you can easily make one on Open Table and get the points for doing so. \n\nYou can go to The Liberties for brunch, lunch, dinner, or happy hour.  Personally, I love to go on Taco Tuesday. Surprisingly, they make delicious tacos! And on the cheap. Only on Tuesday (and not the rest of the week), they have fish, carne asada, shrimp and I think carnitas tacos, but don't quote me. They are all really good! If you're into bar eats, I also love their tater tots, samosas, and French fries. \n\nThe Liberties also makes a solid yet delightful cocktail. I have had the Clash, the Pink Gun and the Loaded Mule. My boyfriend likes the Pink Gun, but he has the bartender make it in a tumbler with ice, so he can stay secure in his manhood. The Loaded Mule is just a Moscow Mule made with Crabbies alcoholic ginger beer.... Yay girl, yay! \n\nThe Liberties is also a good place to watch sports ball, if you are into that sort of thing. The sports ball crowd here isn't as obnoxious as most. They are a little older and wiser, so no yelling at televisions. \n\nThe bartenders are really nice. The service is solid.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-06-09", "description": "I absolutely love when you have food so good, you have to take to yelp to rave about it. I've ordered from Liberties multiple times but was skeptical of a place that serves such good pulled pork sandwiches AND pizza. So for my first couple of order's I played it safe with the burger, pulled pork sandwiches and delicious sweet potato tater' tots. \n\nBoy was I wrong! \n\nI decided to go out on a limb and wow did it pay off! The bacon, asparagus, and goat cheese pizza is one of the best pies I've had in San Francisco. Now I'm no pizza expert by far but I've had my fare share of delfina-esk pizzaria's peppered throughout the city at $25 a pie and this $16 pizza blew my mind. \n\nNow of course you could say that yes, bacon with  cheese is an easy winner but that's not what set it apart. \n\n#1) As a lactose intolerant person, cheap dairy makes me super sick. Not the case with this pizza.(this pie has goat cheese and (cow) mozzerella too, to clarify) No overwhelming feeling of regret triggered by a grumbling stomach accompanying a stomach ache from hell. Just pleasant overstuffed fullness. \n\n#2) The asparagus was cooked really well, not too chewy but enough of crunch still left to offer something unique, palate wise. The tomatoes halved on top were also a tasty addition. \n\n#3) Now for the real reason I had to write this review. What makes an exceptionally good pie to me at least is the sauce and the crust. As I had already ate half the pie in shear hunger, I began to pick up on the smaller details that you start to discern once your basic hunger is satiated. What happened is that I couldn't stop eating this pizza. I had planned on saving some for \"cold pizza breakfast\" the next morning (Yes I'm one of those weirdos who loves cold pizza, so if this nullifies my opinion's and my existence in general to you, then so be it. *Hair flip*) \n\nI'm such a hard person to please when it comes to sauce and it just hit it out of the ball park. It just tasted so fresh! The sweetness was there but also the spices come subtly through, just fantastic. I think the mistake restaurants make is thinking that people won't be able to taste the difference between quality ingredients. Not true. Once you've had vegetables, fruit, food, ect. from quality sources like Bi-rite, your palate is just never the same. And if they use cheap stuff, well the chef must be spinning safeway shit into bi-rite tasting quality gold in the kicthen. It tasted like the real deal to me. The ratio of sauce to cheese was also very appreciated.\n\n\nTHE CRUST. I could eat just the crust till the end of time. It tasted as if the crust was brushed with olive oil, garlic, salt, and corn meal with a splash of butter too! It's the way I think all crusts should taste like. Also sprinkled throughout the pizza was chili flakes! Just a tad bit of spice in contrast with the sweeter ingredient of the pizza. \n\nAnywho, the food here at minimum seems thought out and well executed. I enjoyed the pleasant pizza surprise and I'll have to actually make it into the physical location one day to see the wizards at work.", "author": "Ulysses X."}

The crust could improve dramatically, as well as the marinara sauce. \n\nSince 2014 The Liberties has undergone a major shift. This used to be a spot where a lot of the neighborhood would come and hangout.  Now on any given night, you will find a very empty bar/dining room, with the ever changing staff hurriedly entering \"Uber Eats\" orders, while the actually in person patrons receive sub par service. Also, replacing quality bar stools, with casino like chairs was a true WTF? move when it happened. \n\nThe staff has changed dramatically. Every time I come in here, there is an entirely new team of servers and bartenders. The Liberties used to be the place where \"everybody knows your name\". For two people who live 1.5 blocks away, it was nice to have staff who knew your name, and your order. \n\nThe food was always \"okay\", but the staff and atmosphere made up for this. \n\nThe owner has decided to focus on things that do not matter, driving away clientele.  \n\nIf you want to improve anything start with the food.

Apparently this restaurant refuses to return your full change because, they \"don't, um, like, carry any change.\"  Wait, what?\n\nI went in tonight to pick up a pizza for takeout (late, no energy to cook, yada).  The waitress handed me the check in one of those restaurant billfold things.  It was 16.31, so I gave the waitress a $20.  She handed back my change, again in the billfold and said \"Thanks, good night\" and walked away.  I opened the bill fold to $3.  I looked at it and thought, 'Huh, she decided to keep the .69 cents as a tip.  That's weird.  She could have told me that.  Funny, cause I probably would have given her a dollar or two as a tip.  But she really should have told me.'  \n\nSo I said, \"Excuse me.  You know, you didn't give me my full change.\"\n\nShe said, \"Yeah.\"  Not the bat of an eye.  \n\nI said, \"You could have told me that. I understand why you probably did it, but you could have told me and not just assumed.\"\n\nShe said, \"I gave you $3.\"  Still, she appears either not to understand or simply not to care.\n\nI said, \"Yeah, but you owed me $3.69.\"\n\nShe said, \"But I gave you $3.  That's just what we do.\"  Huh???\n\nI said, \"You didn't give me my change.  You don't give change?\"\n\nShe said, \"Yeah, that's just what we do.  Cause we don't, um, like, carry change.\"\n\nMind you, I am standing at the bar in front of a cash register.  \n\nI could not have this conversation any longer and I could not have cared less about the 69 cents, so I repeated that she should let customers know, that it was too bad because I would have given her a bigger tip, and left.  \n\nBut, dammit, I had to write this review because there are rules, people!  A restaurant cannot refuse to return change -- or refuse to carry change for some incomprehensible reason -- without losing customers.  Needless to say, I won't go back.  Which is too bad since I live a block away.  But I guess I'm in a boycotting kind of mood these days...\n\nAlso, to be clear, I was a waitress for years and know they live on their tips.  I tip generously.  I also know how you treat customers and you don't steal their money, to their face, with no shame.", "author": "Sara N."}

The pizza dough is comparable to the pizza at 711 while the cheese actually tasted like rubber.

My friends called The Liberties before making the 5-minute walk over and they were able to accommodate us immediately. In fact, they gave us one of the two cozy long, tall tables at the back of the restaurant. The other long table was unoccupied so we felt like we had our own private space. The food was standard brunch fare, and we love the bottomless coffee! I ordered the eggs Benedict, which turned out to be pretty good. \n\nThe only reason I took a star away (well, it was really more like 0.5 star) was because when the server took our order, she told us we could substitute the fries or potatoes for salad or toast, and many of us did. However, only after we've all made our order did she inform us that it would cost an extra $2 for each substitution. (She could have just say from the beginning that \"you can sub x for y for $2\", instead of trying to be all helpful and then later made us feel like she pulled one over on us.

Thankfully, with only five per order, split between two people, disaster was averted...this time!!!  Next time, someone may have to say a prayer for our souls, as we may ask for a double order....\n\nThe Bangers & Mash were delish, and at $14 for THREE (!!!) tasty sausages, lots of mashed potatoes, and oodles of grilled onions, it was a great deal for only $14, since it gave me enough leftovers for a whole other meal!  My only complaint was that maybe this dish was overly-drenched in pan gravy...so next time I'll probably just ask them to go light on the gravy!\n\nMy partner got the Fish & Chips...Overall he was pleased, but complained that the fries were soggy.  This is undoubtedly NOT the restaurant's fault, because this is a common issue with take-away orders...by the time you get them home and the containers opened up, the steam from the hot food has left your fries waterlogged!

They have a great range of food but I highly recommend the Mission Burger, one of the best in the Mission in my opinion. Great place to catch sports games too which is why I usually end up there. The staff is great but I have to call out Ashley who works as a waitress and has been my bartender once, she couldn't be nicer or more accommodating every time I've been there! The other staff has been great as well but my friends and I try to get into Ashley's section if she's working. Great place, definitely 5 stars for their service, food, sports and being a nice low key place to go to in the Mission since it's off the beaten path of Mission Ave or Valencia St. \n\nAnd the best part...

My biggest pet peeve is slow service-am I the type to summon your manager? Yeah, I am. But I wasn't in an uppity mood to do so-so I begrudgingly carried on.

Not everyone can execute cooking it correctly, let alone seasoning it properly and I must say they were delicious. Juicy and seasoned very well.

You want an entry into best french fries of San Francisco--this is the place.  Kennebec fries were awesome--the waitress claims the restaurant cuts it themselves.  They are the size of a pinky finger and have a little potato skin on the ends.  Just like Picadilly Fish and Chips, but way fresher oil and potatoes.  The home fries and croquettes (all from the french fry family sort of) were all excellent as well.\n\nMy burger, pretty good--solid.  The beer on tap--cooold and good.  The English Pub brunch plate--not bad as well--all very good.\n\nI've driven by this place a million times, but only went because of a blackboard eats promo.  I was worried about the wait given prior reviews.  But since about three months ago, the waitress claims, they hired a second wait staff person (her) specifically in response to the yelp reviews.  We waited less than 15 minutes for our food on a Sunday at 1 pm.  \n\nWe sat outside and brunched.  Others had $12 pitchers of mimosas.

My concern was that it was a Friday night 8:30. I decided the best plan of action was just to start walking and see where I ended up. And that plan worked to my advantage.\n\nI've walked, or been walked depending on one's perspective, by The Liberties more times than I care to think about and never once stopped by. Why? I have no reason except to say that I get stuck in my food ruts. They were, of course, busy, but they were more than happy to find me a seat. Thank you!\n\nAs it was coming up at midnight East Coast time, I didn't want anything too heavy though the bangers and mash sounded good. I decided to go with their grilled cheese sandwich, a bowl of tomato soup, and an order of tater tots. Oh of course I ordered a tequila and tonic. My new favorite cocktail, for those not in the know, but I digress, back to the food.\n\nThe tater tots were cooked to perfection. The tots were golden brown and crisp on the outside and soft and tender on the inside and served with a side of chipotle mayo, which was spicy and warm and just matched the tots in perfection. The grilled cheese sandwich on sourdough bread was again golden and crisp on the outside, and oh so cheesy on the inside. To add more yummy in my tummy, the tomato soup was thick without being chunky. Topped with parsley and croutons. It was the absolute perfect meal. \n\nOh and their cocktails, at least my tequila and tonic was top notch.\n\nIf you're at the edge of the Mission and hungry for some great pub food, The Liberties is the place to go. From the friendly service to the great food and drinks, you won't find a better place in the surrounding blocks.\n\nMy rating...3.5 Paws\n\nWith love from my dog bowl to yours....Happy eating.\nShatasdogbowl.", "author": "DJ S."}

So you'd think the owners would take steps to encourage and cater to locals.  This includes locals that go there to watch football games.  There are a lot of places to watch the games, and this place is no longer one of them. I will not go to this place to watch games again.

I watched her be rude to customers and even saw her YELL at a patron who had a table full of food and beer for him and his soon to arrive companion about saving a seat when the place was EMPTY. That is not how you treat customers, actually it's not how you should treat people. I would like to note I observed this behavior on more than one game day so it wasn't a one time fluke.\n\nI will say the food was up a notch from last time.  I want to like this place.

Made a reservation for 10 people so they sat us in the loft/booth area across from the door so our rowdiness wouldn't bother other patrons in the restaurant!\n\nThe waitress was attentive and nice, and quickly took our drink orders.  I like how we were given large glass bottles of water so we didn't have to wait for water refills!\n\nFor drinks, I tried Liberties Summer Lemonade, and it tasted like real lemonade!  Yes, there might not have been that much alcohol in it, but the lemon wedge and the sugar rimmed glass made the drink soooo delicious and refreshing!\n\nTheir Irish Coffee was a little strong... Even though it's an \"ice cream\" drink, the coffee was still hot.  However, the hot and cold sensation was interesting and the Jameson was... helpful.\n\nAnother drink that looked really good was their Raspberry Mint Gimlet - I really wanted to try it but didn't get a chance to.  It has raspberry puree in it!  It seemed like a perfect summer cocktail :)\n\nFor appetizers, we ordered sweet potato fries, calamari, and rosemary garlic fries.  Their rosemary garlic fries were so good!  Really hot, but the fries (they're more like steak fries - thick and hearty!) were really fragrant and the herbs just made the fries really tasty!  I also like their sweet potato fries as well, but they were a bit - standard, just like the calamari.  Great appetizers nonetheless!\n\nI had Curried Samosa, and it came with a little salad.  Wow, it was REALLY good!  I had dinner prior to coming here but I still finished all of my food!  The samosas had Irish bacon, pudding and curried mashed potatoes in them.  It was fried to perfection - golden brown and super crispy, and really crunchy was I cut open the samosa.  The curried potatoes inside were a little spicy, however, the cool mint cilantro dip it came with really balanced out the heat!  The salad was fresh and came with light dressing, which I loved because I don't like my veggies drenched and soggy!\n\nI tried my friend's cottage pie - next time I come, I will get this!  It has the perfect blend of ground beef AND ground lamb, and the lamby flavor was not overpowering at all!  Eating it almost made me feel like I'm in a barn with sheep baa'ing next to me!  I also loved the slightly baked mashed potatoes on top of the meat pie - so creamy yet slightly browned, making it a little crispy, definitely added texture!  It also came with a side salad!\n\nI also tried a little bit (yes, I was picking at other people's food alllll night) of their chicken curry with rice.  It was pretty standard.  I do like that they used long grain rice, so it's not all mushy - since curry tends to do that to rice!\n\nAt the end of the night, they were really courteous to let us sort of \"split up\" the payments - people could pay with separate credit cards - just let the waitress know how much to put on each card.  I thank them for doing that for such a large party!!\n\nOne thing to be aware of is that they have a small kitchen, so your food/drinks might take a little longer to arrive (they also state that on their menu!), but we didn't wait too long at all!  Our food arrived unexpectedly fast despite their little disclaimer :)\n\nThe food is reasonably priced, and I will definitely come back and try some more of their Irish dishes - I can't wait till my next visit!", "author": "Peggy S."}

Sure, but they're status quo with what you'd come to expect at any watering hole.\n\nIs it because they have some of the friendliest employees on the planet?

The kind of place that will remember your name, your favorite drink, and even be there to talk about life's little mysteries that only your neighborhood barkeep can shed light on to make sense of it for you. That's not to say that you should roll in there and dump your drama on their front stoop, but I'm willing to bet they'd hear you out and even try to offer some words of wisdom in your desperate time of need.\n\nIt's not just the people, though, as they serve some top notch pub grub that completely exceeds the usual menu items like nachos and dang quesadillas http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUoyioYEggU&feature=related. In fact, I'd argue that they might have some of the best bar bites in the immediate proximity.

Then the other hostess said they started to sell sweet potato fries.\n\nWhen she said that, everything went into slow motion. It was like a scene from The Matrix. Then she said, \"we have the best sweet potato fries.\" I almost fainted out of laughter. Did she just say that?

She said the Chipotle sauce was the best. So being the open-minded person that I am, I tried the fries. I felt like I was stabbing Zebulon in the back but really, I was only trying to prove a point. The point was, no one has anything on Zebulon SPF!!!\n\nStill the BEST SPF in the Bay!! The fries were all right but it lacked something. The \"best sauce\" tasted like a Chipotle/mayo mixed. The shake, came in a martini glass. It was $11 for a gulp! I would have gone to Burger Bar and spent $8 on a shake than the alcoholic shake I had here.\n\nI was so bummed for the SPF and mad that I was lied to that I ate my other half of my Ike's sandwich. I needed something delicious to down the so-called best SPF with. \n\nWhen the hostess came to give us our bill, she saw that we were eating our sandwiches and said, \"you guys are tricky with your sandwiches!\" I wanted to say, \"well, that's what you get for lying to us about having the best SPF!\"\n\nI'm not mad at the hostess because she just didn't know any better.

I also recommend the mini sliders - the lamb and pork ones are awesome - and the chicken satay salad is a good healthy alternative. \n\n\nSo yeah, I guess I love this place because they serve food until REALLY REALLY late, the food is good quality and there are some interesting specials.\n\nKeep the Yelp deals coming!", "author": "E-dough R."}

While waiting for my food to be prepared I saw one of the cooks drop an english muffin on the floor mat (the ones they hose off out on the sidewalk to clean) then pick it back up and put it in the toaster. I politely informed the waitress and she had the cook throw it out and make a new one.....in the same toaster. Sorry but this is not good enough. We left. I won't be back. This is simply unsanitary and disgusting. Those mats are black with grease and dirt and I've seen them hose them off outside on the filthy sidewalk. The same sidewalk that often has vomit, fecal matter, and all manner of mission grossness. I'm appalled. \nTHis place has been very hit or miss over the last 7 years that I've lived here and this is really my last straw. The waitress was very sweet, she always is.

The food is a tasty spin on bar food - super delish samosas, beef sliders, and I *loved* the scotch eggs (they are pretty much breaded up, deep fried eggs. *gorgeous* I know!). Nothing fancy, but everything was really well balanced spice wise...like everything you want in bar food (in other words, its good even before you get tanked!)\n\nDrinks ain't too shabby either - you've got your obligatory Guniness and yadda yadda, but they do make some tastiness known as the Ginger Mule. You. Must. Get one. It tastes like a spin on a whiskey giner but a lot more refreshing. So delish.\n\nService peeps are nice, and are cool to chit chat with over the bar.

The beet salad isn't something I'd ever order off a menu, as I'm not totally crazy about beets, but the ladies at the table next to ours had a couple and they looked awesome.  Dark greens (I really don't think you can call it a salad if it's made with iceberg lettuce), beets, grapefruit, nuts - yum yum yum.  Totally delicious.  Really nicely dressed.  And then my fish and chips - totally awesome.  A little on the pricey side at $15 or $16 for fish and chips, but three giant pieces of fish and a whole ton of fries?  Yes please.  I should note that we'd also gotten some sweet potato fries earlier in the evening and they were ridiculously good.  Ohhhh man, I loveeee sweet potato fries.

This is why it is a shame.\n\nWhy you may ask, dear Yelpers?  Well, for one, the last time I went (the weekend of June 24th, for brunch), I ordered the crab cake benedict.  Now, I have to have eggs benedict whenever I dine on the weekends.  I was surprised to discover that one of my components of this delight was missing: The English muffin.\n\nNOW, that said, were we banning English muffins that day?  Have the Catholics really \"had it up to here\" with the Protestants that my English muffin had been discarded like IRA weaponry and materiel?  Well, I asked the waiter just that.  Nary an apology was to be found from his Anglican lips.\n\nHe said that he'd find out what happened.  30 minutes later, and no muffin to be found, nor the waiter, we paid our bill and left an equivalent tip to the waiter's reaction.\n\nThe Liberties is a love hate relationship of sorts.\n\nSometimes you can go in there and have a killer meal.  The next time you arrive, the meal may kill you (such as the raw chicken presented to my roommate).  It's Irish roulette presented in a faux-Irish setting.\n\nAlthough I do have to admit, the mixed drinks are really good.\n\nLong and short--if you're going to drink, this may be the place for you.  If you're going to eat, hold on to that roulette wheel tight.  If the food and service were to improve (such as actually hunting down that English muffin and bringing it to the table, no matter how late, that would have made a world of difference--like the waiter cared a LITTLE bit), I may be capable of increasing my rating. \n\nHowever, given the track record there, nary a new star will be seen on this posting.", "author": "David S."}

But if you feel like having a beer with some friends and watching the game - it's your place!\n\nI was really surprised to see that they have a late night menu AND a student menu.  Big plus in my book.  I went in there for a bagel and a hot toddy during the late afternoon one day and both the food and drink tasted kind of funny.  I think I'll be ordering something else next time.  The upside to being there in the afternoon was that it was almost empty except for the wait staff and one or two patrons.  \n\nI look forward to eating outside for breakfast some morning soon, or maybe going in for an item off of their late night menu.\n\nTo sum up: the food is good, but not great.  They have a decent selection of items and a nice place to sit outside.  The restaurant is a little chilly, so bring a coat.  If you like sports, seat yourself at the bar, grab a drink and enjoy!\n\n**Edited**\nWe ate outside this weekend and learned that, in order to get an alcoholic beverage while seated outdoors, you need to order food.\nAlso, some of the tables are pretty wobbly, so make sure you you have something to put under the legs!", "author": "Heather S."}

They serve food late, there's always people sitting at the bar meditating over a pint and some good conversation, and the tvs play sports mutedly above the bar.  There's a good selection of beers on tap, and the girls behind the bar can make a pretty decent martini.\nMy favorite thing about The Liberties though, is brunch.  The best Bloody Mary I have found in the Mission (although I haven't yet sampled the infamous Zeitgeist version), and a menu boasting a full Irish breakfast (complete with Heinz baked beans - so good) and my favorite, the boxty potato pancake with smoked salmon and sour cream.\nMy boyfriend and I came here on one of our first dates and make it back a couple times a month and it's consistently great.", "author": "Jane F."}

My boyfriend and I went to have breakfast at the Liberties Bar and Restaurant and were expecting some phenomenal drinks and food but boy were we mistaken.  First of all the Spicy Bloody Mary taste awful.  It is made with Kettle One and basically tomato juice.  No flavor.  And no alcohol taste.  My boyfriend who I have to say really never complains actually spoke up about his food.  He ordered the Irish Breakfast which consisted of; eggs, blood pudding, sausage, beans, and potatoes.  The cost of the place was $11.95.  The eggs were raw in the middle, the beans were canned and disgusting, blood pudding was worth while, and the sausage was not Irish sausage at all.  More like cheap Farmer Johns.  The Irish bacon was just a piece if regular bacon.  The potatoes were red potatoes with a few green onions.  Terrible.  No bread.  My boyfriend is 5th generation native Irish San Franciscan and has lived in this area his whole life, he now knows why he has never came to this place for breakfast or brunch.\nLets get to my order: THE CORNED BEEF HASH and eggs.  Basically canned corned beef with flavorless potatoes and one egg.  For the price of $8.95.  The menu stated it came with a spicy horseradish sauce which was just plain cocktail sauce.  HMMMMMMMM.  Not at all good.  I was really shocked that this facility would be serving canned items.\n    I do not blame that Latino cooks in the kitchen, for the lack of poor food.  I blame the owners who allow such crappy food to go out.  The bill came to $43.00.

We decided upon The Liberties on Guerrero because it wasn't nearly as crowded as The Lone Palm. Or at least that's what Jason claimed. I think he merely sensed action at the Liberties. I arrived to find him seated at a table, my red wine already waiting for me. As I sat down, he leaned in and said, \"I think there was almost a fight.\"\n\"No shit? Between who?\" \nJason explained that when he arrived and ordered our drinks, a gentleman at the bar began chatting Jason up and introduced himself as \"Reggie.\" Apparently, Reggie had just exchanged less than kind words with a white-trash looking fellow wearing a construction company t-shirt and basketball shorts. White trash was accompanied by another hooligan and 2 scantily clad young ladies who fashion themselves the poor man's Paris and Nicky Hilton. In Reggie's corner was his brother, a flawlessly dressed fellow who bore a striking resemblance to Mos Def, right down to the pashmina, hat and designer trench coat. \nJason and I got to talking about bar fights, Jason's biggest brawl being when he pulled an drunk Asian lady off his fraternity brother. The whole time we're talking, Jason keeps looking at white trash, going \"I know that guy. I swear I know that guy.\" \nFinally, it hits him. \"It's Kenny! It's Kenny. I know him. I hired him for a kitchen remodel! Oh my god, I totally know him. That's Kenny. He's a complete asshole.\"\nIt is literally exactly at this point that Reggie and Kenny dive at each other, the melee working itself to the back of the bar and behind some wall. A crowd forms as Jason and I crane our necks to catch every inch of this fabulous fracas. Suddenly, Reggie, as if on a Slip N' Slide, flies spread eagle on his belly from behind the wall until he lands under the bar. Mos Def enthusiastically joins the rumble as Kenny's dates remain blissfully oblivious at the other end of the room, deep in a conversation about flavored lip gloss or Lindsey Lohan's bangs. \n\nIt was a decent fight, involving lots of screaming Irish women, people running back and forth through the bar and grunted unintelligible expletives. In all honesty, bar fights make me nervous. I'm convinced that someone will suddenly break a barstool over my head or find a way to drag me into the action I want nothing to do with. But Kenny and his crew where kicked out, the bar erupting into thunderous applause as they left. \nI went to get more drinks as Jason got the scoop from a gal named Sarah who seemed to know the gory details of the dispute.

Then I realized over time that the food just wasn't getting better and the portions were generally small. The clincher was recently when we had to wait about 45 minutes for a simple brunch order to be served even though there were only three other tables seated at the time. After half an hour bread was brought to the table, but we had to ask time and time again for refills on the drinks. No discounts were given on the tab and nothing was offered as a gesture of good will for the abysmal service. I am sure that it remains a great place for brew and chat, but I would stay away from the dining.\n\nUpdate: after staying away for a few years because of the above-stated bad experiences, we decided to give it another try. We sat outside as it was a pleasant autumn evening. That was the first mistake. The intersection of Guerrero and 22nd is a disaster: cars honking at each other like crazy, people screaming, cars almost running over pedestrians, etc. Then there are all the smokers who sit outside. And I mean a lot of them! The restaurant was busy inside, and it appeared that they were understaffed. Our waitress took a long time to bring our drinks. The food took much longer. Then she brought the wrong entree for me. Which resulted in another 20 minute wait. The dish I had was plain and not very substantial. The accompanying salad was just greens with a few drops of salad dressing. To her credit, the waitress comped us our soft drinks because of the long waits.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-08-02", "description": "The Liberties seems to be forever trapped in some kind of ongoing identity crisis.  When the place first opened, it seemed to be a restaurant with a bar added as an afterthought.  Later on it felt like a neighborhood pub with a dining area.  On my last visit, a non-green paint scheme and a subdued sound system playing predominantly ambient music gave me the impression that management was chasing the current trend of restaurant-lounge chic that's sweeping the Mission like an outbreak of chicken pox in a classroom full of second-graders.\r\n\r\nEarth-tone walls, hardwood floors, and minimal use of decor create a nice space with a clean look.  Large windows facing Guerrero street make for a pleasant daytime vibe, and while a small amount of brewery-sponsored wall clutter is present, it doesn't dominate to the point of being overwhelming. The predominantly ambient music doesn't sit well  with an Irish Pub environment, but on the other hand it's conversation-friendly volume level is better suited to it's restaurant side.  TVs are oddly placed...and equally split between American and European sports.  The array of on-tap beer is good for this neighborhood and the liquor selection is better than average, but never having eaten here I can't vouch for the food.  As for the crowd, it's hard to draw a bead on. It was pretty lively during it's pub-with-grub phase, but it's gotten *much* quieter since entering it's present restaurant-lounge incarnation.  The crowd is usually a bit older and more sedate than you'll find further down 22nd Street, and the ratio of bar stools-to-patrons is noticeably higher.  \r\n\r\nBut an Irish Bar?  At the time of this review, it's status as such is debatable at best.   At the moment, you could change minimal elements of the decor and call the place English, Scottish, Welsh, or Italian with new patrons being none the wiser.  But if you're looking for a nice space rather than an Irish one, it's  worth checking out if you're in the mood to hide-out with someone special, and The Lone Palm across Guerrero street is a bit on the crowded side.", "author": "Mike W."}

This place is great as far as friendliness and inexpensive drinks, but the food is...well...it's crap.  A friend reserved the room in the back(great little space) for a bachelorette kick-off party complete with \"passed\" hors d'ouevres....at $16 per head~ it was a disgrace.  Not only was everything brown, deep fried and dumped on a platter, but their idea of passed was the waitress(who was great by the way) walking past the guests and plopping it on the table.  \r\nI saw the menu the hostess chose from and I'm not sure when pigs in a blanket became a substitute for a salmon avocado roll with lemon grass dipping sauce, but there was nothing even resembling salmon, avocado or anything with the slightest bit of lemon or grass...we would have welcomed the color of either.  \r\nI tend to be a bit critical when it comes to food because it's my job, but the menu choices weren't honored and the way the food was to be presented was completely misleading.  In this case my disappointment is more than justified.  As for the price , they should be ashamed of themselves....we should have ordered fish and chips for $6 a plate and called it a night. \r\nHave a pint, hang out, chat with friends, reserve the back room even...just have a burrito down the street beforehand and call someone else to cater your events;)", "author": "Carrie P."}

Irish Pub my ass, this place would know Irish if you smacked it with a Guinness. Even the clientle leaves a lot to be desired. No disrespect intended to the people who gave it high marks, maybe I need to go when you are there. The first thing that annoyed me was when we ordered our first round, the waitress brought the drinks by and the bill. She stood there and WAITED for us to settle up immediately. She didn't ask us if we were ordering more drinks, just brought us the bill. That kind of behavior warrants a negative star. I didn't see this happen to anyone else, but in all honesty I wasn't paying that much attention. I ordered an Irish coffee, I asked for a spoon and sugar. Of course, I had to wait until the tab was settled until this arrived. Waitress, gets he spoon, I reach for it, hand open, palm up, she places it on the table. You probably don't know, but I am a minor germ-a-phobe. I am also big on manners. I say, I don't want the spoon placed on the table and ask for another one. Same thing happens. This time, I stop all conversation at the table, when I tell the bitch, that I don't want my spoon placed on the table. My friends blink, because I normally don't express this level of demand and anger. Bitch you see my hand open, right? She gets another spoon, hands it to me, I no longer look at her. She stands there and repeats a few times that there is already sugar in the Irish coffee. I ignore her. Bitch, I know there is sugar in the Irish coffee.

Ok, I must admit, I went there hoping to score some dinner. BIG MISTAKE. I guess one should really limit one's expectations of an Irish pub to that which they do best: dispense copious amounts of alcohol. Still, my friend and I wanted a quick bite before heading to a movie and, living only a few blocks away, this seemed like an ok choice. I will preface this by saying that it was the day after St. Patricks day, so I suppose it's possible that the regular staff was taking a much needed day off after dealing with the frat boy invasion that I'm sure must have occured the previous night. Still, WHERE did they find their replacements? The closest sorority house? Another planet? No, really, I'm  not usually a mean person but PLEASE, the waitress had to be the dumbest individual I've ever encountered. Brief recap: 20 minutes to get our water (there were maybe 3 other tables at most). After asking for it twice, we finally went to the bar to get our own water and the waitress, seeing us do this, proceeds to go pour more water and bring it over to us (pretending to remember). Then, another 20 minutes pass and, still, no salad, no burger.  When we ask her if the food is coming out soon (since we were trying to make a movie), she seemed dazed & out of it) and replied \"maybe\". Uh, ok? Couldja check? She was too busy bopping around  The salad finally came out a good 10 minutes later--50 minutes after we ordered!! And, guess what?! Yep, she got it wrong! We didn't stick around to see if the burger came out right. We told the bartender we were leaving & went somewhere else. And, of course, missed the movie.", "author": "SL N."}

There's four of us, only 2 other guys in the bar, we order 4 irish brekkies, and tea \"oh it doesnt come with beans? they're extra... hmmm ok, oh and mushroom is extra too, oh, right, well we'll have them anyway...............\"  \"excuse me? we didnt get our tea yet\" (15mins later). Out comes breakfast after about half an hour, \"excuse me, i didnt get my toast\", out comes the cold toast, \"oh and he's still waiting for his 'side' of beans\", oh here they come, wtf, they're cold????!!!! \"Excuse me, bartender, this guy here is still waiting 4 his tea! CHECK PLEASE! HOW MUCH! Are you guys serious?\" Honest to god, between all the extra's they charges us it was like $75 EACH for breakfast!! WTF!!!!
