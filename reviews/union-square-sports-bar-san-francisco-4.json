Sometimes they're a little slow to clean so just ask the people around if a table with crap on it has been empty for awhile. \n\nOtherwise, a chill bar with no pretense that's great to watch the games at.", "author": "Will X."}

Peter L and I walked in on Friday, May 18th around 9:15pm. We managed to find two seats at the bar.\n\nI'd been drinking everything under the sun the last three stops (beer, shot, wine, cocktails, etc), so I wanted to keep it chill. Just got a beer. I have no idea which beer, but I think I may have seen a light beer on draft and just picked that? (I've been feeling a little fluffy lately.) I believe Peter ended up with a jameson and ginger. Both drinks were fine. Standard for this type of bar.\n\nThe atmosphere itself is just your typical sports bar. Dark with TVs. There wasn't a game going on while we were here (at least I don't think there was), so it was pretty laid back that night. Peter and I were able to talk and slowly enjoy our drinks. The bartender was nice and attentive. Though we only stayed for one round, so we didn't really ask for much during the hour plus we were here.\n\nLots of TVs so a good option for catching a game.", "author": "Elena N."}

Whoop!\n\nAnyway, it's a nice, relatively small, neighborhood sports bar, just where the FiDi starts getting seedy (it's probably technically in Tenderloin, but I'm not an expert on such things). Unfortunately, they opened on Saturday two hours later than their sign said they did. Anyway, good beer selection and pretty good bloody mary. The bartender (her first day, on loan from a bar nearby that was closed for renovation) was quick to switch not one but two TVs to the SEC channel for me (granted there was only one other guy there), but still, I appreciate that. Service was good and fast and the beer was cold, and the TVs all worked. That's about all you can ask of a sports bar.\n\nThey put on the Real Madrid game for one other guy there, so (early at least) they are happy to accommodate fans when possible.\n\nI have no idea what it's like at USSB when it's crowded, so you are on your own with that.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-08-15", "description": "I could follow the lead of others and label the Union Square Sports Bar a trendy hub of testosterone with mediocre drinks and service. Or, as one reviewer oddly describes it, a \"predominately strange male environment.\" But that would be too easy. Sure, this isn't the standout in a neighborhood that is packed full of super unique bars with incredible cocktails, but what they do they do right, and that will keep me coming back. \n\nThat \"male environment\" is most likely due to the 20+ flat screens that adorn the walls showing every sport imaginable. As the name so subtly implies, this is a sports bar. It's actually refreshing to find a sports bar near your hotel when the only other options in five square blocks are high-end cocktail bars or dives you could easily get shanked in. The service and the drinks aren't anything exceptional, but they do the trick when your main goal is to belly-up, grab a buzz and watch the game for a couple hours. \n\nThis may not be everyone's cup of tea, and that is understandable. If you are looking for someplace comfortable and welcoming to escape, have a drink and take in a sport or two, this should be high on your list.", "author": "Alex L."}

No food here, so don't come hungry. The doors were open the day that I was there on a 52 degree day. Quite cold inside. I would stop by for another beer, but it's difficult to make it a long stay kind of place.", "author": "J P."}

The bartenders and bouncer are friendly, particularly times when it's quiet. The beer and alcohol selection is normal for San Francisco, but if you come from anywhere else you might be amazed at all the microbrews.\n\nJust a pleasant, unpretentious place where you might bring a friend, a non-fancy date, personally I just go there and surf the net on my computer after work.

And I personally liked the fact they have pool tables. In addition, they do have a plethora of TVs. So you can at least be sure that you'll be able to watch whatever it is you want to watch.\n\nTo improve, they really need to improve their food selection and quality.

They are polite and attentive, even under pressure, and, as is the case with any bar, if you treat them well they will go out of their way to make sure you are comfortable.\n\nSure, the place is kind of a dive.

What a perfect spot for the BFs/husbands to flock to while the GFs/wives go shopping! \n\nU.S.S.B. is your perfect sports bar. There are sooo many TVs here, making it extremely easy to watch a handful of games at a time. Due to my over-consumption of alcohol, I do not remember exactly, but I know there were definitely over 10 TVs mounted on walls throughout the bar. U.S.S.B. is appealing because it is not trashy, not ghetto, not dangerous and not too touristy. There are 2 pool tables in the back along with darts. \n\nI came here last week to celebrate Cal's victory against OSU (Go Golden Bears!) and to watch the 2nd half of the Stanford v. Oregon game.

There were plenty of cheap beers and a few craft type beers to choose from.  I believe they also had a selection of bottled beers to choose from.  There's a full bar also with all your liquor selections.  The prices on everything was affordable compared to the bar you'll find in your hotel or in the nicer full service restaurants in town.\n\nThe most important feature was the many many TV's they had available to watch all sorts of sports on.  The whole area above the bar is lined with TV's as is the area around the pool tables in addition to a spattering of TV's around the back walls of the restaurant.\n\nThere is no kitchen so don't expect much in the way of food.

A rowdy bar (that holiday night) found last year was replaced by a Chipolte. Good news we found it again. Although we had only been once to the previous location and it was totally packed, the new location was nicer on the inside than what I remembered and it seemed bigger. The location isn't right in the middle of things in Union Square but when the streets are crazy you can walk one more block and get away from the craziness. Just don't go too much further than the bar as it borders the tenderloin which can be a little iffy at times. I also liked that the bart stop was right down the block.

My boss and I were in SF for business and we were trying to watch the LA Kings v the Boston Bruins hockey game. Apparently, most bars in SF's Union Square area don't carry the NHL package but Union Square Sports Bar did! This was the third bar we stopped by to see if they carried the game and were so happy to hear that this bar did. \nThe bar is a pretty good size bar. I was there last Tuesday and there weren't many people in the bar. We got to sit right in front of one of the TVs and watch the game. \nI must disclose that this bar does not have food BUT as the cool bar tender mentioned, any restaurant around the area delivers...  So we did just that! We ordered from this one Indian place (sorry can't remember the name but it's the bar tender's favorite so he will be able to help you out with that one) and it was delicious. It looked kind of funny to be eating Indian food at a bar while watching a hockey game but who cares! lol So just for having that option, I would not take any stars away from this place.", "author": "Beldevina P."}

The tvs ate not huge but there are a lot of them so it was just fine for viewing purposes. The seating options are a little cramped but that is every bar so again not an issue. The issue came with the food. They only serve hot dogs and nachos, I like both of those things. I ordered the nachos and so did the person with me. These were the saddest nachos I have ever seen, ever. The chips are standard chips, the cheese is the fake nacho cheese, the chili is hornel's chili, diced onions to top it off. To be honest it was gross. The service was pretty slow as well, not the server's fault because she was the only one working. If you just want to get drunk at the bar, go for it.

They were talking for a few minutes and he got my attention and asked me if I had ever been there before and what I thought about the girl behind the bar. I mentioned that she had been a  b***h since the minute I walked in there and that every time I ordered a beer it was like pulling teeth.    \n\nSo he starts to tell me and his friend that she is the owners daughter and that she's a notorious jerk. He said to us, \"watch, I bet she'll have me kicked out in the next few minutes because I haven't ordered anything\". \n\nI chuckled and went back to watching my hockey game and they continued catching up and lo and behold, 10 minutes later the door man comes up to this guy and says \"hey man, i don't know why the girl behind the bar has it in for you but she says that if you don't order a drink that you have to get out\".\n\nNow it was a weekday afternoon and the place had MAYBE 15 people in it. So the guy explains to the bouncer that he was out jogging, got a text from his friend to come by to say hello and that they were just catching up. (His friend was drinking, btw).\n\nThe doorman says, \"that doesn't matter, if she wants you out then you have to go\". So the guy looks over at me and gives me that \"i told you so\" kind of look and him and his buddy walk out.\n\nMy game ended and I decided to go and I caught up with these guys outside and the guy who got kicked out said that he's seen it happen before.\n\nHe goes, \"the service is horrible, most of the girls behind the bar are angry and incompetent. sometimes they get around to serving you after you wait for ten minutes at the bar looking to buy a drink. at other times, as you just witnessed, they'll throw you out for being there ten minutes and NOT ordering a drink.\"\n\nHe went on to say that he hates the place and I can see exactly why. It's too bad that the bitchy bartender I ran into on day 2 is the owners daughter, so she isn't going anywhere.\n\nI'm not sure what she's looking for as a tip on a $6 beer, but apparently $1 makes her angry.\n\nHere's a suggestion sister, you might make more money in tips with a smile and a \"thank you\" to your CUSTOMERS, instead of your angry routine that you seem to prefer.", "author": "Paddy O."}

Lots of TV's mounted, not a bad seat in the house at all.  No price gouging, when we were there they had a few drink specials which were reasonable.  They don't have food - except they did say they had hot dogs? - but they let you bring food in from outside.  That's awesome!  They told us about a few pizza places that delivered so we ordered delivery.  Kinda neat to be watching the game, eating pizza w/ our big pizza box right there at our table.  After the game we stuck around for a bit, crowd started to thin out, so we got to talk to w/ Brian outside while taking a smoke break, also w/ Ashley when we were out taking another smoke break LOL Jaime recognized us right away and came over to chat w/ us - like I said that girl was way cool.

PLUS, there are other bars in SF who do not have the words \"sports bar\" in their title who carry the NHL package and who regularly show NHL games. also, on a side note, your punching bag arcade game is gonna kill someone soon...I witnessed a friend split his head open playing it, but then again, he probably should not have done multiple tequila shots before playing said game", "author": "James J."}

Only other places that show NHL in the city are Green's (grudgingly), Kilowatt and Mad Dog.", "author": "Danny C."}

Yeah, the bartender has a sweet caboose and a set of chompers, but hell that is a lot of money for a beer.  The jukebox is nice I guess if you like listening to Paula Abdul and Tito Jackson.  The food is nonexistent.  Well there's food in the shatty, but that's another story.  I could live with all of that but the bums outside kill me.  I pay six dollars for a beer and ten for a mixed drink and it burns me but I could handle it if the bums weren't there.  The sports memorbillia on the wall is terrible.  Try putting some Joe D up there.  For crying loud, who the hell is Pele'?  The Brazilian piece of crap who sucked it up with the NY Cosmos back in the day.  Get with it folks.  Hell, I could handle Mary Lou Retton's tight bummer up there over Pele's leather looking mug.  Get with it USSB or I'll stop coming there four times a week.  Try two dollar beers on Sundays and Mondays chief.", "author": "TJ R."}
