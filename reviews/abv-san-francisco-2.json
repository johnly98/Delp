Personally not into loud crowded places but the kind service, excellent drinks and delicious food made up for it. \n\nThe Mumbai mule(4.1/5) Well crafted and had a pretty interesting bite/spice to it. \nGin and celery (3.8/5) i don't remember trying anything that has used the taste of celery as its foundation but it was very refreshing. simple but unique.  \nThe drifter (3.5/5) nicely made old fashioned but I've  tried better. \n\nThe burger and spicy chips(4.5/5) If you find yourself at ABV the burger is a must try.

Truly a hidden gem; right on 16th between Valencia and Guerrero, this drinkery serves more than meets the eye.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice is the SNACKS menu on the wall. All cocktails / drinks are found in a book they'll hand you. The bar seating often gets rather crowded in the front, and people don't realize if you walk farther back there is open seating, that has been available every time I've been. Also, they have tees next to the menu, and the first thing you'll think is \"ohh, merch- whatever,\" but NO! Each tee is by a local artist AND a percentage of the profits go to charity! In the back, there's a huge mural (that's done by a local artist), two communal high-top tables, and more bar seating before the restroom in the very back. \n\nEating at ABV is such a fun experience. They don't serve utensils so all their food becomes FINGER FOOD! You must must try their Japanese-style Celery Root \"tater tots.\" Last time I went I also had the Pulpo a la plancha con Fritas (grilled octopus w french fries) and it was delicious!! I think it's safe to say everything on the menu is drool-worthy. I really wanted dessert, but unfortunately they don't have any. Our server suggested getting the Soft Cow, which is a warm, cow's milk cheese from a farm in Vermont, served with sides of jam. 100% was the perfect way to end our \"meal\" with the red wine we were drinking. I will definitely return to try the Thai-style anchovies! \n\nIf you're still reading, you must be interested in this place!! Another cool feature of this bar is that upstairs they have a completely different concept called OVERPROOF. It's a fixed-menu meal paired with drink setting, and they change the WHOLE INTERIOR to fit the theme each month!! It's incredibly unique and creative, and I hope I get a spot at their next event.", "author": "Navila H."}

My bf and I came for dinner on a Friday night (we came just before there was a line forming outside) and had a pretty good time even though we had to stand by a wall. It was a bit challenging having 3 plates of food (one was a cheese board) on a rather narrow table that lines along the wal (I kept bumping into the person behind me!). \n\nFood: \nCheese board: loved the assortment and homemade strawberry jam. The jam was the star. It paired so perfectly with the cheeses. The only thing I didn't care for was how buttery the toasted bread was. Less butter please! (4/5)\n\nCeviche: delicious delicious delicious! It's hard to taste a ceviche that isn't drowned with lime juice and that the fish is completely raw. Most of the time places would slightly sear the fish since the fish isn't fresh enough. That's def not the case with this place. (5/5)\n\nPork tacos: these were tasty. Loved the addition of the pickled onions on top. Flavorful, not heavy, and the perfect amount of pork to toppings ratio. I like how thin the flour tortillas were-- although they were thin, they held the fillings well. (5/5)\n\nDrinks were overall great.

It is spacious inside: we weren't able to find seats at 6pm on a Saturday (and were comfortable standing at the wall opposite the bar) and I imagine it must get even busier as the night goes on, but we still had room to spread out and not feel like we were on top of others. There is also outdoor seating in front, tables in the back and an upstairs (from other reviews, I guess this upstairs area is for reservations). While definitely bustling, it was also blessedly not loud: I tend to automatically love a bar where you can have a conversation without having to yell, and ABV delivered on this!\n\nWe tried a bunch of the cocktails and small plates and enjoyed everything! The cocktails we tried were all creative, strong and well balanced. My favorite cocktail was the La Botana, a spicy, mezcal-based drink. I also enjoyed the Mumbai Mule, with saffron infused vodka - an interesting and tasty take on a Moscow Mule!\n\nAll of the small plates were great, too. We started with the foie gras stuffed olives, which were an interesting pairing. We also tried the soft shell crab, Japanese tater tots and octopus a la plancha. The tots were not conventional tots, but were delicious: more like perfectly soft-on-the-inside, crispy-on-the-outside pieces of potato, complemented well by the mayo and bonito flakes. The octopus was tender and perfectly cooked, the chimichurri was a nice complement, and the garlic fries served with it were crispy and delicious as well. Portions are small but satisfying!\n\nOur server was helpful, nice and attentive, as were all the other staff we interacted with. It was nice to have a server helping us out when we were standing in a different part of the bar, as opposed to having to fight our way through to place an order with a bartender. Our waters were refilled and we got fresh plates and napkins as needed without asking, too. This is not a cheap spot ($57/pp to share small plates and 2 drinks each) but the quality is excellent.", "author": "Christine G."}

ABV is a cool place to hangout with tables in the far back and bar stools in the front.  Nice dark atmosphere and I had a pretty good drink -MUMBAI MULE (saffron vodka, lemon, ginger, mint and soda.)\n\nBecause my friend and I got in late from our flight, we were a bit hungry.  \nWe ordered the new fuckin burger  with spicy-ass chips based on the menu on the wall.  When we received our order it was RARE with  blood dripping.  I'm not a person to eat RARE ground beef so we asked one of the bartenders if we can get the burger cooked more.  With a rude and short attitude, the guy says \"NO, that is how it's served, MEDIUM RARE.\"  My jaw completely dropped.  So we sat there thinking \"what an ass\" but I will speak to our server directly instead of that guy.  When our bartender became available I asked again if the kitchen can cook our burger just a tad bit more.  He said \"no\" and said the same thing the other bartender said.  He then said that the kitchen cannot do such a thing because the grill is small and they cannot cook a lot.  WOW!  That small huh.  Like really?  Okay, I get it.  Obviously, there's no changes to the way they cook their food.  The bartender offered to remove the burger from our bill and grab the burger and chips and threw it in the trash in front of us instead of taking it to the back to throw away.  \n\nRecommendation:  Please UPDATE YOUR MENU AND STATE THAT THE BURGER IS SERVED RARE (RAW) AND NO EXCEPTIONS. SERVER SAID MEDIUM RARE BUT IT WAS RARE.  If I had seen this on the menu I would not have ordered it.  Also, if the bartender warned us it was served Rare - RAW we would've been informed and would have not ordered it.  \n\nMy experience here was such a negative one that I will never return or recommend this place to anyone.", "author": "Nette B."}

Ok totally fair, our friend was visiting from Asia and didn't know.

He then puts that chair 2 feet behind me at an empty table.  Thanks dude...  30seconds later he brings me a replacement chair from the bar violating his own statement and abv policy.  \n\nThe final straw was the manager coming over and after we explained what happened and that the waiter needed to be retrained, the manager ends up defending the policies rather than apologize for the rude service. \n\nAbsolutely ridiculous, whoever is the GM is allowing this place to go downhill.

We had just asked for water initially and were denied it. Absolutely ridiculous.\n\nThe most recent experience happened yesterday. My friend and I wanted to sit at the bar and every time a spot opened up, other people were super quick to snag the spots. So when two seats finally opened up across from where we were sitting, my friend ran over and sat down. I grabbed our stuff to sit down and the bartender snaps at us and says, \"I need to clean this up can you wait a second?\" My friend started to help him gather the glasses because she's a bartender herself and wanted to help and he said, \"Can you stop? You don't even know where they go so what you're doing is useless.\" I came back and started to sit down and he snaps again and says, \"No seriously can you stop?\" My friend and I backed off and when he was done we finally sat down.\n\nHis attitude was so unwarranted. We were excited to have a seat at the bar, were trying to help this guy out of basic etiquette, and he was an ass about it. \n\nHonestly this guy made our experience extremely unpleasant and HE needed to back off.

We ordered a round of drinks, carrot hummus, Celery root tots, and fried cauliflower.\n\nBy far the carrot hummus was our favorite. It was a slightly toasted / grilled toast with carrot hummus spread topped with fried kale and pepitas.  We loved this so much we ordered a second. \n\nThe cauliflower had interesting flavor.  It was liked by all but I'm not sure I would order it again. \n\nThe celery root \"tots\" were fun and tasty.  They came in \"steamed\" cubes drizzle with a Sriracha sauce and green onions.  The first bite I thought it was possibly cubes potato.  The texture is soft and smooth like a baked potato and was perfect share appetizer. \n\nWe ordered a round of drinks- solid pour and nice combination of flavors.

ABV delivered on just that: since gin based cocktails are my favorite, I ordered a Mumbai Mule, with a light spicy twist. Not too sweet, not too spicy. At $12 I thought it was still reasonably priced (unlike the $9 tequila shot from a few weeks ago at a different, definitely less cool bar). The interior is nice, not too noisy, so you can still have a conversation. Service this time around was friendly and attentive and kept filling up those water glasses. By the way, the water is delicious here.\n\nSo why 3 stars? Well, it was not the first time I came here. A couple of weeks, we wanted to give it a try, but didn't make it past the door. The doorman for whatever reason decided to keep us waiting, apparently because it was too crowded.

There is the normal bar and a side bar, so plenty of seats (at least on a Wednesday night; I could see how it could get crowded on a weekend). I believe the back was open seating as well. Nice attentive and friendly service without hovering. Decent cocktail menu. I had the Lake Checkout (gin, lemon, passionfruit, campari, manzanilla) - sounded sweet, but definitely more tart, although still very fruity. \n\nWe tried some snacks: \n\nFoie gras stuffed olives - Yum! Great little snack. The foie gras on the inside is in smooth mousse format and the savory/salty combo is perfect. \n\nCeviche aquachile with watermelon radish and lime - This was a little bit of a miss for me. Very spicy, to the point of not being able to taste the actual fish and covering up any other flavor. The watermelon radish did bring it down a tiny bit and brought a nice crunch to the dish, but still, I would skip this one. \n\nGrilled duck heart and cucumber with ufra chili adobo and spring onion - WOW!! Definitely the best of the night. The cucumbers were grilled or something and had an awesome flavor. The duck hearts were plump and meaty. The chilis did bring a bit of spice to the dish, but it combined with the other elements in a natural way. The onions were slightly charred to perfection. Will definitely be back to have this again. \n\nWhile the spirits menu is quite extensive, the beer and wine menu is somewhat limited (esp wines by the glass), but you can find something you like. Prices seem mostly in line with other SF places, maybe some things (like draft beer) maybe a dollar or two too expensive. \n\nAs an offal and weird food fan, this entire menu has a lot of appeal, and I can't wait to try the rest.", "author": "Rebecca S."}

They have two seatings per night, one at 7 and one at 9 pm. You have to make a reservation in advance through RESY (check their website), where you also pay upfront for the whole experience. For the rum pairing, it was $66 per person all inclusive of food, drinks, tax and tip, which I thought was a fantastic deal.\n\nOur 5 drinks were:\nSippin rum - plantation pineapple dark rum\n\"Cuba Libre\" - aged rum, bubbles, vermouth, lime\nPink flamingo - rhum, lime, pineapple gum, tiki-apertif, absinthe\nHurricane sandy - rum, passionfruit, lemon\nPineapple bum - pineapple rum, cappelletti, rancio\n\nAnd our 5 foods were:\nRum ham musubi - house spam, furikaki, rum-hoisin sauce\nClam \"stuffies\" - andouille, cherry stone clam, lemon\nSmoked lamb curry - puffed rice, fried plantain\nJerked chicken wings - coriander, pineapple\nTrini chow mein - broccoli, braised cabbage, green onion\n\nI loved the whole experience from start to finish. Right from the start, our server came over and gave us a rundown of how the evening would go. I love that he made it clear it was a pretty casual affair and that it was completely fine to go at your own pace.\n\nAs for the pacing, they bring out each round of food and drinks at a brisk pace, since you only have two hours for everything. I never felt rushed except for at the very end with the last drink, which I had to take with me and slowly sip at downstairs in the bar area. With each dish/cocktail, they'll do a great job of introducing it--where it's from, how it's prepared, etc.--but in a very unpretentious manner.\n\nThe amount of food was just right for me.

There weren't any communal tables left, but the venue has two of their walls lined with stools and a small shelf-like table. It's great if you come with one other person but not super good for a larger group. The servers were really nice though - once the noticed another party leaving, they offered to seat us at the edge of the communal table which was way better for a group of 6. By the time we left, it was pretty packed, with basically all of the seating taken, and many people standing around in the open spaces.\n\nThe bar itself is pretty dark, but not too loud. I enjoyed having a conversation without feeling like I was yelling the entire time.\n\nABV is known for their cocktails, but they also serve wine and beer, and I have to say it lived up to my expectations. I tried a Mumbai mule (it had saffron in it I believe) and it was so refreshing and just gingery enough. My coworkers enjoyed their drinks as well!\n\nWe shared the fries (which come with octopus on top - this was delicious!), the summer tartine, and the fried cauliflower (you should get this if nothing else). Everything was served in small paper containers (similar to what you'd expect from a food truck) and they give you small plates but no silverware. Get ready to use your hands! I also shared the burger (which they kindly cut in half for you) and that was REALLY amazing. So juicy, flavourful, but a bit too salty.

All food portions look small and therefore, their food menu is way overpriced.\n\nDrinks: I tried the Tarragon collins, jackel, mumbai mule, apple brandy.

Came here on a date night right before I saw the amazing Rhett Miller at the Chapel. Had to get some Whiskey. Would be disrespectful to the man if I didn't. But even moreso, I had to get some grub too!!\n\nMe and my girl got every Whiskey drink on the 1st page. All had a solid amount of booze and varied in flavors. All were good except for one which was the Baker's Highball. I didn't think it was necessarily bad but was for a different kind of person. It had very interesting semi sweet taste in the beginning but then ends with a very bitter after taste which tastes almost like licorice. It was very interesting. But enough about drinks, lets get to the food.\n\nWe got the wings and the Fucking Burger. *Note* That is literally what it was called. I had guy behind me smell our food and was like, \"Sorry to bother you but what is that?\" In which I reply, \"It's the Fucking Burger.\" He looked at me and was like lolwut? But I told him. That's what it was called and it really was fucking amazing. Why? Well for one, I hate pickles. HATE pickles. The burger had pickles on it. I ate the WHOLE thing. That's how good it was. The patty was cooked to a perfect medium rare. Very juicy. It came with this 1000 island, In and Out looking spread and tasty buns. The burger had so much overall flavor. Man o man. Oh and the wings? Eh. They were ok. I forgot the name of them but they were supposed to be like a carribean jerk chicken. They were definitely spicy but I feel like they could of used a tad bit of flavor. Or maybe some kind of dipping sauce? Iunno. They just felt like they were missing something.\n\nOverall, this place was awesome though. Me and my girlfriend loved the drinks, food and the vibes! Everyone here just looked like they were having an great time. Great music too!! They were playing some nice hip hop I've never heard of before.

The other cocktails we had were all stellar.\n\nI could drop a pretty penny here just ordering plate after plate of this great food! The foie gras stuffed olives were good, but definitely share them with others; they're very rich. The blistered hot peppers are tasty shishito peppers - spicy enough, but not murder to the tongue. The cheese plate was full of delectable dairy goodness. The most memorable item for me, however, was the octopus a la plancha with herbs.

I trust most bartenders at places like this and my \"spiritual guide\" (Cecily) on Saturday whipped up some amazing drinks. I started with a variation of \"The Martinez\" with mescal instead of gin, fabulous! Next up was a drink called \"Leftys Fizz\". Basically, it was mescal, grapefruit, bitters and egg white.

It's a small place- some tables in the back but mostly bar and counter seating. Regardless of where you sit, waiters will come to take your order which is nice. \n\nThe menu has mostly some interesting smaller items (think snacks with a little twist or creative touch) along with cheese, charcuterie, and a few slightly bigger things like a burger and sandwich. The menu seems to change somewhat often as it was different the two times I came here. \n\nThey used to have an amazing pimento cheese burger which is very sadly no longer on the menu. I definitely recommend the cheese and the pate was pretty enjoyable also. Octopus with fries was good though I would probably opt for other stuff in the future- just wish it had a tad more flavor. The foie gras stuffed olives are pretty good but obviously pretty rich; I would suggest sharing them and pairing with a drink that compliments their saltiness.  The menu isn't huge so take a look at it online first to make sure it has something you like. \n\nThey have a pretty extensive cocktail list along with some wine and beer. I was disappointed they only had 3 wines on tap (1 red 1 white and 1 ros\u00e9) but the red I had was pretty good and a generous pour. Beer selection (on tap but overall really) was also kind of small and disappointing. The cocktails are well made and thought out. Not the strongest but well balanced. One nice touch is they have a few non alcoholic beverage options for mocktails in case someone isn't drinking. \n\nOverall I would probably give ABV a 4.25 or even 4.5 out of 5 stars. The food was generally good but did vary from dish to dish and it tended to be on the heavier and kind of one note side.

I mean, GOOOOOD.\n\nThe excitement was pumping in my veins as soon as we sat down. There were SO many cocktails to choose from! Take for instance the ODB cocktail: blanc rhum, fino sherry, banana liquer and coffee bitters. It's a brisk drink! I say that because it's not a typical drink you'd order for brunch, but it really cuts through the fattiness of the bar foods that we ordered. If your style is more fruity/agave, the Pina Verde with tequila, pineapple and genepy will do it for you. Or for non-drinkers, a mocktail like the Pineapple Basil lime soda is tops.\n\nNaturally, all this drinking will get you hungry. The Pimento burger was recommended by my fave bartender and boy, was he right on the money! This thing will add another inch to your waistline but you'll be so happy eating it, you just won't give a damn. It's 1/4 lb. grass fed beef patty combined with 12% aged beef fat. (weird huh!) It's a compact burger but the MMMeat is thick and works with the pimento cheese, pickle slices and caramelized onions. I'm drooling just typing the description! It's a really, really great burger. I just wish they offered french fries on the menu, it felt incomplete without my fried potato sticks!\n\nTheir chicken karaage is amazing. Just how amazing you ask? it's served with mini bacon cheddar biscuits. A Japanese/Southern fusion dish that totally works. And you need to order the kimchee fritter which is basically an okonomiyaki topped with bonito flakes. Doesn't boozing make you crave Korean food? ;)\n\nThe time to come is after hours because they're open til 2am and even serve food until 1am. Since I've changed my vampire ways (i.e. need my beauty sleep!) brunch is now my thing. I'm just glad San Francisco is a big drinking town that it doesn't really matter whether you get wasted at 12 noon or at midnight.\n\nABV you just rock! \n\nVesper approved.", "author": "Janice C."}

The drinks are good the food is good, except not having to eat it without silverware.

Which is totally weird cause one of the friends that was here with me had just came here with a bigger group another time of 10 people and the staff that day automatically split the bill for them.   \nOur waitor; a short stubbiyish guy with glasses had such a fit about giving me his name so I doubt he gave us his real name; His exact words where \"oh it'll take me like 20min to split the bill so I can't do that\" Being the nice person I am I asked for a pen and offered to organize the bill for him, yet he still kept repeating himself how it would take him to long. Imo, isn't that what your paid for? this is his only job. Yet on his possible hourly wage plus tips or however he gets compensated here, he didn't think he should spend in his words an exaggerated \"20 min\" to split our tab. After frustratingly told him to split he finally agrees to let us organize the bill for him. And Omg you could feel the weird anger coming from him as he shakingly handed us his pen. Lol what an effing joke.   Even as we organized the bill and took it to him he started to become more difficult and looking for excuse to prolong closing our tab.  Idk what his problem was.

Remember having great convos with the barstaff. They've all turned over by now. \n\nIt was a nice cocktail bar with interesting bar bites.\n\nThis is a review of their bouncer. The angry guy with the red framed hipster glasses, red jump suit, and power trip. \n\nA friend and I arrived around 9:30pm after dinner with friends on Friday. Not busy, no one in line. I walked up with my ID in hand and said hello.  He looked at me and nodded, then looked at my friend behind me, who said hi. I stood there for a moment, and he did nothing...\n\nSo I took 1 step forward to walk in. Which apparently set him off into an explicative-filled tirade about how I was going to have to go somewhere else and was banned for the night because I... who fucking knows, we're still confused. My ID was still in hand and I said sorry and tried to show him my ID. But my extreme act of ... disrespect(?)... was too much.\n\nWe were both incredibly confused, but we left. Didn't really care. He's having a bad day or something. Went to Elixir across the street and had a great time with a few friends, and started to walk home... and we happened to pass by ABV on the way.\n\nHe had left his post at the door and was smoking outside by the street. Didn't even see him until he barked at us through his cigarette. \n\n\"Keep walking bitch,\" he barked. We turned around confused and saw him shaking with tension (we were still so fucking confused). \n\nMy friend thought it would be funny to go into ABV since there was no one at the door. So he went in and I followed. (It was funny, if a bit immature). I mainly wanted to talk to someone about the doorman.\n\nThe door man.... obviously not at the door... finished his cigarette and a few minutes later came inside and went to a bartender to get him to tell us to leave. \n\n5-6 people came in unnoticed while he was smoking. Great stuff.\n\nThe blonde-haired guy bartender who has always been kind in the past tried to remedy the situation; he was put in a bad situation by his very interesting doorman.\n\nI was just glad I got to explain the situation to him. I'm sure he was confused as well but he handled it well. Of course he has to stick with his crazed co-worker(ish). Trying to find someone willing to sit at a door and check IDs all night is hard and he didn't want him leaving middle of the night on Friday.\n\nWe're still so confused about this entire situation. I thought writing this out might allow me to make some sense of it. Alas, still makes no fucking sense :). \n\nGuessing he was having a bad day or something but for whatever reason he dissuaded us from spending $100 there last night and we will never be spending there again.\n\nRealize hiring doormen is hard since you know... not many people dream of being a doorman when they grow up... but sucks that such a great place we loved going to has now been ruined.\n\nGood luck in life angry red framed hipster glasses man.", "author": "Dan R."}

Divided by base spirit, there are some very interesting drinks here.

Their grilled octopus with snazzy squid ink ranch on top of spiced up and nicely crisp, diced potatoes, was like a gourmet gastropub dish.  Too bad it is served up in petite portions. I could have ate 3 of those orders and that would have cost me a mighty 30.  That would have been a mighty meal somewhere else.

These kids know what they are doing, and not in a holier than thou bartender-beard-vest kind of way (vexing and tiresome, especially in the Mission), or a Tom Cruise re \"Cocktail\" kind of way (which still beats self-righteous steam punk), but in the refreshing \"I know what I'm doing and I'm the best at it but I'm still humble and friendly\" type of way. \n\nOur bartender was the master of multitasking - no small feat in a fully packed house with a complex cocktail list.  Even though our bartender was clearly busy, he greeted us and gave us menus right away.  I was appreciative, because that almost never happens. After perusing the cocktail menu, which divides cocktails by type of alcohol (I.e., vodka/gin, agave, whiskey etc.) I started with the Transamerica Punch, and for my boyfriend, the Tarragon Collins. Both drinks were tasty, but the Tarragon Collins was the winner of the evening for me - with only gin, lemon, tarragon and soda, it was clean and refreshing, and the tarragon worked nicely with that simple combo. \n\nFor the next round, which we were able to order with  relative ease following our first round due to our attentive bartender, I ordered the Mumbai Mule, and the boyfriend ordered the Lefty's Fizz. I loved the Mumbai Mule (just wish it were served in a copper cup), and my boyfriend's Fizz was also good but smoky, so keep that in mind if you aren't a mezcal drinker. I really love egg whites in a drink you know? It's so enjoyable. \n\nMy only regret (even though my motto is \"no ragrets\") is that we didn't order snacks, especially considering our dining experience later that evening, which I will refrain from addressing until I give a certain unnamed establishment a bona fide second chance. But my boyfriend had been to ABV before, and he quite enjoyed the falafel lamb dog. After all, how could that be bad?\n\nAll in all, I advise that you have all of your ill-advised cocktail needs met at ABV on Tuesday nights, Wednesday nights - or hell - all of the nights. Normal Mission crowd: hipsters straight up with a twist of douche. Typical San Francisco cocktail prices, but remember that ATMs in the Mission are on lockdown after 8, but ABV accepts cards. Service is outstanding. Bathrooms are clean. Walking after 8? Skip Mission and use Valencia, unless you need crack. And cheers!", "author": "Sunny S."}

There is no signage at all, I didn't know if we were in the right place until I looked at the menu. I ordered a vodka red bull and a cherry coke, but the bar tender was not down for that. They did not have red bull or flavored coke. He was kind of pretentious with his big beard. Instead, we ordered a Mumbai Mule and a Coca-Cola (of course a glass bottle) with grenadine (a cherry coke). The Mumbai Mule had saffron vodka, mint, and other fun mixings which I've forgotten. He made the drinks very artistically, which was nice and pretty but resulted in him being the slowest bar tender I've ever had. The Mumbai Mule, thankfully, was worth the wait and was a fancier, more artesian, take on a Moscow Mule. For straight liquors, they had big, clear ice cubes which is always a good sign. \n\nWe settled at some of the nice tables in the back. The lighting was nice and music was good. The waitress was very attentive and checked in on us a couple times. \n\nABV would be a great date spot with its awesome vibe, fun drinks, and new menu choices (like octopus and potatoes with squid ink ranch!!).", "author": "Alec T."}

It's deliciously light, savory, and refreshing. It's strange, yet very interesting. Definitely give it a try!\n\nThe kimchi fritter is a cross between a fritter (texture) and an okonomiyaki (style): spicy kimchi battered and fried until crispy, then topped with a savory, possibly mayonnaise-based sauce, green onion, and bonito flakes. It's a little too heavy for one person to finish, as it's very oily.\n\nAlthough I'm not a huge fan of lamb, I thought ABV's falafel lamb dogs were quite tasty too!

I'd never been before, but hoped for the best. *Ding ding ding!* We have a winner. Upon entering, you'll notice it's buzzing. Bodies are pressed up against the window and walls (*cue song* \"to the windowwwww, to the wallssss!!!\"), people are laughing, music is playing, glasses are clinking... Happily, I was able to grab a seat at the bar. It was around 8:30 PM on a Thursday night so it's relatively busy. \n\nMy friend told me she was running late so I decided to start without her (she insisted in her texts). I ordered a falafel lamb dog. Wow. Now, this is definitely not your ordinary bar food. It was supremely good; battered just right, fried to perfection, and the lamb was on point. When my friend showed up, we ordered more drinks. I had a Mumbai Mule (saffron vodka, lemon, ginger, mint, soda) and later, a Tarragon Collins (gin, tarragon, soda, lemon). Both were refreshing. \n\nAs the night carried on (and as the topics got more provocative and real), we ordered more food. I mean, story-telling and laughter make you hungry right? Next up on the menu: grilled little gems (I love the sweetness of little gems and ABV's was also charred beautifully!) and pulled pork tacos (great for eating with drinks). Another star of the night was their meat and cheese platters. For the meat platter: Virginia speck, sweet coppa, sopressa veneta. For the cheese platter: cottonwood cheddar, sui generis, moolicious blue. Charcuterie at its finest! Did I mention the buttery, grilled bread that comes with? Hello!

Be careful that there isn't a lot of seats, so you'll either have to stand or arrive early to get one of the tables in the back. The cocktail list is not long but original, like a mezcal cocktail with pickle brine. Overall good and unique cocktails, and the food was also quite tasty, particularly the octopus and fries. The main issue was the difficulty to get hold on our waiter when we actually wanted to order something, but they seemed to come all the time when we didn't need them. They were however mostly really nice. All in all a good place to go with a small group of friends. It might not be the best place for a date.", "author": "Helene P."}

Me and some co-workers checked out this place after failing to find anything else that had the kitchen open past 10pm (I mean seriously, how are the bars open until like 1 or 2 but the kitchen closed before midnight on a weeknight of all nights come on. I could see them closing the kitchen early on weekends but geesh). \n\nActually, we REALLY came because supposedly they had fish 'n chips here, but lo and behold we were told that was from an old menu. Which sucks because the old menu is better than this new, hipster-ville menu they have now.  Like Who tf eats grilled octopus in a BAR? I feel like Bar Rescue has been through here or something LOL.\n\nDrink: I ordered something called a Tarragon Collins, which I thought would have more of a berry-like taste, but after some research realized it's an herb, resulting in the drink being kinda minty and almost cough medicine-like, but still drinkable. $11 for a medium sized tall glass.\n\nFood: Three of us kept it safe and stuck with the only sane-sounding thing on the menu: The Fish tacos. Of course the last of our party had to be persuaded by the upselling server and get the octopus, and falafel dogs hahaha, and luckily he liked it. \n\nSo to get to why this review has to be two stars: you only get TWO small fish tacos. for a whopping EIGHT (8) dollars. That's like 4 dollars a taco. NO BUENO. Granted they are very good, fish battered and garnished with red cabbage and this creamy sauce, but dang this is a Mission bar not some upscale fancy restaurant. Not sure why you only get two tacos for 8 dollars. I could probably see 5 or 6 dollars for two but even that's a bit much for a Mission bar.

Bourbon & Branch still sets the standard against which I measure other cocktail bars, in terms of both the quality and the breadth of drinks offered, but ABV manages to offer great drink options in a more casual atmosphere. The place gets packed on Friday and Saturday nights, but I can usually walk in at most times and find a seat at the bar in short order. Sometimes you just don't want to make a reservation to go to your favorite bar, right? Add in chill background music and a large menu of bar bites, which is available even late, and you get a combination that is unbeatable in my opinion.\n\nI'll echo the consensus and say that you absolutely must try the pimento cheeseburger! It has on multiple occasions hit the spot after a night of barhopping. In terms of drinks, there are many options from which to choose, and I recommend exploring the full menu, but a few of my favorites are the Mumbai Mule, The Jackel, and Whiskey in Church.

The art of there cocktail making is fun to watch (always the best part of any cocktail bar, IMO), and the outcome was quite tasty. And also larger and stronger than I expected. At $12 a cocktail this place is definitely posh, especially for the location, but at least the drink was tasty and strong. \n\nThey also have a bar snacks menu. I didn't pay too much attention since we'd just come from dinner, but looked like you could get some decent snacks there along with your drinks. \n\nAlso like the decor and vibe.

Together with the pimento cheese, pickle slices and caramelized onions, it's simple but absolutely droolworthy. The fact that it's listed as bar food should inform you of the portion more than the price. We split the $10 burger between two people and it barely would have been filling for one. But it's worth the price tag and the several drinks you'll probably end up ordering with the super friendly bartenders! \n\nThe octopus and fried potatoes in squid ink ranch is a must-try. This is the side that'll fill you up. They have about five or seven octopus legs and a small heap of potatoes chunks, covered in glops of black squid ink ranch - a very distinctive taste! A rare combination of flavors and ingredients that work quite well together.

Simply put, ABV is one of my favorite bars in SF. \n\nDrinks here are strong (mostly mezcal, whisky, and gin based drinks) but tasty, and average out to about $10-12 per drink. Bartenders here are helpful with drink recommendations, but not overly and obviously friendly just to get tips. I've switched up which drinks I've ordered, as they are either unique or they put a spin on a classic (e.g. Mumbai mule).\n\nDon't just come here for the drinks - the food here is also awesome! Two items between two people is a good amount. The snacks are on the pricier side given the portion size so prepare to pay up. If I'm looking for a meal out here, I'll order their pimento  cheeseburger ($10), which is a full portion (none of that slider business). If I had to choose one item to order, it would be the kimchi fritter ($7). The batter is similar to takoyaki batter, but shaped like a seafood pancake.  \n\nSometimes \"crowded\" is a better word to describe this place rather than \"cozy\", which is understandable given their solid bar bites and drinks menu.

Hey, but I made sure to pick a bar that also serves food. I get my drank on and he gets his grub on. It's a win-win situation.\n\nSoftly opened last Tuesday, ABV took over the old Tokyo Go-Go space and has transformed into a sleek bar serving cocktails from a Bourbon & Branch and Beretta alum with bar bites from a St. Vincent and Bar Tartine alum. They're currently open daily from 2 pm - 2 am. Kitchen closes at 1 am. \n\nThe drink menu is separated into alkie categories: agave, gin/vodka, whiskey, rum/brandy, beer & wine, and no abv (non-alcoholic drinks). Cocktails are $10-$13. And for all you fernet lovers, they have four kinds available!\n\nI shamefully admit that I broke my 2 drink max rule here. I had four. In celebration of Hump Day. Of course. \n\n(1) Mumbai Mule: saffron, vodka, lime, ginger, mint & soda ($10): http://bit.ly/1l88QDZ\n(2) Dartmoor: calvados, lemon, juniper infused honey, basil  ($11): http://bit.ly/1l89eCk\n(3) The Jackal: rye, lemon, pineapple gum, cardamom & egg white ($10): http://bit.ly/1r6sO7R (2 rounds)\n\nLoved all the creativity and fresh ingredients that went into making each artisan cocktail. They were all well-balanced but my favorite was The Jackal. It was nice and stiff just the way I like it so another round was justified. \n\nBar food is usually an afterthought but the bar bites here are not to be missed. Just like the cocktails, the menu is inventive and not anything I've seen at other bars: http://bit.ly/1qKqcKV. We sampled about 1/3rd of the menu and plan to come back for that pimento burger on a housemade sweet potato bun and dolmas made with collard greens and dirty rice. \n\n(1) Kimchee Fritter ($8): http://bit.ly/1nOF6Re\n(2) Falafel Battered Lamb Dog w/ tzatziki sauce ($8): http://bit.ly/1tVR6oL\n(3) Tiny Fish & Chips w/ malt tartar ($8): http://bit.ly/1neQXZV\n(4) Chicken Pot Pie Empanadas ($8): http://bit.ly/1mkBIsf\n\nIf you like pajeon and okonomiyaki, then you will enjoy the kimchee fritter which was a deliciously savory pancake topped with bonito flakes. We really enjoyed the Med-American fusion lamb corndogs which was battered with a falafel corn mixture and fried to a golden brown. Dip it into the deliciously creamy tzatziki sauce and enjoy! I wish there was more of them though. \n\nMr. NSS loved fish & chips so he thoroughly enjoyed his tiny fish & chips (there were 4 pieces of fried dish hidden under the chips). I had a bite of the fish which was perfectly crunchy with a light, airy batter. The chips were nice, thick, and very crunchy. \n\nI really liked the empanada crust which was wonderfully buttery and flaky but I wish the filling embodied more of a \"pot pie\" filling with a savory gravy or maybe as a dipping sauce?\n\nAwesome cocktails and food aside, the staff was fantastic. All the bartenders were very friendly and attentive (hopefully they stay this way as they get busier), and the bar backs kept our water glasses filled. Shout out to Ben, the nicest, and most knowledgeable bartender I've met. Not only did he make my awesome cocktails but he went through the entire food menu with us explaining how each item is made and with what. I also overheard him explaining different types of alkies to the guy next to us. It's clear that the owners did a great and thorough job training the staff. \n\nABV has an industrial warehouse meets contemporary artistic sheekness to it. It's one long bar with two communal tables in the back and another one in the mezzanine. It was already pretty busy by 5 pm so I can imagine how pack this place will be when they grand open. \n\nNeedless to say, I woke up with a hangover this morning. No surprise.

I got introduced to a bunch of new people through friends in LA and took this opportunity to get to know them a little bit more. They also mentioned a new place opening up a few months ago that served great drinks and awesome food. I was so down! \n\nHeads up, this place does not have a business sign on the outside. We walked a little ways up and couldn't see it, so we went by the address numbers on the buildings. We eventually found it, packed with people inside. We should have known! The joint is a first come first serve seating situation, bar and table tops. There's two levels, however the second level only has 8 seats max. There are also table top seating outside, which we ended up taking for our visit. The staff was super friendly and nice. We had a server and a server's assistant who cleaned our table between meals and refilled our drinks. The server was super nice, recommending drinks and food for our party, even recommending how many food items as to accommodate for the size of our party. I thought that really helped to make this experience awesome!! Here's what we had and here's what I thought:\n\nDrinks:\n-The Jackel for $10. Rye whiskey, lemon juice, pineapple gum, cardamom & egg white. Man, I LOVED this drink! The whiskey was definitely the star of the show but didn't overpower the flavors. There's a lot of citrus in this cocktail. There's also a cool ABV design on the froth of the drink. Definitely a highly recommended cocktail!\n\nFood (from favorite to least favorite):\n-Falafel Lamb Dogs for $8. THE BEST! The lamb dog was thick and full of flavor. The falafel outer shell brought a true Mediterranean flavor, along with the tzatziki dipping sauce. Such a great dish!\n\n-Chicken pot pie empanadas for $8. I LOVED the outer empanada shell. So flaky and buttery. The chicken pot pie was oozing out and super creamy packed with filler. Another great dish.\n\n-Kim chee fritter for $8. For me, the star of the show were the shaved bonito pieces on top. Nice fishy flavor to compliment the kim chee. Great dish!\n\n-Mapo sloppy joes steamed bun for $7. Although I liked the steamed bao buns, I thought the beef was too rich in flavor, tangy and a bit salty. It was good, but just strong in flavor.\n\n-Pulled pork corn tortilla for $8. Definitely not a crowd pleaser for us that evening. The pork had a nice smokey flavor, but I didn't think the pickled onions complimented it as much and the homemade tortillas, although appreciated, kind of thick for the bite. \n\nAll in all, though, this place was on point! I will definitely return just for the lamb dogs and the Jackel drink. It's a new lounge stirring up a lot of talk within the Mission district.

That said, the maple and pear notes were not particularly noticeable.  A decent drink, but no wow factor.\n\nMy friends tried:\nMumbai Mule ($11): saffron vodka, lime, ginger, mint, soda.  Served in a highball.  This was a nice twist on a Moscow Mule, with a slightly savory and strong gingery kick to it.  It is unique so I can see why it's popular, but it's too girly a drink for me personally.\n\nLefty's Fizz ($13): mezcal, lime, grapefruit shrub, dry curacao, egg white.  Served in a lowball glass (no ice).  A bit bitter from the grapefruit and soda.  My friend liked this drink but I'm personally not into fizzy drinks and think it dilutes the intensity of the spirit.  \n\nFor food, we ordered the lamb falafel dog ($8) and the pimento burger ($9) and I was a big fan of the lamb corn dog!  It was boldly seasoned and complemented by a crisp, refreshing tzatziki dip.  The Inside Scoop SF mentioned pimento burger was good as well - I especially enjoyed the sweet potato bun and the crunch from the homemade pickle.  Since they're small plates, portion sizes are small, but since they use fresh ingredients and the food is well-executed, at least the price is justified.\n\nOverall, I had a positive experience at ABV and would be interested in returning and trying more cocktails and bar bites.  On our way out, our bartender hollered \"Thank you!\" as we walked out the door.  That warm acknowledgement makes me even more inclined to return.", "author": "Beatrice W."}

I just know when it's good or bad or too sweet.. lol) \n\nI'm more of a food gal so we opted for:\n\nPimento cheeseburger - $10 it was smaller than I expected, serving size for one and came with no sides :( pretty pricey for what it was. It was a delicious and savory burger, with a good balance of toppings, cheese & meat and brioche bun (LOVE ME MY BUNS).. I liked that they knew to help us cut the burger between two of us without even asking!!\n\nOctopus & fried potatoes w/ squid ink ranch - $10 - we knew this was a must get because.. how often do you hear of octopus and fried potatoes and squid ink in one dish?! This was pretty fairly priced, I think there were 6-8 HUGE pieces of octopus that were chewy and tender but not overcooked. Super savory with the squid ink sauce. Some pieces were pretty salty but it went well with the fried potatoes.. which were perfectly crispy and delicious. This would be AWESOME with beer.\n\nOverall I would be down to return to try some of their other items but maybe only if I'm in the area.", "author": "Emily C."}

Drinks are grouped by spirit type and they are about 4 cocktails under each. I tend to be a bit of a gin girl myself but decided to mix things up and went for a rum option instead-- the Land's End (Jamaican rum, lemon, dry curacao, honey). It was excellent and packed quite a punch.

We easily got seats at the bar, but it filled up quickly. We each had two gin and tonics ($10 each). The fish tacos we started with were fairly priced at $8 for two, and had a healthy 4oz of fish but were on the dry side. Our order of salami ($6) was reasonably-sized, but came plated with our order of cheddar ($6), which was tiny. The portion should have been twice as big, or the price half that. But, this is a cocktail bar. \n\nBecause we had our cards ready, our bartender didn't give us a guest check; when we asked for one to see how it added up, he didn't say anything and turned, begrudgingly, to his supervisor. It's understandable to be frustrated, but it's easy to reopen a guest tab on Aloha, especially when the bar is not very busy and a $20 tip is on the line.

This place is very popular, and is crowded on any day of the week. However, they have waiters who are very aware of who's looking to order, and are quick to take your order, and get your drink. The bar area is long and narrow so you might be cramped for space in a big group, but they do have a bigger seating space at the back.\n\nIrrespective, their cocktails are very good. I'm a big fan of mezcal cocktails, and their 'La Botana' - a spicy mezcal cocktail - is always my starter for the night. I'm also a big fan of their 'Big Ghost' (rum cocktail). I can't remember which rum they use in it, but it's smoky and smooth, and also quite strong (which is always good). When I asked the bartender about it, he was glad to show me the bottle, and also offer me a shot of the rum.\n\nIf you're hungry, they've got great bar snacks. I usually go for the Foie gras stuffed olives, but they have several other options if you're looking for something heavier.\n\nABV is one of my top bars to start the night at, and if you're into well-made cocktails (who isn't?), give it a try.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-04-20", "description": "There are some places that I bookmark that take me a little while to get to and ABV was one of them. Does that happen to you? A \"To Do List\" of good things that you just can't seem cross off. Ugh, just me? Well, for how often I am in San Francisco, it is a little ridiculous that I just went to ABV (acronym meaning: alcohol by volume) for the first time not because of how long it took me to get there, but because of how enjoyable that time first time was.\n\nI got to ABV earlier in the day than I thought I was going to, which was actually before they opened, so I went across the street to Cary Lane and dropped a small fortune on some sample sizes that are a-m-a-z-i-n-g. All in, the block ABV is on is relatively straight-forward with some construction, some older shops, some newer hipster dives, a cigar shop, and (of course) ABV. The Mission District is so fun and blendy that way.\n\nAlthough, if I didn't have the exact address, I would have walked right by this place because the outside is totally unassuming. The front is black with tan woodwork and no extraordinary sign hanging at 90 degrees from the building- just the discreet one on the wall. This reminded me of the time that I walked by the front entrance of The Violet Hour in Chicago seven times before realizing that I was already there. I do not experience shame remembering this story; I'm just saying it happens to everybody (or I am just saying that it happens to me repeatedly).\n\nAnyway, maybe it was serendipitous that I was delayed in my first visit to ABV because I went on a Perfect Weather Day. There was a nice breeze at the bar because they kept the front door open. Happy Hour + a breeze are my two favorite things in San Francisco and even middle-of-the-block-and-not-on-the-water ABV can make that happen.\n\nCarried by the wind, I was greeted immediately and told about specials. The staff was fantastic the entire time I was there- quick and friendly. Obviously, I am a wine girl, so cocktails regularly intimidate me. But, the descriptions in the menu were clear and the very nice bartender made me feel at ease. You could, basically, close your eyes, point at the menu, and order something good. There aren't any failures here. (Well, you know there are probably a few failures at life drinking in the afternoon on a Friday, but there aren't ordering failures happening. You feel me?)\n\nFor my first cocktail, I had the Mumbai Mule, which was spicy and bright yellow; the Mule is made from Saffron, Vodka, Lemon, Ginger, Mint, and Soda. It tasted like curry blended with a Moscow Mule, which likely sounds absolutely disgusting to you, but it was actually very good. What is not to love? It is a beautiful, spicy, tall, and yellow drink with a huge mint sprig on top. Perfect!\n\nFor a little nosh, I ordered the Falafel Lamb Dogs and the Matzo Ball special. The Falafel Dogs were spicy and super hot, which made for an ideal pairing with the mule. They come with a tzatziki sauce and are, basically, a faultless bar food. The Matzo Ball special was completely decent and a nice little side. If I had room for it, I would have absolutely gotten the cheese plate, if only because it comes with Tartine Bread. Tartine is my soulmate in bakery form.\n\nMy next drink (because there was always going to be a next drink) was a Tarragon Collins made with Gin, Lemon, Tarragon, and Soda; it was refreshing and calming after the Mumbai Mule. Excellent cocktail-sequence-ordering for a girl routinely frightened by liquor.\n\nABV has one long bar on the right in the first room and two large tables in the back room. The gorgeous bar has a sensational selection of upscale liquors. It is the kind of bar that I would have designed. Meaning that my imaginary dream bar has books and nice alcohol on it. Obviously.\n\nIf you can, this is a place that I would recommend going to right after it opens or during happy hour because all reports are that it gets VERY busy on weekend evenings.

The fact that they offer 4 sparkling wines by the bottle was a nice bonus for our bachelorette gathering. \n\nModern cocktail bar, without all the obnoxious hype.

We found out ABV sold food until 1 am, so we decided to give it a shot and grab some drinks and dinner. Good service and efficiency does not go unnoticed in my eyes. And this place KILLED it. The doorman checking ID's was very nice and explained how everything worked as soon as we walked in (there's seating in the back for food orders, first come first serve. Upstairs takes reservations but they were booked a week out.) We were approached by friendly wait staff/bartender and our drink orders were swiftly taken and filled (and very good). We couldn't manage to get a table in the back, but we did spot one out front and decided to snag it. The doorman, again, asked the group that was sitting at the table to come inside since they weren't eating and quickly got us set up outside as a server met us at the table. I'm telling you, this service was impeccable! And the burger was really great. I highly recommend this place for drinks (although pricey) and late night food. Awesome.", "author": "Lauren W."}

The staff are good about asking for drink and food orders if you make your way back there so I think it is worth it to muscle your way through the crowd. The back has stools along the wall, at communal tables, and smaller tables for different size parties. There used to be an upstairs that had seating, but the last few times I've been there the upstairs have not been open. \n\n*The Food*\"\nMy friends go ga-ga over the food here. The kimchi fritter! The lamb corndogs (falafel lamb dogs)! Sounds really good on paper...but not so much in the mouth. I find the food overly salty and not consistent in quality. Sometimes the lamb corndogs are the BOMB and fried to perfection. And other times it is a gooey mess with burnt falafel lamb in the middle) Maybe it's the kitchens way to get you to drink more? And the drinks are good and refreshing...but I find the cocktails a bit on the sweet side so my tastebuds are on a roller-coaster when I'm here. \n\n*Would I Eat Here Again?*:\nOnly because my friends like it.

We have visited a handful of times and always had good drinks. In terms of customer service ABV is by far the worst I have ever experienced. We brought our friends here in hopes of showing them a great place in the city to relax and enjoy a quality cocktail. Unfortunately, the bartender was unnecessarily rude and arrogant. When inquiring about the issue we were informed that were cut off. We had JUST walked in and order ONE round of shots, as we were celebrating a birthday, and for some reason they felt as tho we were too intoxicated.  It is beyond me how they came to this conclusion. Only after we ordered and paid for a round of shots did they feel that we needed to be cut off. The arrogant ambiance is displayed thought the entire place, from servers to the menu items.

I really forget the name of it now but I did have a taste.  Very good choice; and the type of better I usually enjoy tasting.  We ordered the dishes that looked amazing in the pictures to me and sounded great just reading them off the yelp captions.  \n\nLamb Corndogs with Greek Yogurt sauce?!?  Whoever created that dish here is a freaking genius!  So healthy and clean tasting; not heavy.  \n\nThe Kimchee fritter was so damn good; tastes like all the greatest junk food flavors are laid out on some easy to bite pizza like slices!  OMFG.  You need to come here to try this!  \n\nI enjoyed my drink and water afterwards and I felt much better after a snack and drink. The bathrooms are very clean and we made our way out of the place and onto the next!  Thank you Yelp friends, you know who you are!  HAHA.\n\nSorry to the bartenders if we were acting or talking obnoxiously while we were here; it seemed like a pretty tame place until we came thru haha.  The bartenders were extremely cordial so I thanked them when were on our way to the next stop for some more food exploration.  \n\n*****700th Review Done FTW*****", "author": "Kenny P."}

The bun was very flat so it's almost like you are biting straight at the patty but there is something mushy blocking your way... Definitely don't order that. \n\nWe also got the broccolini which had good flavors but slightly saltier than what I'd prefer. It was also extremely hard to eat because they do not provide utensils.

The potatoes, however, were a weird accompaniment and they were a bit too spicy. \n\nThe sloppy joes were to die for. With my mezcal drink in hand, I felt like I was in heaven. I thought it was super cool that they were served on bao-ish bread.

I selected the Kimchee fritter and pulled pork sandwich.  Kimchee fritter wonderful light, nicely spiced and not a heavy dish. I thought I wouldn't get full but the food was plenty.  Remember no cutlery--no worry though it is all easy to eat with your hands.\n\nThe mixology is solid; I ordered the Tarragon Collins--sweeter than I expected but Tarragon balanced this drink perfectly--nicely green and satisfying.  I ordered The Jackel which is Rye whiskey, pineapple, lemon and Cardamom.  So many whiskey mixed drinks is that you can often only taste the whiskey and everything else is secondary--the drink was the best of all worlds and I figured with pineapple it would be sweet and it wasn't--multi-dimensional and uber satisfying.

The bartenders seem to actually care for the customers, befriending all of the people sitting at the bar, striking conversation, but not missing an order as well as checking up on everyone if they were all good. They were pretty crowded even at 1AM but not in a claustrophobic way. We were able to get bar seats right away; we didn't explore beyond the bar but they also have a small outdoor seating area. \n\nThey seem to have a great food menu to pair well with the top notch extensive drink menu. Their wall was strewn with so many different types of gin and whiskey brands and probably much much more types of liquor so I can tell they're really into making a good drink for you to enjoy every sip. I felt it was too late to munch on something BUT they made sure to tell me their kitchen doesn't close until 1 AM so that is AWESOME for the drunchies and if you're craving some enticingly sounding fusion bar food rather than the classic trash drunk food.\n\nSo because this time around I didn't get to actually try the drinks or food (my friend had a gin and tonic and enjoyed it), it is mandatory I return and update this review on the quality of taste!\nOtherwise -- ambiance & service already gave me a great 1st impression.

We had the fish tacos (outstanding), the buhn mi (delicious) and the burger (standard, nothing too exciting). \n\nMy only real complaint is that this place takes the hipster vibe to a whole new level. I get restaurants wanting to distinguish themselves, but they don't have to reinvent the wheel in the process. ABV, stop being ridiculous and offer utensils. OR if you absolutely refuse and insist on everyone eating everything with their hands like it's a third world country, have wet naps or something at the table. Eating a burger with my hands? Yeah, absolutely. Saut\u00e9ed broccolini though? No, give me a damn fork. \n\nAlso, let's work on server responses. Us: \"Hi, do you have silverware we could use?\" Server: \"Um, we don't really do utensils. The chef doesn't like it.\" Really? Did he use utensils to cook our food? Then I disagree he doesn't like utensils. How about something more eloquent like \"We actually don't offer utensils since the majority of our food is meant to be eaten with your hands. However, I'm happy to grab you a hot towel to keep your hands clean during your meal, would that work?\" \n\nI'm over the hipster thing so I'm getting fairly cranky with all the nonsense thrown at me when I go out to eat, so take this review at face value. If you enjoy all that silliness, by all means go and enjoy. The food is really good. You could bring some utensils with you, but they might throw you out for that, not sure.", "author": "Jen C."}

I thought now would be a good time for her to try one.\n\nSo I politely flag down a waitress(I don't usually like to use that term because it sounds degrading but she was so rude that I'm going to use it now) and ask for three AMF's. \n\nShe responds in the rudest way possible that this establishment not only does NOT make that drink, but that they only serve high quality cocktails and if I want a high quality AMF, it'll cost me $50 a glass.\n\nAt this point, I'm more shocked than anything that she was so curt to me, as I thought I asked nicely. Struggling to figure out how to bounce back and order another drink, I mumble a bunch of random \"classier\" drink names that hopefully she'll accept, only to which she says \"nope, we only make what's on the menu.\"\n\nThe lady needs to calm down, I haven't gotten into a fight here yet, and she's already looking like she wants to kick us out. \n\nMy friend saves me and asks the lady nicely that we'll take 3 of whatever is the most popular drink, and she takes my credit card and disappears for what felt like forever and comes back with a disgusting concoction of apple brandy and other things I can't even begin to pronounce.\n \nBut she doesn't bring back my credit card. I asked her where it was, and she looks at me like I'm an idiot and says \"I left the tab open.\"\n\nNo just give me my credit card back, I only ordered that drink because it was too embarassing and shameful at this point to just walk out.\n\nI really can't find words to describe how frustrated I was that on top of treating me like I was some mongrel who didn't deserve to step foot into ABV, she treated my other friends who were there as well really nicely.

The bar seating immediately in front of the bar is probably best for dining.  The other counter seats have a more narrow table, so it's not great for eating, but it's still good for drinks.  There are some communal tables in the back that fill up quickly. \n\nDrinks: \n1. Jackel: I love rye, so I had to start with this. It's rye, lemon, pineapple, cardamom - a bit complex from the cardamom, a bit tart, a bit sweet - it was a great drink to start with\n2. Pina verda: I don't usually order tequila based drinks (but I love my mezcal), but I tried my friend's, and this drink was good.  It's tequila, lime, pineapple, bitters - a tad sweet but well balanced\n3. Lefty's Fizz: topped with egg white. The base is mezcal, which was nice and smoky, and they use dry curacao and a grapefruit shrub so that it's citrusy but not too sweet.  I think I liked this more than the pina verde since it was more complex\n\nFood: Family style, no utensils.  You get a wet napkin and a dry napkin, and most dishes come with skewers when appropriate.  It does make it a little harder to split some items such as the lamb dog, but you can get creative with skewers.  Most are $6-10 each.\n1. ABV: bucket of vegetables. We expected something pickled, but this was a bit more oily than I was hoping for. There was a good variety of produce including more interesting things like daikon and a mild ginger. The peppers and eggplant were a bit too oily for me\n2. Padron peppers: hit or miss in spiciness, with some being numbing.\n3. Octopus: wonderful char and tender octopus, topped with a squid ink ranch. The accompanying potatoes had a good crisped outside. \n4. NC style pulled pork sandwich: topped with red slaw inside. This was flavorful, and all the juices soaked into the bun. It's split in half, so it's good for 2 people to share \n5. Falafel lamb dog: the lamb had really good spiced flavor (not spicy), no gaminess, but this needs to be eaten hot so that you don't lose the texture of the breading.  The skewers are kind of big, but they're a bit difficult to split, and each order comes with 2, so plan for 1 skewer of the lamb dog per person\n6. Pimento burger: lots of flavor, super juicy, on the smaller side (but also cheaper). This is also cut in half, good for 2 to share\n\nFavorites of the night: the falafel lamb dog and the pimento cheese burger - both were interesting and had lots of flavor.\n\nI loved sitting at the bar and talking to the bartenders and watching them in action.

He clearly has the proficiency to make great drinks but he was also able to explain them clearly enough to people (me) without the palate or vocabulary for it. The drinks were all well balanced, not too sweet, not too dry, not too much of anything. The only downside is the price, which is pretty standard for SF. I'm not sure at what point it happened that we see a menu, and we're like, \"great! only 11 dollars per cocktail!\" At least here the drinks seem worth it.\n\nThe food was also good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-07-23", "description": "Was pleasantly surprised when we stumbled across the soft opening of ABV (for all you non-beer drinkers, Alcohol By Volume) last week. We went to a movie at the Roxie and were on the hunt for a new place for sips and snacks. Boy did we luck out when we walked into Abv. \n\nFantastic cocktail menu broken down by spirit. I went for the Mumbai mule which is a twist on your usual sf mule by using Saffron vodka and house made ginger beer. Those extra steps really stood out. Hands down the best mule I've ever had. Spicey and refreshing with a balanced tart finish.  Can't wait to go back to try more cocktails from the list. It was hard to pick just one.\n\nBut you must make sure you come for the bites.  All the food is finger food, aka no silverware needed. We chose four small plates, but I must say the descriptions could be a little clearer on the menu. Once you ask the staff, they are happy to give you details on each dish, but wouldn't it be easier to have the menu give us the info so our bartenders can keep on making their bomb libations!?\n\nWe got the little gems, so delicious. Grilled leaves covered in green goddess dressing. Smokiness really comes out in each bite.\n\nThe abv (a box of vegetables) which was a great sampler of pickled and grilled veggies ranging from golden beats to miniature carrots, to radishes and so much more! Was definitely more complex then it sounded.\n\nNext was the kimchee fritters. They were a little too out there for me, covered with Bonita flakes. But my boyfriend, who is a pescatarian was all about them. He gobbled them up!\n\nLastly, and my absolute favorite was the Chicken Pot Pie empanadas. The crust was absolutely divine. We are talking tender, flakey, buttery cooked to perfection. The filling was great flavors of your traditional Chicken Pot Pie. The best part you may ask? Ummm.. As mentioned my boyfriend is pescatarian, so I didn't have to share the empanadas.  All mine!\n\nI should mention another bonus, this place won't break the bank. Small bites are mostly $8, but I believe all $10 and under. Fab drinks range from $10-12. And the staff is super friendly! All of them were knowledgeable, attentive and willing to walk you through your choices. Better yet, is that they followed up with you to make sure that you were happy with your drinks and food.  My only is hope is that this doesn't fly out the window once word gets out. Because this place is a spot not to be missed!", "author": "Victoria O."}

The portions are small so, I would recommend ordering a few things to share. Eater SF has more amazing things to say about their food (next time I'm told to try the Lamb dog)\n\nAt the end of the evening when we got our bill we were pleasantly surprised again to find that everything is priced so reasonably ($4 12 oz beers in the Mission, what?!).\n\nOf course, I can't forget to mention the great service we received. The waiter was very friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. I have found that when places first open you usually have to give the staff a break since they're still getting in to their rhythm but ABV seems to be on top of this.\n\nI think I have a new Mission bar top 5!", "author": "Amanda G."}

Although I'm bummed that boiled peanuts are off the menu, I tried the chicken tacos and they were layered with flavor and wrapped in a homemade tortilla.

We scrunched in with some other people and while the place is super loud around us we were able to hear one another at our table and weirdly enough tune out all the other people. On the first floor is a long bar and then stand up tables, in the back is a large communal table and then the small loft upstairs has a communal table. That's where we sat. Industrial decor.And, did I mention it was loud? But I am almost 50. . . So maybe a younger crowd would not find it so loud.\n\nService: excellent. Truly some of the best service I've ever had in the city or elsewhere. Not hovering or weird, \"hi, I'm bob and I'll be your server\";  just efficient, quick and unobtrusive. Made the experience. Even our water was filled regularly. And we were on the second floor!\n\nFood: we ordered the lamb corn dogs. They were great. Nice, spice lamb flavor dipped in a spicy, crispy batter with a cucumber yogurt like ing sauce. Two dogs are served with these greatsmall metal plates. And, we ordered the cheddar cheese. It came with fantastic bread, I would guess from tartine, some kind of jam and a smear of butter. The cheddar itself was an excellent dry, flavorful cheese. Enjoyed every bite.\n\nDrinks: we tried one drink with cardamom and one more traditional cocktail. Both were good but on the not sweet side. \n\nWonderful service; great food and perfect cocktails....what is not to like", "author": "Vivek V."}

Most places at least try to keep the customer happy, even if execution falls short. But I have to speak out about the completely rude service my party was given this past weekend.\n\nI had a large party for my birthday and tried to reserve some space at ABV. When they emailed me back, they told me that they don't take reservations on the weekend but I could walk in and secure space as it became available. A few friends and I came an hour early to do so and finally a table became available. We were even told by our server we should \"stretch out.\" So we did precisely that. My small party of 4 saved 4 more seats by putting our purses and jackets on the chairs adjacent to us. Little did we know this would incur the wrath of the server that told us to stretch out in the first place! He repeatedly told us we couldn't save seats like we were children with learning disabilities, and when we tried to calmly explain that we were told we could (BY HIM FER CRISSAKES), he became even more condescending. He even came back and accused us of shooing away customers when we absolutely did not do anything of the sort.\n\nEven worse, after we had left to change venues and spend our money on a place that wanted our business, a few more friends showed up and asked the staff where the birthday party was. They replied that we were gone and proceeded to talk shit about us to our friends. Very professional.\n\nIn short, thanks to the the attitude of one guy, I know a big group of people who will not step into ABV again. Which sucks, because the drinks are good!", "author": "Michi A."}

These are mostly all small plates, ready for sharing. We got:\n\n- The veggies (can't recall the name), which were a great combination of colors and flavors; the sauce that came with them was some kind of aioli-esque sauce amped up with something (maybe saffron?).\n- Little gem salad, which are smallish wedges with sauce and the same croutons they use on their burger made with sweet potato-- delicious. \n- Dolmas, which are a unique spin on this middle eastern favorite; they come with a black sesame tahini and are packed full of flavor (tons of chicken parts in here so beware if that's not your thing). \n- Pulled pork tacos, which were one of my favorite dishes! They were incredibly flavorful and had a nice veggie crunch on top.\n- BURGER! This is the best burger I've had in recent memory, for sure. The meat was incredibly flavorful and was really a stand-out at this meal. It was a good size-- not shareable like the other plates. I don't even normally like pickles, but they were fabulous with the burger. Do yourself a favor and order it-- now!\n\nOverall, a cool spot to hang out for drinks and/or food.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-06-23", "description": "First off, I have never written a bad review of a restaurant or bar (for that matter any kind of review for a restaurant or bar) but this needs to be addressed as I think it will happen more if the owner and ABV staff does not get their business/customer service/basic 101 on how to treat people and run an establishment together.  \n\nI went to ABV the other night after about a month or so after first going there and remembered the owner (Ryan) and said hi along with with my date, we met the first time I was there and told him I thought he had a cool new spot in the mission.  When I was leaving this is what happened:  The owner Ryan comes up to me and says \"hey I was asking for some feedback with my bar tenders\" (here I am thinking he wants me to tell him how I think they're doing, which they weren't doing a very good job for starters, the staff was rude to me from the very beginning but I don't buy into that and know people have their days and I don't rat on people unless they attack me which in this case happened but I wasn't planning on singling anyone out) and then he starts laying into me about something his bar tenders said I did.  \n\nNow, before I go any further, this is a bar and restaurant/small bites lounge that charges high dollar for food and drinks, that said you expect some level of service, not kindergarten he said she said bullshit that I had to deal with in front of my date that didn't even pertain to me, and even if it was 100% accurate, have some manners about how you approach a situation and ask before telling and maybe speak in private if you really feel the need to accuse someone.\n\nRyan starts into this thing about me asking for grapefruit juice (here I am drinking a margarita and then realizing he is talking about what his bartenders said I did on some other occasion,) Ha! I'm sorry did I miss something? it's important that your bartenders are happy, but its more about whether I'm happy as a high paying customer, this isn't some run down beer bar that can get away with locker room language, this is a place built to take a lot of your money (which I have spent there and will never again).  \n\nI can understand if I threw food/drinks/punches etc and came back in.. that deserves a talk, not something so petty as grapefruit and how his \"bartenders/servers felt about that and how I need to not be doing that and there's nobody in the city that does fresh grapefruit\" and that he's pissed about it etc, by the way tons of bars do fresh grapefruit bud, shit even hemlock fucking squeezes grapefruit.  Even if I said what his staff was saying I did I as a owner would never approach a good paying customer over something so small, pick your battles wisely as that was very unwise and childish, pissing me and my date off and almost (key word) ruining the rest of our evening.  I know the owner Ryan was drinking and it was 130am but does not in the slightest way justify that behavior.  \n\nHow you approached me without knowing any facts and assumed what you were told to be verbatim makes you a very inexperienced owner and staff, I've ran businesses before and know thats one of the biggest no no's.  You don't even know who I am dude, you just don't do that.  Unless you know something to be empirically factual don't fucking accuse a paying customer of something, got it?\n\nHere I was thinking before how I thought it was a cool new bar/food lounge in the Mission that I'd be happy to invest my time and money into with my friends etc but not now. I've been in the city over 15 years, have numerous friends that own/manage/work in bars and restaurants in the city and help advise some on others.  This is just not good all around for ABV.  \n\nIn conclusion, \nFor what its worth Ryan did apologize at the end when I said your barking down the wrong tree and probably realized he messed up but the damage had been done and frankly I see this place going out of biz if they don't make some huge changes soon.  I've never said anything mean or nasty to anyone in your establishment and this is what I get.  Either someone took what I said completely wrong or I am simply the victim of mis identification, either way it was handled in the worst way possible and I hope you guys change your ways of conducting business.  \n\nTake this for what it's worth to you, that's exactly how it happened and I needed to get this off my chest as it was quite humiliating and upsetting in front of my date.

We had to crowd around the bar a little when we got there (on warm nights, this place is a swamp...next time, I'm wearing short sleeves), but the waiters were really nice in being our scouts in telling us when tables could be opening up, as they were just given their bill. The Jackal was my libation of choice (I'm a fan of the whiskey/lemon 1-2 punch), and the PBJ ice cream sandwich was tasty. They serve some type of mezcal shot at 11pm (unsure if this is SOP or not), so I made sure to partake in that, even though I'm not a tequila guy.

We looked at it for a few minutes and then finally Jovanie went up to the bar to order only to have the bartender tell him that someone would come over and take our order. The couple next to us didn't hear this interaction and a minute later , went up to the bar and they took his order. Hmmmmmm.\nWe sat there for another 5 minutes waiting for someone to come by and we were about to leave when a few seats opened up at the bar so I just shrugged and we sat down and were greeted warmly by the bartender. I got The Jackal which had lemon rye and cardamom and it was pretty good. Jovanie got a Whiskey in Church and that pretty much tasted like straight up Lagavulin. It looked like there were only 2 bartenders for a full bar which seemed a little overwhelming , especially when they make the kind of cocktails that take some time, so I'm not necessarily mad about the blow off when we came in but I definitely wouldn't need to go back unless I was in the area and wanted a well made drink.

Wife and I stumbled around looking like lost dogs probably.  The staff was extremely nice.  They brought us stools when we mentioned wanting to eat and sit.   Food was tasty, sloppy joe buns were amazing, wife's burger looked amazing....  falafel corn dog was a bit confusing since it seemed to have nothing to do with falafel (the consistency of the batter is much more similar to a regular corn dog).  Still tasty though!   Only had one drink since we aren't big drinkers nor do we go to bars very often, but it was one of the better craft cocktails I've had.  The Dublin Cobbler... not too sweet, not too sour (a big pet peeve is drinks that over use lemon).\nMainly I just couldn't get over how nice everyone was.  3 different people helped us out and all were super friendly.  We looked out of place and were acting strangely and yet were treated very respectably.", "author": "howard t."}

I went with two other very successful friends tonight.  We are in our early 40s.    We were denied entry to the bar bc the bouncer didn't accept the UK drivers license of one our.  friends.    They requested a passport for Id.  Seriously????  Who goes out with a Passport.?? We are all over 40 wealthy and clean cut. And you won't let us into your bar ??  Are you kidding me???  I will never return to this place and encourage others not to return as well.   We gladly  walked over to locanda and had some lovely cocktails and weren't carded.  What a disappointment  that the bouncer couldn't use any judgment to let us in.  Pathetic.", "author": "JEFF B."}

The peppers were tasty as was the goddess green wedge.  The cheeseburger was super tasty but relatively small for being a $9 burger.  There's lots of burgers in this city and to keep up with the top contenders ABV should make it sizable.", "author": "around town e."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-09-07", "description": "Went here on a Friday night with some friends.  The layout of the space is unusual in that there's a ton of room in the rear (near the restrooms), but not a lot of seating, so everyone ends up crowding the front by the bar, as there are stools on either side of the narrow walkway.  ABV does food very well, and I wished they would focus more on expanding that aspect than the drinks.", "author": "Jenn C."}

Was difficult to find a spot even with just the two of us but with some maneuvering we did just that.  We ordered the charred padron peppers, falafel lamb dog, and cheeseburger with a couple of the Mumbai Mules. It was not a cheap night out but it was certainly tasty. We went for the cheeseburger since I had seen a write-up on it, but we'd return for the lamb dog. And the Mumbai Mules.  Those suckas are dangerous. The crew here looked like pretty standard new Mission, most people in their 20-30s with a few in the older demographic.", "author": "Sandra Q."}

The staff is all very into what they do and treat each other and their customers very very well. I own Body Manipulations, right up the street. With all the vacancies on 16th lately I was really looking forward to ABV opening. Wanted a place to have less formal meetings. I had my hopes up after reading all the press about the owners. They certainly did not let me down and have surpassed my hopes. The food is all finger food and well thought out. Very tastey! The drink menu is simple yet full of amazing options. I'm a Japanese whiskey fan and happy to report the fantastic Japanese selection. They even have a high ball on the menu with Hakushu. Great snacks and good priced drinks that won't bust you even in SF.", "author": "Paul S."}

The drinks are phenomenal, whether on menu or off menu, the bar tenders are knowledgable and friendly, and the food is delicious.

I am a local in the neighborhood, live half a block away and have for years. I've seen many businesses come and go and would normally give this place 4 stars. Though it's not my type of place I have frequently been to ABV and brought others there because what ABV does they do really well. My two stars come from some exceptionally rude and aggressive service I received on Friday night Feb. 12. A waitstaff gentleman with blonde hair and a baseball hat on was incredibly aggressively rude to me and my 4 family members. The night culminated with him saying \"if you can't play by the rules you can leave\". I was shocked and embarrassed. We were happy, mellow, and hadn't even ordered a drink yet. We left. Couldn't handle staying after such unwarranted bad behavior. Not sure what we could possibly have done to receive that treatment but  I work with people on a daily basis as well and often have to check any bad energy at the door when I show up at work. When I go out I have complete empathy as I understand how much energy is required to work with people and do it well. I am sad to say this place will not feel the same to me now. Places in the Mission come and go, what makes a business special are the people who work there and sadly this gentleman did not represent the business well at all that night. I would love an opportunity to talk to management or even the staff member about it. I did speak to two female staff at the bar who were incredibly kind and sincere about the situation.", "author": "Harini M."}

I stumbled upon it a few weeks ago and loved it the second I walked in. Casual menu, creative, insanely delicious drinks, and the staff couldn't have been nicer. The bar was packed but the owner Ryan went out of his way to make sure we were taken care of. Three words -- gin and celery. Life changing and so unique.  I could drink 1,000 of these. Savory like a michelada or a Bloody Mary but way tangier, fresh (not spicy) and oh so delicious.
