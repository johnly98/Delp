They're not too big either, so I usually pick up at least half a dozen. \n\nI haven't tried any of their other pastries, but I have heard great things about their BBQ pork pineapple buns.

If you want one warmed up with butter, ask for it at the counter. \n\nPineapple custard bun - slightly bigger version of the original but stuffed with sweet sweet egg custard. It's almost heaven in a bun.... except the custard is almost too sweet. I prefer my custard more thick eggy but theirs is more liquid sweet.\n\nCocktail bun- coconutty sugary custard filled long shaped bun.... my favorite. Here, the filling tastes on point, and well spread inside the bun. $.75 each cant be beat either!\n\nBbq pork bun - ample amount of bbq meat, soft bun, meat isn't over-glazed.\n\nBacon egg cheese bun - tasted just as it sounds, can't beat a $2 freshly made breakfast sandwich!\n\nLychee or matcha pineapple bun- lychee cream or matcha cream filled pineapple bun, filled to order at the counter! Cream was good, but unevenly places in the bun. Not sure I would order again. Pricier than other buns ($1.75 for two small ones)\n\nI just love how fresh everything is here.

The Matcha sponge cake was OK as well, nothing too special and not the softest and fluffiest I've had. Something that I will definitely order again though, is the pineapple buns! One of the best pineapple buns I've had, but I guess it's a given that their pineapple buns are good from the name of the bakery..

It's also the only one that sells pineapple buns stuffed with giant slabs of salted butter, a Hong Kong snack that are the bees' knees if you like something sweet and salty.\n\nThere's never a line out this door, but there are plenty of what seems like fresh goods. I've never seen a fly in the bread cabinets, and nothing looks visibly stale. If you want a heated pineapple bun, they keep them behind the counter. I could probably subsist off of those $1.25 buns for breakfast, which I would if they weren't the opposite direction of my workplace. For every tax-free $1.25 you plunk down, you receive a gloriously hot bun, scored with that sugar mixture to resemble a pineapple, along with a solid three inches of cold butter.\n\nThankfully, those buns come out really quickly, or else you'd have a leaking, melting blob. Eat fast, because that butter will melt to form a wonderfully soft, rich bun that's good to the last crumb. Pineapple King also sells some buns to hop on latest trends, like a matcha pineapple bun.\n\nThey sell boba here apparently, but there's plenty of other boba places on Irving you should try.

It would be awesome if they added a bit more filling to this bun, but this is still recommended for salted egg bun lovers!\n-Sesame Pineapple Bun ($1.40): Not that great- the sesame filling wasn't sweet enough, and it was dry and crumbly. I was expecting a smoother texture in the filling. The bun itself was still awesome, and very soft, but I wouldn't get this flavor again.\n-Pineapple Bun Filled w/BBQ Pork: Yum- this was nice and flavorful.

They also offer other flavors like red bean, matcha, pork floss, cream, nori (seaweed). They also sell other Taiwanese snack bread found in other Chinese chain bakeries. Beware!, they only accept cash to avoid paying taxes and don't give receipts which is typical for a Chinese business to get more money from customers.\nYesterday, my sister-in-law bought a small box of Chinese breads and pastries: ordered Portugese egg tarts ( custardy sweet egg filling on a somewhat flaky wet and dry dough tart- average like 2.7/5 and overly sweet custard- not the best I had), cream bun topped with grated coconut - meh like 1/5. \nTonight, she ordered a big box of pastries, breads and their signature pineapple bread. Ham and green onion bread - great for a snack like 3.5/5. Pineapple custard bread - great for another snack 3.3/5. Taro pineapple bread - a taro and pineapple filling in bread roll - 3.4/5. Pineapple red bean paste bread - a chunky red bean paste with pineapple filled bread - 2.7/5. I didn't quite liked the texture and combination on this one (too heavy and chunky texture).Cream horn filled with whipped cream - ok like 2.8/5. Napoleon is a flaky puff pastry filling with light whipped cream and some chopped walnuts and powdered sugar - 2.0/5.\nYou know, what I wished they would filled their buns more filling because each bun filled about 1 ounce of filling. It was pretty sad, but still good. The prices are average for a Chinese bakery, but the quality is above average which is better than Sheng Kee Bakery. On my list of Chinese bakeries from top to bottom on my top 4 list: Kee Wah, Golden Gate, Pineapple King, and Sheng Kee. \nThis is a Cash Only place and don't give any receipts, so you better watch out!\nTry out their signature specialties like Pineapple buns with a sugar craquelin on top of a sweet roll: original Pineapple, custard, taro, red bean, matcha, nori and sweet sliced ham.

Yelp said it opens at 7:30am, but it was open when I arrived at 7:06am. There is no sign that state when they open but that's fine with me. They should really update their operation hours though. \n\nLooking around the bakery, there weren't any \"pineapple bun\" to grab and pay, you have to order them at the register. I might be wrong because I was too early for them to display. Saw some special menu items for breakfast/lunch on the wall which includes a cup milk tea, a mini pineapple bun, and sandwich bun of your choice. I opted for the ham and egg sandwich breakfast combo at around $3.30(?), which was very cheap for the large amount of food I am getting. \n\nThe sandwich was okay; ham, egg, ham, and sriracha mayo(?). The bread part was light and fluffy which was baked really well. The mini pineapple bun was delicious; the layer on top was light crunchy with similar bread on the bottom. They served the Hong Kong style milk tea an it was so good. Reminds me of my childhood. \n\nWill definitely return for the pineapple bun and milk tea!", "author": "Maria H."}

And reviews don't lie. \n\nThe place is small, but they offer a lot of buns and more than just pineapple buns.  I tried a variety of yam, pineapple custard, and black sesame buns.  The yam bun is really good, lots of yam and a nice crispy crunch from the buns.  The pineapple custard bun is also an excellent choice, it is not too sweet and has good pineapple flavor.   The black sesame bun is okay, too strong and heavy on the black sesame IMO.\n\nThe pineapple pastry is also excellent, even better than some pineapple cakes i have tried.  The flavor and filling is not sweet, and it has a flaky crispy shell.\n\nThe pineapple buns here are amazing, a really nice crispy crust with plenty of filling.

They're 2 for $1.50 and you have to order it at the register. They are made to order so sometimes there is a wait. The pineapple custard buns are smaller than the average pineapple bun but that's ok. The custard is warm and injected in. Eat it right away to enjoy it's gooey goodness. The top crust is flaky and slightly crunchy like how a pineapple bun should be, and the bread soft.

When my family and I saw the grand opening sign, we couldn't resist.\n\nWhen you first walk in, the overwhelmingly scrumptious smell of fresh-baked buns hits you. There is a wide variety to choose from -- red bean pineapple buns, taro pineapple buns, custard pineapple buns, plain pineapple buns... you can see why they are called Pineapple King Bakery! Each one ranges anywhere from $1.25-$3, so it's definitely not a wallet-breaker to stock up.\n\nYou can also special order the pineapple puff (2/$1.50) which is a small pineapple bun filled with warm custard -- my personal favorite! There's also the pineapple bun with butter, which is exactly what it sounds like. A warm and sweet pineapple bun with a slab of cold, savory butter in the middle. It doesn't sound like much, but it is SO good; the combination of textures and heat and flavors is definitely special. These can be ordered at the register, and they take about 5-10 minutes to be prepared, but the wait will be worth it.\n\nNo matter which one you pick, it's sure to be like biting into a little piece of heaven. Each and every one is baked fresh with a crumbly top and super soft interior. Yummmmm.\n\nThe only reason they lose a star is because their setup is a bit chaotic. The store itself is pretty small (about 7 people wandering around in there would feel extremely crowded), and their cash register and trays are right in the middle in front of the entrance as you walk in. That being said, you can imagine what an ordeal it can be if you're browsing around and there are also people who are waiting in line to pay or waiting for their specially ordered pineapple buns. Talk about claustrophobia!\n\nAll in all, though, good prices and good buns will probably keep us coming back. Now that we know what we like, we can just get in and out (hopefully without too much of a traffic jam!)", "author": "Yvonne K."}

They're Chinese owned and operated. They only take cash. But today, they broke my heart. It wasn't the food, it was how I was treated.\n\nI thought I'd get some coffee buns for breakfast at work tomorrow (I'm at work before they open). Of course, I got a few other things while I was at it. I get up to the cashier to pay for my  items when a lady from the back comes out with a tray fresh coffee buns announcing in Cantonese, \"Fresh Coffee Buns!\" I've already paid and the cashier is beginning to bag my items. The lady with the tray says to her in Cantonese, \"Hey, switch out those for the fresh ones.\" The cashier replies in Cantonese, \"Don't have to switch it out for foreigners.\" I kept a straight face and looked her in the eyes. I think I was more in shock that they would do that as  a business.\n\nI don't blame them for thinking I didn't speak Cantonese, I'm really tan and was wearing workout clothes. But really? Did you have to say that with me right there? I think I was more in shock about what was happening to my very face.\n\nHaving grown up in San Francisco, I'm under no illusion that racism exists.

While it isn't as extensive as Sheng Kee down the street, it's a de facto place to go to if you're looking specifically for its namesake. I got their matcha pineapple puff today, and it's probably my favorite one yet. I don't know why I haven't seen this elsewhere yet (butter and egg custard are staples, why not matcha cream?), but it would be fantastic if dim sum places started to offer this. The pineapple bun on the outside is light on the bottom and crispy on the top, but if you're eating it warm be careful about the matcha cream inside. It isn't burning hot, but it's pretty liquid, so it'll spill out if you're not careful. At $1.50 for two, it's pretty cheap as well!", "author": "Tony D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-09-13", "description": "One Saturday morning you lie in bed and Yelp bakeries and this place shows up as being a couple of miles away. That's when you say, \"Oh that's an easy walk.\" Suffice to say that easy walk is not easy when you have to drag a 42 lbs, 5 months old untrained puppy along, who thinks every street's got snausages, the best kind are the freshly made horse droppings. Dragging her through the GGP proved to be of a challenge, but we were not deterred. The real challenge turned out to be my lack of geographical senses. I had no idea, for instance, between 20 and 27th ave on Irving is filled with Chinese restaurants, bakeries and grocers. Truth be told, I'm not familiar with and completely intimated by the Avenues. I stopped at nearly every store and checked out everything. A less than 2 mile across the park became a 4 mile hike between Abby and my dawdling. At last, an hour and half later, we finally arrived at a mobbed small storefront next to a much bigger Sheng Kee bakery just a few doors down. \n\nImmediately attracted by McDonald's style happy meal style signage, I ordered B and C, with the distinct Hong Kong style efficiency and decisiveness, along with a bunch of other Cantonese pastries to take home. \n\nI'm a mixture of Southern and Northern Chinese, Han and Manchurian. On one hand, I am drawn to northern style food like sauerkraut, liverwurst, fermented beans and hand made noodles that are akin to Russian, German and Korean cuisines, ordering dishes with a nasal Pekingese accent; on the other hand, I'm completely smitten by anything that resemble Hong Kong and Macau bakeries, and often blurring out near-perfect Cantonese when confronted by the Avenues's Chinese Americans who are most often Cantonese in origin. This establishment evokes the youth in me, where custardy goodness coupled with pineapple crunchiness baked goods dominated my teenage years. Having moved with my family to the hustle and bustle Pearl Delta region boarding Macau, I remembered fondly stopping by those pastry shops like this one on my way to my high school.\n\nTake out trays were handed to me. For $3, aka depression era pricing,  you get 1 small pineapple bun filled with custard, 1 pineapple bun egg and ham sandwich, or 1 pineapple bun egg and spam sandwich (get this one, you must! it's nearly as good as Liholiho Yacht club without the triple digit price tag), and coffee or Hong Kong style milk tea. That's the kicker. Hong Kong style milk tea is delicious. All inclusive, with a price like $2.90 or $3. Less than McDonald. One tray is perfect for two complete sets. \n\nWe took our tray and headed back into the park. Once on the Richmond side, we found a bench and sat down and enjoyed our reward for a near 5 mile walk. As luck may have it, I promptly tipped my milk tea and it ended up on the ground. Abby, not missing a beat, immediately lathered it all up and then proceeded to kick the cup around until the last drop was spilled and consumed. \n\nShe'd do well in Hong Kong, my black furry Golden Saint.", "author": "Victoria E."}

I knew I had to make sure he got the full California experience, so I made sure to pick up a few buns for a quick breakfast. To my delight, the buns had just come out fresh when I arrived in the morning. (Fresh bread is my weakness.) I immediately stuffed a bun in my mouth and fell in love, but I made myself wait until the next morning so I could try a cold bun and write a unbiased review.\n\nRating Breakdown:\n\n2/2 Stars for Taste --\nSince they are the Pineapple King, I knew I had to try their pineapple buns. I grew up eating pineapple buns, but I have never seen such variety in fillings before. They had taro, red bean, pineapple, and custard when I went. The taro pineapple bun was simply amazing. It was fresh out of the oven and the smooth, creamy taro filing was still warm when I bit into it. I tried a cold pineapple custard bun this morning and the bread was still delicious and chewy, with a crispy sweet crust on top. The bun was filled with real custard, not that cream cop-out. It reminded me of the puffs my mom used to make. \n\nUPDATE: Two days later, BBQ pork bun is still amazing. Perfect ratio of bread to meat filling, and the bread is really good by itself too. They use nice, fatty pieces of meat. Mmmm\n\n1/1 Stars for Value --\nSweet buns range from 80cents to $1.25 while savory buns are closer to $2. I purchased 4 buns for less than $5. The buns can get a bit sweet, so I usually eat half in one sitting. When I eat a whole one, I am stuffed! Good for a quick, cheap breakfast.\n\n1/1 Stars for Customer Service -- \nBuns come out fresh throughout the day. The description cards tell you what time specific buns are available (some aren't made in the afternoon), which I think is really helpful information to know. The ladies were very nice and spoke English.\n\nBonus star because I will definitely be back to try some of their other pineapple buns. I also want to try their bacon sandwich, because I saw some FAT slices of bacon with my name on them.", "author": "Abby W."}

Okay, I'm listening... \n\nPineapple King does deal a lot with pineapple buns. They can put cold butter in it, put ice cream, add cream in the middle, make a strawberry cream pineapple bun puff, and even put BBQ pork in it. It's ridiculous how much they can actually do with a pineapple bun. \n\nThe one thing I love about Chinese bakeries is that you can buy like 5 items for less than $5. It's insane how cheap their items are. And they're amazing, too! I don't wanna join the hype, but you really have to get their pineapple puffs when you're here. It's the bomb.  \n\nService isn't overly friendly but they are speedy and will get you in and out fast. \n\nParking is a bit of a hassle cos they're located on Irving St. and it's metered till 6pm so good luck!", "author": "Venus L."}

Sheng Kee definitely has more variety, but I think Pineapple King might be fresher (or if not, they do a good job of maintaining that illusion with new trays being brought out every so often.) I think their bread is a little softer, which I love, and it's just a plus that their prices are a tad lower (think 5-10 cents.) I've had mini and regular pineapple buns (the minis stuffed with bbq pork or stuffed with cream and strawberries), chicken buns, hot dog buns, egg tarts, milk tea... The flavor of the milk tea was a little different but it seemed strong to me. Fairly sweet as well. Anyway, I'm sure to keep coming back for their soft bread!", "author": "Delia Z."}

The boro you (pineapple bun with butter) here was way better than what I had in Taiwan, which was already ridiculously good. I'm telling you, there is nothing like a warm and sweet flaky boro bao paired with cold salted butter. It's a heavenly combination that I have yet to find elsewhere in the Bay Area. Granted, I still haven't had boro you in HK but I'd imagine they taste similarly! Overall, I like that Pineapple King isn't trying too hard by going all crazy and selling a million different kinds of pastries or drinks. Some of the breads here do look terrible but you want to come here for the boro--and for that, they're doing a splendid job.", "author": "Tiffany H."}

DYING of laughter, DYING to eat one.  What he did wrong was peel the bun apart with his hands, which broke away all the crunchy cookie top.  The owner, Mrs. Chan gave him a mini lecture, he basically got in trouble!  I was rolling on the floor when he got scolded.  She took away his bun, then came back with a fresh one.  You are supposed to open your mouth and bite into the bun, that way, you get the crunchy top, fluffy warm bun and cold butter taste in one big bite. But most importantly, you will not waste any of the cookie top.  Learn from Aziz, don't peel the bun apart but instead, bite into it!\n\nWith that being said, I was excited to try this place and relive Aziz's adventure of eating a Pineapple bun.  Every pineapple bun order came out fresh and hot with a cold stick of butter. I was expecting my world to turn upside down with this bun! But guess what, even though I followed Mrs. Chan's advise of taking a big bite into the bun, it was not as wonderful as I was expecting.  Yes, it a warm fluffy bun.  Yes, it had a cold stick of butter that melts in your mouth. HOWEVER, the cookie top was not crunchy or thick enough, in fact, it was a tad too soft.  It's a shame that this tiny bakery didn't have any seating so you can get instant enjoyment to your bun.  I actually bought it and went to TeaWay to buy a boba tea to drink with this bun.  By the time I made it to TeaWay, the warmth of the bun cooled down a bit.  The experience might had been different if I could had eaten it in it's hot stage. \n\nI ended up buying 3 of these buns.  1 I ate at TeaWay, 1 was given away, and the last one I took home and ate the next day.  I put the last Pineapple bun into the toaster oven for less than 5 minutes and baked it back to it's glorious hot state.  Guess what?!  The cookie top was crunchy, the bun was warm and the butter had melted nicely into the bun and it tasted good!!  Much much better, in fact.  But if I had to compare this bun to other pineapple buns I've eaten in Chinatown, this one falls behind because the cookie top was not as delicious as others.  Wish I could call this the KING of Pineapple buns but I'm sorry to say, I can't give it it's crown.  I can give it 3 solid stars...", "author": "Jenny T."}

Being the carb queens that we are, we had to check it out.\n\nFirst off, the prices surprised us. It's very affordable and reasonable. I was so used to the pricey buns at all these other chain bakeries that it was refreshing to see the low prices here.\n\nHowever, just because it's cheap, doesn't mean the quality was lacking. The buns were fresh and soft, and crumbly on top... just like how pineapple buns should be!\n\nThe warm custard filled bun is pretty good. It looks like they inject two of their small buns with a custard filling (think fresh doughnut style) and it's really tasty when it's warm.\n\nI have a few concerns... I'm not a fan of the flow of traffic. When it gets busy (it doesn't take much to get crowded... the store is very small so if there are over 5 people in there) it can get chaotic. The trays are located in the middle of the shop, next to the cash register, so essentially the line to get trays will block the doorway. Also, you don't really get led to the other side of the bakery, so you have to cut through the long line to get to the other side. It causes confusion and delays the entire process, which creates frustration.\n\nAlso, I know they're new so I'll cut them some slack. The staff seemed panicky and helpless when it gets busy. When we ordered the custard filled buns, they asked us for a receipt. Ok... the only problem was, we didn't get one. Needless to say, that caused some major confusion. I think they need a better system (maybe of tickets or numbers) to keep track of the custard and butter bun orders.\n\nLike I said, I'll cut them some slack so they can work out some of their kinks.

Growing up in Hong Kong, pineapple buns are one of its delicacy that we grew up with so when I heard about this place, I was imagining how it would bring back a lot of childhood memories from my home place. This little shop is located in sunset so parking is not the easiest, but it was decent for a Sunday afternoon. I thought this place would serve more different types of pineapple bun, but it's really just another chinese bakery shop with maybe around 4 different types of pineapple bun (while I was there).\n\nYou would walk in, take a tray, wonder around the 3 display cases filled with bakery goods and choose whatever you like. You bring your tray over to the cashier counter when you're done to tally up your tab. Then they have their specialty, pineapple bun with custard or pineapple bun with butter that's listed on the menu where you have to order with the cashier (they also serve hong kong style milk tea, but my friend said it's not great). I ordered one of their pineapple bun with butter for $1.25 each. When it came out, the cashier told me to eat it while it's still hot. I grabbed it and it wasn't hot at all, it was luke warm, but not hot enough to melt that slice of butter they have wedge between the bun. It wasn't too bad, nor it brought me back to HK singing on top of the hills. It's soft bread with the crunchy top custard is decent, but the ones in HK just melts in your mouth, this one didn't do that. To sum it up, I think this is just another bakery with a little bit more pineapple bun to choose from.\n\nWill I visit again? I don't know, maybe if I'm in the area....", "author": "Elaine Y."}

All the baos were fresh out of the oven, and trying not to drool right then and there was one of the most difficult things I have ever done!\n\nI ordered a few pineapple buns, one with a custard filling, one with a taro filling, and one with a red bean filling. The baos were a little flat and no where near as puffy as other ones that I've had fresh. I personally did not like the filling to bao ratio. The baos were a little doughy for my liking. I thought the baos could have used a little more filling to better balance the baos. My favorite of the three was the red bean. The level of sweetness was perfect, and the red bean was really flavorful. The taro was good, but a bit too sweet for me. The custard was okay, but you could definitely find a better custard filled bao somewhere else.\n\nI also ordered a coffee bun and egg tarts. I didn't get a chance to try the coffee bun, but my friend said it was really good, and that it tasted even better than the pineapple buns. I was not expecting much from the egg tarts, but the tart was surprisingly flaky. However, there was way too much sugar in the custard, which made it taste a little off.\n\nI plan on coming back soon to try the pineapple ice cream bun and the pineapple puffs!", "author": "Vivian L."}

She put on the plastic gloves and open the case, I had to stopped her right before she grabbed the bao, \"miss, you can't use those gloves to grab the bun since you used it to open the display case\".  She paused and said, 'ok, you grab it yourself and handed me the bag'.  I don't mind the self serve, but I am done with this place.\n\n1. Pineapple Custard/puff -- custard flavor is good but it is way too doughy.  You probably get 1 teaspoon of custard per bun, I mean, seriously?\n\n2. Cocktail bun --dry and doughy\n\nWhat makes a bun/bao good, the fillings.", "author": "SF F."}

I am greeted with a friendly face and asked if it's my first time visiting. I shyly say yes and order my bun. The lady taking my order is super nice and hands me a fresh warm bao and tells me to eat it right away while it's warm. There is nothing like the first bite. Slightly crispy, the topping quickly turns into crumbs and forms a mustache on my upper lip. Then the butter hits you. Awesome.", "author": "chi l."}

They have become one of our favorite breakfast options.  And We like the smaller size ones, perfect for small afternoon snack and for the kids!  One of the best places in SF (the other one is in Inner Richmond so finally has a good one in Sunset) for pineapple buns!", "author": "KK C."}

Im not an expert on pineapple buns but god dammmmmm their pineapple buns are delish!! And prolly best in town. I ordered the pineapple bun with butter and also the pineapple buns with custard..
