The service was very weird, the staff was disorganized and on some of the tables there was watermelon everywhere! Their initial introduction was quite cool because instead of a conveyor belt that other sushi places have, this place had the sushi on plates that were on top of wooden boats, floating on water around the chef. The novelty of the floating boats wears off pretty fast, when you start looking at pricing. The price of each dish depends on the design on the plate, ranging from about $1.95-$5.95. I would understand that price for maybe half a roll, but the plates are for 2 PIECES of sushi! And the sushi was okay, nothing special at all. Definitely would not recommend coming here.", "author": "Grace D."}

What I really wanted was some crispy, roasted pork belly, but I was so hungry and tired from walking up and down the hills that anything looked good and Floating Sushi Boat was it.\n\nI'm a sushi ho. I can eat sushi all day, everyday, every night, for the rest of my life and never get tired of it. It's like water to me: essential to living a happy, healthy, and fulfilled life. There were so many good-looking Chinese restaurants around, but my coworkers and I decided on Floating Sushi Boat because of how excited I was walking by it. Thinking back, it was probably the best choice since the majority of my coworkers have very limited palates and are extremely picky eaters.\n\nThe woman who sat us was a little abrasive. She probably wasn't too happy about us making a bee-line for the sushi bar, but that's what we wanted... or so I thought. Honestly, I was the only person who ate entirely from the bar (two workers got rice bowls). I have no idea what I ate besides the seaweed salad and a California roll, but it was all so good! I was worried about a roll having shrimp and real crab in it (allergic), so I asked the chef and he made me one without. It was hot and crunchy and just too good. I had to ask for another one.\n\nAll that damn walking make me so thirsty, so I was gulping down water like crazy. Made my way down to the bathroom that was in the basement... where all of the cooking goes down. It's like a completely different continent down there! I definitely felt like I didn't belong. The bathroom wasn't as clean as it could have been, but it's not like I was eating in there or anything.\n\nMy bill came to about $21 which isn't bad for 6 plates of sushi and a plate of seaweed salad. I'm a little surprised by the reviews. Lost of Yelpers saying they wish they could zero-star reviews. I didn't think the place was THAT bad, but definitely needed some improvement.

Later when the check came, she didnt even take it but the chef handled it to me. The chip on my card had some problem and she talked very loud to me asking for cash and all. I didn't have enough so I asked to try again. Her attitude wasn't corporate at all. Failed again. It happened a couple times before at CVS so I am sure it wasn't my card. I stepped in the cashier table and pulled her asides ;))) I did it myself, swiped the card i/o and it worked! I showed it to her and she didn't even apologize! I told her next time she should be calm. Her way is no way close should be treated customers. Our $ provided food on your mouth and rent on your head so at least, give some courtesy. Like I will run out without pay or so.\nThe chef came and apologized so many times. I mentioned he was great, it was her attitude that Made me upset. She walked out and had her dinner!?! How rude! I wished I had enough cash to give $ directly to the chef i/o writing on my card!\nThe owner seriously needs to train her again or do something about this!!!!!!", "author": "Bao V."}

The conveyor held several items that looked as though they should have been pulled hours before during lunch time. On top of that they already had some 12 dishes pre made just sitting out on one of the counters within the sushi bar to replace the plates as they were pulled.\n\nI grabbed one item off of the belt at $4.99 and it was okay, I also ordered their special of orange ginger teriyaki chicken bowl which was priced around $10. The salmon, crab, and cucumber roll up was okay - salmon looked a little iffy but tasted fine. The chicken bowl came with a miso soup that tasted like salty water with a hint of miso flavor. The chicken bowl was horrific, with the name of teriyaki I assumed I was getting something broiled or grilled in a soy type glaze with the 'orange and ginger' flavors incorporated somehow. What I received was instead a deep fried pounded chicken soggy from a flavorless sauce sitting atop a mound of mushy improperly prepared white rice.

Their signs said $.99 and up sushi boats, there was practically no $.99 boats other than cookies and other random filler food.  Higher priced boats had real sushi, but overall not good value for the price. PLUS, the food on the boats did not look fresh at all.  Also, they advertised out front that they have 4 draft beer, but when we sat down and asked about it the waitress said they only have two options (Sapporo and Blue Moon).\n\nBad: terrible (and non-existent) service. No one who worked there was friendly.  Not the waitress, not the \"sushi chef\", not the lady at the cash register.  The waitress sat us by the sushi boats after we walked in, took our drink orders, then pretty much just disappeared.\n\nUgly: The Boba drinks.  That's the ONLY reason I even went into the restaurant- i was craving a boba drink.  I saw on the store front that they had a large variety of boba drinks, so we in and I ordered one.  After the waitress took our drink orders and disappeared for more than half an hour, we were done with eating and ready to head out.  Still no boba.  hmm.  My fiance went to the waitress and asked about it, she walked right out of the restaurant to the shop next door, and picked up the boba drink from them!!!  WHAT?!   Even worse, the drink tasted awful.  All the boba were stuck together as one big chunk, and they did not come up through the straws.

The \"99 cent\" plates were dirt covered cookies and jello. \n\nOn top of that, they use intricate plates designed to easily confuse expensive plates with cheap prices.\n\nThe waitress told me they didn't have some of the items on the menu available so I settled for a floating plate of Ikura (Roe eggs) and Salmon Sushi. I felt immediate sharp stomach pains within the hour....\n\nWhat finally compelled me to write this very brutal and honest review was the fact they tacked on a 15% gratuity onto our bill. My 2 plates came out to over $11 while my friend's 2 plates came out to $9. We were basically forced to pay 15% for racist service, disgusting/rotting food and a molding building to dine (may die in?) in. \n\nRunning your tongue on a bed of nails in hell would prove to be more healthy and appealing than wasting your money at this establishment that should really, really be shut down by the FDA.\n\nTourists, you have been warned.", "author": "A S."}

Also, they have menus with prices that are apparently incorrect by what the waitress said after I had already ate and knowing full well that i pointed to the item on that same menu.

You know it's a bad place when they have to show off how 'clean' they are, especially a score of '90,' which local McDonald's get better scores.\n\nEdit: Look up the restaurant on the health inspection website. Literally a score of 70's prior. Absolutely repulsive.\n\nThe food was sub par and overly expensive. The sushi on the boats were stone cold and repulsive. Three small rolls for 5 dollars is an insane amount for a joke of a dish. The nice thing is you can truly taste the 'quality.'\n\nI ordered the beef teriyaki donburi. The donburi i had was disgusting and the size of a small rice bowl. The teriyaki reeked of cheap processed canned goods and the rice was ice cream cold. The beef was a struggle to get down considering it was undercooked and smothered with the foul sauce. Considering it took 20 minutes to make this 10 dollar mediocre bowl, not again ever.\n\nAnd don't even ask me about the customer service. When I asked one of the servers \"What would you recommend\" and \"how big was the Donburi?,\" she rudely told me to go outside and look at the photos. How f-ing rude.

On this visit however, I've made some observations and I find this place to have some bad service and the food wasn't really that good. \n\nToday, I arrived with two of my friends from college and they wanted to see Chinatown in San Francisco so we decided to head there for fun. After exploring the area, we were hungry and found this place to what I've remember was pretty good and pointed it out. We decided to head there and order food. I ordered the bento box which came with rice, teriyaki chicken, edamame, california rolls, and honeydew boba. When the lady came up for us to order, one of the things that I always ask when I order boba tea is that if the flavor mentioned on the menu is for milk tea or green tea because I'm lactose intolerant. When I asked if it was milk tea, she said \"no, no milk\" so I say sure I'll order one. When the drink arrived, it had milk.... Not really wanting to start a problem, I decided to try it and see if I could even finish it. One sip from it, and it tasted pretty bad. I asked my friend to try it to see if it was just me and she didn't find it pleasant either. I left the drink there and didn't bother finishing it (it was practically full).\n\nNext, our dishes arrived. The bento box that I order was \"meh\". the teriyaki chicken had no flavor, the edamame had no salt, and the california rolls was really small. Overall not really impressed by their food on the menu but their sushi was actually decent, so if you're going there to eat, go for the sushi, it is your safest bet on a decent meal (though I would suggest trying to find another spot)\n\nServices and hospitality here are bad. In here, my friend had asked for a fork and straw which the lady took a while to get it. Other people (most likely tourists) were also not pleased with the services, as some were ignored and had to call the waitress several times to ask what she wanted. The place itself at the time was not really busy but not empty either. Then another thing I've seen was the waitress was doing tasks while she was on her cellphone, which in my opinion, is pretty unprofessional of them. I feel like the only reason they have so many customers is because they are tourists and that was the first restaurant they spotted and showed that it had a boat serving you food. \n\nI would honestly suggest to try to find another place to eat.

Yes, open up a Japanese restaurant in the middle of touristy Grant Street Chinatown, and throw in some water and floating boats.  How else would you get people to pay ridiculously disgusting prices for ridiculously disgusting food?  Sneaky sneaks.\n\nI'm not one to fall for any tourist traps like this, nor do I like floating sushi boat restaurants because the ones I've been to, while decent, were not as fresh as I like my sushi.  However, after a recent bout with food poisoning, all I wanted for lunch was a bowl of udon noodles, and there's nowhere else to get it but Floating Sushi Boat.  These people seriously have a monopoly on Japanese food in the area.\n\nAround 12:45, the restaurant was mostly empty.  I went in, ordered some tempura udon (~$8) and gyoza ($5.95) to go.  While I was there, I realized that the place was run by Chinese people because there was a woman (I'm guessing she's the owner) telling the one single server that she needed to give people menus, take drink orders, and clean up before the customers leave.\n\nI was told to wait about 10 minutes for my food, and I watched the sushi pieces float around.  They didn't look bad, but they didn't look like anything special or good (Fune-Ya is much better, and that's saying a lot).  In addition to the sushi boat, they also have different types of chicken and pork katsu, teriyaki meats, and noodle soups.  The prices are really high for what the stuff is - my lunch cost me $16.35! - but considering it's the only Japanese place around, I was left with no choice.\n\nThe gyoza was actually not bad, which warrants maybe a 3-star rating.  The skin was sauteed crispy at the bottom, and it had plenty of flavor (they drizzled the dipping sauce on top), but the inside was packed too densely (which I guess is better than not enough) and therefore was a little too hard and tough.  But 5 pieces of mediocre gyoza for $5.95 is kind of a ripoff.\n\nMy tempura udon was a complete and utter disappointment.  Not only was the tempura completely bland, the noodle broth was also lacking in flavor.  It moderately satisfied my craving for udon noodles and warmed me up on a cold afternoon, but I seriously prefer the instant kinds where you just add hot water.\n\nSince I've heard of coworkers getting sick off their sushi, and since my food was pretty meh, I don't think I'll be back.

Let me start off by saying that the workers here are all RUDE. I didn't even bother to tip them, it was really that bad. Let me elaborate.\n\nMy mother and I decided to come in here as the front windows advertised $.99 cent plates, after coming in, we found out those plates are just jello and cookies. But they have bento boxes so this place was starting to look up. I ordered salmon teriyaki with tempura. When I received my food, it all tasted old. My salmon, was burned and so was my mother's. We ordered tapioca drinks and you can just tell the tapioca was old. Like, from the day before. The drinks, were still powered on the bottom and when brought to the attention of the workers they give you attitude and don't even offer to make you another one. While I was eating, I nearly threw up as one of the workers decided to clean the drains for the \"floating boat sushi area\" right next to me. She literally pulled the drain plug out and left the debris catcher next to my bento box as she went to grab tupper ware to put it in. When she came back, she dumped the contents into the container and put it right back in. That isn't even the grossest part. She then took the order that was waiting from the top of the sushi bar to hand another customer her food. For this, I will never come back.Upon asking for my check, the lady working wouldn't hand me my receipt. Now this sounds a little strange but let me point out that she brought everyone else their bills and as for myself, she told me from across the restaurant to come to her for it. This puzzled me, including the people who sat next to me -who was handed their check.So if you happen to work here and was present that day, the little girl that didn't tip anything.

Most of the rolls on the boat were basically avocado and imitation crab (yes, it's imitation because I'm allergic to real crab), decorated with roe or eel on top or fried. We were rather disappointed at the \"choice\" thus ordered a caterpillar roll off the menu. Overall I found everything soft and decadent which was perfect since my jaw gets tired easily. I peeked at the chef as he piled on the rice and smushed it onto the seaweed (making the roll denser and the customer fuller on cheap grains) and some of the rolls were actually falling apart when picked it up because they weren't rolled tightly!

It was absolutely gorgeous and sunny which is out of the norm for this time of year. So I thought what better way to spend the day than being in the city. Sadly my excitement came to a halt after my dining experience at The Floating Sushi Boat. The not-so-friendly staff, and empty seats should have been a hint of what was yet to come but we decided to stay anyway. \n\nI ordered the \"Super Duper Roll\" and also picked up something that resembled Unagi off of the floating boat. The sushi was poorly assembled and not very fresh. I was clearly mistaken by the Unagi by the way, which tasted like a cheap imitation and was very cold. I am by no means a picky eater but the food was just terrible. The waitress never checked on us once which I found very unsatisfactory as we were the only ones dining at the moment. \n\nI was shocked when I got the bill, not only was it outrageously overpriced they had also included an 18% gratuity.

I am not a picky eater and started hammering down sushi. It probably wasn't until my fifth or sixth piece that I noticed the rice was crunchy.  Not very good. Everyone else had figured this out well before me and I am sure were asking themselves what the hell was wrong with me and why did I keep putting this garbage in my mouth.\n\nSadly the friend that picked this restaurant had to deal with a sick wife as a result of what was floating around endlessly in those boats.

I'm glad that didn't happen.\n\nOkay, let me start out by saying that I know better than to eat Japanese food not only in a touristy part of San Francisco, by in Chinatown of all places, where there's enough amazing dim sum to satisfy even a Texas-sized hunger. Unfortunately, we were between walking tours and had only 20 minutes to eat lunch - so a sushi boat seemed ideal. Well, time-wise it nearly was, but I think that's the only possible positive I can come up with.\n\nThe one lady making sushi was dead to the world - no interaction with any of the folks at the bar at all - and very lackluster with the selection of sushi she was putting together. In fact, she really only did one roll - California roll. There was some attempt to mask it by putting different things on top, but there was no fooling anyone. Especially when everything was thick and sloppily mashed together and fell apart the moment it was touched with chopsticks. Well, at least the ingredients were fresh, right? Yeah no - the avocado was already brown when it made it's first (though likely just the start of endless) loops around the moat. The fish itself was paper thin, too, so no salvation to be found even there. Oh, best part was the ridiculous price!\n\nIt's hard to explain further why this place wasn't good. It just... wasn't good. At all. The servers seemed dazed and unhappy, the atmosphere was oppressive, and it took us forever to get our check despite being the only people paying at the time.

I was down here in SF for a vacation. For the first day, I actually ate at a restaurant down the street after seeing this place. I'm a sushi fiend and sushi is what I love to eat. I wanted to eat here because I never experienced a floating sushi boat restaurant before. This is just a different type of experience to eat sushi and I wanted to go even more--past tense, \"wanted.\" \n\nSo I walked inside just to see what time they closed. It was already 11pm, so I was thinking it closes late. I walked in and asked the lady, which you can already tell she couldn't speak fluent English, \"What time do you close?\" Surprisingly, she had no answer!! What kind of a restaurant doesn't know when the establishment closes. I was shocked but at the same time laughing inside. \n\nSo the next day, I was in the same area again, and I thought to myself, \"Self, let's go back and order a spicy scallop hand roll.\" When I asked the waitress to order, she said that there's \"NO MORE.\" That's when I knew never to come back. Even something as small as scallops, they don't keep extra in stock. That is ridiculous. \n\nI didn't even try the food, just from that experience and I knew never to go back into that place ever again!!!", "author": "Joanna H."}

To top it all off, the toilet paper holder even fell apart when I stopped in the bathroom before we left.\n\nInterestingly enough, once we left we ran into a bartender from the last place we stopped and told him about our terrible experience, and he basically said \"that's what you get for sushi in Chinatown.\"  FAIL!", "author": "Megan K."}

One problem: it was \"fish cake ramen\" without fishcake. After I requested the owner took out two tiny pieces of fish cakes without apologies. It came direct from the fridge and even tasted like the fridge. I won't say the owner is rude, but she is definitely very cold. Not even smiling back when I pay.\n\nAnyway since my gym is really close the second time I stopped by there and I saw the \"1 dollar sushi\" sign. So I decided to give it another try. The actual price of the sushi was WAYYY over 1 dollar (I just saw other people commenting on this, I hated that I didn't see this earlier). In fact they are 3 dollar, 4 dollar and 5 dollar choices. So a few pieces of suchi cost me $15 bucks. It took me literally 5 minutes from sitting down to asking for the check, and I wasn't even full when I got out. The sushi was not delicious. Not fresh and much worse than Lee's deli dollar sushis. but the price is not your \"budget dinner place in Chinatown\" price. \n\nI noticed the first time I was one of the two customers there. And the second time I was by myself. I'm pretty curious how this place can keep running given it is relatively spacious (and clean! surprisingly). I hope the owner make some changes otherwise I'm sure it won't last very long. Realizing this I feel sorry for the owner.

I didn't expect the greatest service considering we were in Chinatown, but this place literally set the record for worst dining experience ever. We came in at around 2pm on a Sunday and were not greeted at all. The waitress directed us to sit at the bar and quickly and unwillingly explained to us how the system worked. I saw a bug crawling on the table but didn't even bother to point it out because of the waitress's attitude. The plates are differentiated by the design of the plate that corresponds to the pricing. All the dishes looked like they had been sitting out for a while and everything just looked very un-fresh. All the sushi is premade and stored in these disgusting boxes. Every once in a while, the waitress will transfer the sushi from the box to the plates on the boats. I was so disgusted that I only had one plate of eel nigiri. After we ate, we went up to the register to pay and ran into another problem. My plate was $4.40 so I handed her a $20 bill. The corner of my bill was slightly ripped and she said she couldn't accept it and even argued with me and asked if I would accept a ripped $20 bill if I were in her shoes. That was literally the tipping point for me. I didn't have any other cash on me so I was about to just walk out because I was so fed up.

I am not from SF, in fact I'm just visiting for a few days from LA. So as a tourist I came into this restaurant mostly because it looked like the most attractive little spot in Chinatown for a snack as I was walking down the street site seeing. That being said, I walked in and sat by the sushi bar where the little boats seemed to look super cute to me. I giggled at the site and went to grab my phone to take a picture. That's when the owner so rudely came over to ask me in the most rude possible way if I was going to take pictures or eat? Of course I just put my phone away, apologized for it and asked for a menu and water. I'm not a negative person so I just disregarded her rude tone. She on the other hand was obviously the opposite because she was such a negative person. She came back to my table with the menu and water I asked for and basically threw it beside me. I disregarded that as well, being that I felt obligated too since I accidentally offended her by trying to take pictures. I didn't trust the sushi so I just order vegetables, and edimami as a snack. She brought them both over but I saw two pieces of shrimp in my vegetable plate and figured they just fell in since I didn't order shrimp. I didn't eat them because again I didn't trust any fish lol. I get my check and it's a whopping $35 for water, edimami, and a small plate of veggies. Really? I asked why she charged a $7 gratuity and why the veggie plate was $18. She said because it had shrimp and because that's how waiters make the money! In my head I was like are you serious! But she must have read my body language and noticed how upset I was. Instead she decides to even more rudely say to just pay the check and go if I didn't like it. Ugh Ticked me off so bad but I paid my tab and left anyway. I don't need negative energy from a stranger.

No, not because I don't like sushi; rather, I love sushi more than a morbidly obese child loves twice-fried Twinkies.  It's because I hold these raw fish creations with such esteem that I eschew any and all restaurants that serve it on tiny water vessels that have sailed the health-violation seas for hours on end.  \n\nYou know the places I mean.  Someone in the restaurant industry had the genius idea to cut back on waiters and instead serve raw fish on mini boats that circle the sushi bar until someone decides it looks appetizing.  No matter that the raw flesh often sits out all day, or that hordes of people breathe their hot, germ-y breath all over the sushi, or that many of the most indecisive patrons reach for one, pull it from the boat, examine it, and then put it back, only to repeat said health code violation until satisfied.  \n\nHowever, this place felt a little different.  The fish was surprisingly fresh and lacked the film that often coats food that sits unnoticed while begging for attention.  The rolls were interesting and varied.  The presentation wasn't half-assed.\n\nThough I wouldn't actively pursue going here again, if I were again meandering through Chinatown and needed somewhere fast, cheap and Japanese to dine, I would surely consider dining at Floating Sushi Boat again.", "author": "Christine M."}

They pulled this roll off the boat instead of making a new one and apparently this roll had sailed further than the Nina, the Pinta and Santa Maria combined because the rice had fossilized into a rock hard, impenetrably crunchy wall around the exterior of the roll. I couldnt even tell you how the inside of that roll was because I couldnt reach it. \n\nI'll admit, I actually look fondly at this place whenever I walk by because it's been a couple years and nostalgia has kicked in.

Will definitely not recommend this place or every go back.", "author": "Matthew Y."}

I GOT A HEADACHE AND FELT AWFUL after eating the nasty food here.  the waitress was so rude. when my boyfriend asked if they had bento boxes like it was pictured on window outside she got mad and started rushing our order.  i will never eat here again.  and when we asked for a extra plate they kind of hesitant to give us one. so dont go here. you wont like it here. for better service just walk down the block and up the hill abit to sushi rock. its alot better there and the service is better.", "author": "cristina t."}

If you go do not sit at a table, instead, sit at the counter, and watch the food float by, when you see what you want, pick it up.  Pay close attention to the plates, that is how you are charged.  For example my son ate $16 worth of shrimp in just a few minutes.  All in all a decent place.", "author": "Chad M."}

I had some take-out food (from elsewhere) and I was passing by here when I realized the other place didn't give me any utensils. I stopped in and asked if I could have a plastic fork or a set of those disposable chopsticks. The assholes inside were VERY rude and condescending, like I was trying to steal from them. They were rude as hell even to Chinatown standards, and that REALLY says something about the place.", "author": "Tony L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-03-08", "description": "this is a negative star... I feel this place is only in business due to location and tourists stumbling in. The place has no customer service, place is dirty and I feel the hostess plays dumb to cheat people out of things. She hardly looked at us when we came in and just said sit wherever. I had to flag her down to order two soda's. The prices aren't that great compared to what you are getting, small portions. The crumbled jello on the floor was just as amusing to look at as the hot dog that kept circling around on the sushi boat. It had this glossy look to it. Not sure what they coated it with but it was worth taking pictures. After eating two california rolls and realizing the order of edamame was never coming (after 20+ minutes) we left. I had to go up to the counter and tell her I was done. As she failed to read the cues that I was done and ready to get out of there. Don't go here, its a waste of time (especially if you are paying for parking). There is better food, friendlier service to be found. These people are meant for a food court or a highschool cafeteria.", "author": "Heather C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-03-09", "description": "This place sucks. It's terrible quality. Terrible service. Terrible sushi. Terribly overpriced. After a few hours walking in Chinatown, I was hungry for a snack. When I wandered in, the sushi boat had nothing good on it, but the waitress told me to ask the sushi chef lady to make me something that i wanted. i wrongly assumed she'd make me 3 pieces on the sushi boat plates. Instead, I get a plate with 6 pieces that were so overladen with mayonnaise that they were inedible. 3.95 for a california roll. 9.95 for the \"special\" shrimp tempura roll that was really a mayonnaise roll. And, $1.00 for tea. With tax, it was $15.10 for 8 pieces of sushi (1 boat roll, 1 \"special\" roll. I even asked the woman, \"It's $9.95 for this shrimp roll?\" She obviously didn't care. Used to ripping people off. Isn't she ashamed to be serving shitty food at ridiculous prices. Anyhow, they need to take their 99c sushi flyers out of the window and replace them with $9.95 flyers. I didn't leave them a tip. And, I don't think I've ever done that before. I'd like to give this place 0 stars. Avoid this place if you're walking around in Chinatown and get hungry. Don't make the mistake that I did. Blech.", "author": "Maren P."}

Most of the dishes on the float have been circulating for quite a while. Very little choices on sushi....there are way too many crappy chinese dim sum. our theory is that some of the stuff went to dim sum in the morning and packed some left-overs and served them in the restaurant....\n\nsushi: little choice, not fresh and not cheap.\nservice: terrible. we went in around 7pm Sat nite. the staff were eating dinner!! no one was there to serve us. we sat there for 40min, no one ever added a new sushi dish.  we ended up ordering a Udon which wasn't good at all.", "author": "Kitty L."}
