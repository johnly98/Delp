So pretty and so delicious. Perfectly cooked with crispy edges. \n\nAlso beef short ribs with mashed potatoes and more celery root garnish. Succulent! Try the Tunisian baklava too.

I was having wine with a friend and engrossed in deep conversation when we heard the clamor of dishes midway through our conversation. It was loud enough that our conversation stopped and we looked at the bar. I guess they were cleaning up some dishes - totally understandable - so we went on, talking.\n\nThe unfortunate and puzzling thing is that this noise/clamor did not stop for the next 20-30 minutes we were there. It was as if whoever was cleaning and arranging the dishes in plain view behind the bar was in a bad or angry mood and purposely clanging the dishes together while putting them away. Once or twice the guys behind the bar even caught us looking their way - it should have been evident that we were being disturbed - but they kept on with their loud chores. This was one of the more bizarre scenes I've been around. We eventually left to find another place to talk.", "author": "Mohammed M."}

Don't be intimidated by not knowing what Tunisian food is!! Think the most delicious, moist cous cous you've ever tasted, with so much flavor!! And the chicken...unique spices...not overpowering or too spicy. I ordered the deviled eggs as an app. The best part was how the owner told me how to eat them: cut them in half first!! I was about to eat them whole first. They are slightly spicy...but well worth it & the BEST deviled eggs I've ever tasted. Go out of your comfort zone & try this place!!

I believe his name is Rafik and who humiliated us and treated so poorly.\n\nThe place was very busy, so its understandable that he was rushed to take our order. However, when we asked for his help to order he refused to help and was very aggressive and shoved the menu in my face. Mind you, we had been there the previous day and decided that we wanted to come back and give them more of our valuable business. Why I wanted his help if we had been here the previous day you may ask, very simple I wanted to try something different and was hoping to enjoy a nice meal here.\n\nInstead, he refused to give me any insight into their menu and rushed me to order the same thing I had ordered the previous day. A few minutes later we sat down at our table which was very dirty. By then he was no longer busy so I signaled him to make our table more presentable and wipe it down. As I did this I whispered to my friend that the host did not help me with the menu and pretty much forced me to order something I had already tried. \n\nHe overhead what I said and raised his voice and said he would give us our money back and wanted us out of the restaurant. My jaw dropped, I was never disrespectful and was only stating the truth. \n\nI'm convinced that this was a serious case of discrimination and racism!\n\nI will never return here, and will make sure to let others know about my experience here.", "author": "Soguis H."}

The owner/server was very personable and gracious - let us try the wine before we purchased - and helped us decide what to order. Started with the cheese plate (served on a beautiful olive wood board) - a nice display of 3 delicious cheeses, toast, dates, honey, almonds and fresh raspberries and the spicy seafood stew. The stew was tasty, but wish it came with some additional bread to soak up the flavorful sauce. \n\nBetween 3 of us, we tried the Beef Short Ribs with truffled mashed potatoes, Lamb Shank w/ vegetables, and the fresh Red Snapper with mushrooms, celery root and lemon cream sauce. ALL delicious, perfectly prepared and beautifully presented. We were all pleasantly surprised - prices also very reasonable for San Francisco.

I went there for breakfast, ordered small coffee and veggie omlet with roasted potatoes. Coffee looked like dirt water so I didn't even drank it.

I paid 20$ including tip and didn't eat had to go to another place to eat.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-02-15", "description": "I have eaten at La Marsa four times in the past three months. This will be a long review as I want to share about each experience, but from the start I want to encourage you to try this place. I have traveled in many countries, eaten in many restaurants, and have had excellent food, but La Marsa has touched me for two reasons-unique, high quality food with fresh ingredients and connection. The first time I ate here was when I was with my husband and another couple. We were staying near Union Square in December 2017. We asked the staff at the hotel for a breakfast recommendation, they suggested La Marsa. When we saw that they served buckwheat crepes with lamb sausage we could hardly believe our eyes. I am a baker and my husband is a chef; we don't eat out often because we make such great food at home, but this was something we knew we would not be making at home! \n\nMy husband and I shared the La Marsa crepe, the flavors were subtle, but so delicious-the cumin balanced nicely with the spiciness of the sofrito sauce. The crepe was accompanied by a lightly dressed small salad of fresh greens. There was plenty for the two of us to share, though I would have been happy to eat it all myself! My Americano was excellent, bold without being bitter. \n\nOur companions got the Shakshouka and an omelette, both were thoroughly enjoyed. I tasted the Shakshouka, the eggs were baked to perfection and the ratatouille was flavorful, the combination with the chickpeas and sofrito sauce was excellent. In my book, many restaurants ruin omelettes-either by overcooking or adding too much cheese. Our friend said her omelette was delicious and again very flavorful. \n\nI knew I would be returning to Union Square for a week in San Francisco with my sister in February. I couldn't wait to introduce her to La Marsa. We came for breakfast on Wednesday.  We shared the La Marsa savory lamb crepe and then followed up with a sweet crepe with bananas and Nutella. The savory crepe was a treat once again, even better than I remembered. The sweet crepe which is also gluten free, but made from a gluten free flour blend instead of the buckwheat, was lighter and every bit delicious in its own way. The greater treat that morning was meeting Rafik the owner. We talked about food, culture, dreams, community, and life. He is very committed to giving you not just excellent fare, but a wonderful experience as well. This is also when we found out that La Marsa was open for dinner. \n\nWe returned on Thursday for dinner, the restaurant was transformed. What was an inviting cafe, was now a warm, intimate space. The mood was set with candlelight and low overhead lighting. We started with the Tunisian deviled eggs with shrimp, then shared the Cumin crusted Red Snapper and Braised Short Ribs. Everything was perfection! The flavor combinations, the tenderness of the meat, the crunchy outside of the fish with the tangy lemon cream sauce. I had never tasted anything like it. Despite Rafik acting as waiter and chef, he still took time out to make sure we were enjoying our meal and shared some more of his passion about his food and his place. Of course we had to get dessert-the Affogato and the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e were both delicious. I am not a big fan of creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, but Rafik's made me a believer. \n\nWe were leaving on Friday and decided we needed one more opportunity to enjoy La Marsa, so we went back for breakfast. Though, we know everything would be worthy of trying, we didn't want to miss out on our savory lamb crepe and decided we needed a repeat of the sweet crepe with Nutella and banana too. Another excellent Americano rounded out my breakfast and we said goodbye to our newfound friend, looking forward to our next time in San Francisco and especially our next time at La Marsa.", "author": "Bliss B."}

I think they make crepes during the day. At night they serve a few appetizers and a few main dishes. We tried a little of both - the cheese plate and the tuna appetizer were delicious and the right size for two people to share. If you're more hungry try the lamb! The host and everyone working here is very friendly and talkative. You'll feel welcome and it's easy to leave after two or three glasses of wine, even if you came in just for one.

I hadn't even looked at any reviews, I kind of picked the place based on instinct and a glance at the menu and atmosphere. My friend and I had the Tunisian deviled eggs, and then the snapper and short rib entrees (along with whatever wine rec they gave us, which was also perfect and well-paired). I spent a long time living in NYC/that area, and before that, various places across the globe, and likewise have eaten at a wide array of memorable places. Somehow it took my experience at La Marsa (well, and a few other good recent tries) to FINALLY inspire me to start writing Yelp reviews, lol. I was just *that* charmed by this place -- in all respects, the highlight of which, of course, was the food; I feel like there's not much I could say to really do it justice, other than to fiercely recommend it!! The head chef (it's a really small staff here, I believe it's usually just him and then the owner/chef who do the cooking AND serving -- but no worries, service is quick and attentive) is lovely and truly passionate about this food and about the experience La Marsa offers. The food would bring me back regardless of how I felt about the rest of it, but, fortunately, the atmosphere and service were as unbeatable as the food.

The salmon was moist and so was the egg.\n\nMy friend ordered the La Marsa and I tried some of it; also very filling and meaty.\n\nThe price is VERY worth it. I got my crepe at 11.50 plus my 1.75 soda, plus tax was around 14 dollars. I've had crepes that costed more and weren't as good.  This didn't disappoint.", "author": "Maya L."}

The deviled eggs and bruschetta were like nothing else I've ever had, and the braised short ribs with mashed potatoes melted in my mouth like butter!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-12-07", "description": "I don't often look for a restaurant near Union Square. For the most part, it's a very touristy part of town.  However, Christmas activities brought us to this busy part of the city and while waiting for a table at a nearby restaurant with a 40-minute wait, I peeked into La Marsa and found it's intimate and warm interior to be just the right fit for us. I was thrilled to give it a try once I read the reviews and they proved to be entirely correct. Beautiful, thoughtful food served by the owner who is as gorgeous as his food (seriously!). Very attentive service without being intrusive and a limited menu that focuses on quality, rather than quantity: rich and comforting, I loved my tender short rib served over a very creamy truffle mashed potato. My friend had the lamb shank which was quite generous and we both ate every morsel while still managing to save room for dessert. La Marsa is about to turn one, and I hope more people come to discover this very special restaurant with Tunisian roots. If you are looking for a sweet restaurant that offers a superb meal prior to a show at the Curran, consider trying La Marsa. You'll be glad you did.", "author": "Jill S."}

So tasty and surprising. \nFor the entree, I had the short ribs with truffle mashed potatoes and red wine and beer reduction... Yep, it's as amazing as it sounds. Full of flavor, the meat is perfectly cooked. \nI also tried my mother's lamb riblets; melts in the mouth and the pesto is delicious, as well as my husband's mergez plate; so good and fresh-tasting. And also, all dishes are beautifully presented! \nThe wine list is great and the owner is here to give you some advice on what to pair with your food. \nThe only downside is quantity, some of the entrees are missing a little side... but after the delicious dessert (vanilla ice cream, crushed almonds and you pour an expresso on top), we were all nicely full! \nWe will definitely be back in this little gem. \nDuring the day it's apparently a completely different experience with a different menu (coffee, croissant, crepes).
