Both employees were very helpful and friendly. However the actual dining experience was rather unexceptional. The lamb on my kebab was poorly seasoned, burnt, and very dry. It felt like eating college dining hall grilled chicken all over again, if I wanted that, I could've just stayed for summer school. The sides and condiments were ok, nothing too special with the hummus or the salad, and the rice was decently cooked. For 15 dollars, this meal definitely has a lot but be warned it may leave your mouth drier than the Sahara!", "author": "Andy J."}

As I sat at a table in The Chapel, grumpy that they weren't serving food that night, I realized I needed dinner. With a concert set to start in a few minutes, time was short.\n\nWe had passed Ali Baba's on the way to the concert venue, and as hungry as I was, the smell nearly overcame me. Now it could no longer be resisted. Wifey in tow, we set off.\n\nTwo shwarma sandwiches were ordered and came loaded with hummus, fries (!), veggies, and spicy paste. Extra spicy for me, please! Piles of lamb were sliced from the terrifying yet hypnotic meat cylinder of awesome, it was wrapped in lavosh, and grilled. \n\nI've already admitted that i was hungry at that point. (past 9pm, and I hadn't eaten lunch or dinner). But I absolutely INHALED that thing. Not because I was hungry, but because it was DELICIOUS. Grilling the sliced meat after slicing gave each piece a nice seared crust, but was still juicy and tender inside. Hot condiment used was really good, gave the shwarma a nice heat that I really enjoyed.\n\nBy the time I was done (less than five minutes!) my hunger was sated. I went back to the concert a happy man, and enjoyed the show. Slightly disappointed that when I came back out, they were closed because I would have really been tempted to go back for another one.\n\nIs it perfect? Nope. But a damn tasty spot in a place where your other option is one of 5,000 burrito joints.", "author": "Gary E."}

My stomach was aching with hunger after a long road trip, and I only looked for the cheapest looking, somewhat appetizing food to satisfy this hunger. Wow, did I get more than that! \n\nAs soon as I walked in, I was greeted with fierce \"hello's!\" from the workers, and my eye immediately went to the subway-style bar with the cooked lamb in the back. \nI ordered the Chicken Shararma (I typically avoid dark meat), and watched as the fresh hummus, steak fries, combination of potatoes and peppers were lathered on the tortilla type bread. As she rolled it up, my mouth began to water at the though of putting the freshly cooked season chicken concoction in my mouth. To make things even better, she put the whole thing in an PANINI PRESS. DAMN what a great greek burrito (as I like to call it). I could only finish half of the $10 meal, and I stayed full for the rest of my day in San Francisco. Highly recommend if you need a single meal to both satisfy your tastebuds and keep you full for most (if not the entire) day.\n\nAlso for tourists! The eatery is only a few blocks from Dolores Park.

No matter how many falafels get stuffed in my face, I will always have an unceasing craving for more. \n\nAnd I blame this fiery love of falafels on genetics (of course). My father has been fervidly feeding my falafel addiction since I was a wee young'n, and amid the wide selection of Mediterranean cuisine in the bay area, Ali Baba's has always been our favorite place for that good good, hands down. I honestly have a hard time trying other places because I've already found perfection at Ali Baba's.\n\nThey earn a dazzling five stars in my book because, well...\n\n*FALAFELS are the bombdizzles. Try it try it try it. They're huge and delicious! Definitely worth the moolah. One bite and you'll look like that one emoji with the heart eyes, yadamean. \n\n*The WRAPS are made to order right in front of your very eyes (O.O) You can let them know exactly what you want, or don't want, inside of your magical creation! No hot sauce? Extra red onions? No problem. The homies at Ali Baba's gotchu covered.\n\n*Everything is S P R E A D so evenly it's ridiculous. None of that sloppy nonsense. It's amazing.  Plenty of eggplant, potatoes, tabouleh, hot sauce, hummus, tahini and falafel throughout the entire wrap. Major props, Ali Baba.\n\n*Their beef, chicken, and lamb are solid choices. The beef is well marinated and tender. The chicken and lamb aren't super juicy, but not dry either. I personally think the beef/lamb combo is the best choice among the three.\n\n*Such friendly servers. They're always happy to move a table and a set of chairs outside for us when I bring my doggy with me.\n\n*Fast service! Shouldn't take more than ten minutes to grab a quick bite, even with a line of customers. Yee!\n\nBottom line.\n\nI heart falafels. Especially from Ali Baba's.

For some reason, the majority of the restaurants in the area have decided that shutting their doors at 10pm is a good plan. I'm glad that ABC has resisted that trend. The second is that their portions are large, and their food is good. In the arena of quick, filling, and reasonably priced meals, ABC stands toe-to-toe with the local burrito joints, and often emerges from the fray as the hummus-y champion. They make their falafels from scratch too, so if they're fresh they are amazing.", "author": "Guru K."}

It was nice to finally know where he got these wonderful delights.  Starting of with a fresh tabouleh salad.  For me I think the food was amazing!!! It is a must eat asap, They grill the falafel and lamb shawarma. The grill marks allows for a nice little texture and a smokey flavor on the soft wrap.  There is a slight heat that touches that back of your throat which does not over power the flavor of the wrap.  The falafel was surely fresh, crunchy and soft on the inside.  I am a tru carnivorous man at heart, but this meal surely gave a satisfying alternative.  \n\nThe atmosphere could do a little revamping, but it sure as hell does not take that much away from the flavor of the food and the great love placed in each wrap they made.

I was right, my chicken was dry and I got to a point in the kebab where I thought 'ok, I cant do the rest. \n\nThe chips were dry and not crispy enough and I can taste the deep fryer fat is not clean.

They weren't anything special but they complimented the rest of the wrap quite well. The overall flavor was good but not enough to bump it up to #1 on my falafel list. What was keeping it from perfection may have been the dryness of it all put together. A little more hummus and this thing woulda been nearly perfect. Oh, and while I could see that parts of my wrap had been stained red by the hotsauce, I couldn't really taste it. Since I'm seeking perfection here, I would prefer more girth than length (get your mind outta the gutter folks lol) when it comes to the size of the wrap.

They said sure, and I gave them my credit card on the phone and asked to be charged now, for delivery.\n\nThis was to be a delivery to some friends, as a thank-you for their help to fix my computer.  It was a surprise. I knew they would like it, because there's 9 of them in a collective-living-working situation, and there's always hungry, busy people there.\n\n30 minutes after the time I gave Ali Baba's, I was heading for BART to meet my girlfriend, when they called asking where was I to pick up? I explained that there must be some mistake, but they would not deliver.\n\nI was in a hurry and biked there to pick up. The party tray was a flimsy plastic thing, that wanted to cave in when I picked it up, with the weight of the food inside.  It would have broken in half if I tried to wheel it home on my bike. It would have been OK with a box. I asked for a box and they said they didn't have one, with a bit of attitude.\n\nI wasted 10 min running across street to beg for a box. When I got back, they magically had found one. It was such a waste of time. \n\nI can understand if there might have been miscommunication on the phone (and told them so), but then when they gave me attitude about something as simple as finding a box, that was ridiculous.  \n\nI was in a rush when they called me and wasted my time. This experience soured the nice surprise I was trying to give my friends. But the party tray of hummus, falafel and tabbouleh was very well received.

The clear star of this place, as with most mediterranean places in the city, is the shawerma, but this place has a few unique ingredients.\n\nFirst, fried eggplant. If you haven't had it before, it may be a bit different, but it's quite savory and adds a nice texture. They also put hummus, quality hummus, that doesn't overpower the dish. French fries are next on the unconventional ingredients list, and while they aren't quite the type you'd eat on their own, they do add to the overall heartiness of the wrap. They also add a mediterranean salad with tomatoes, cucumber, and some kind of yogurt sauce, which lightens up the other heavy ingredients nicely (including the spicy sauce, which I highly recommend!).\n\nI didn't mention the meat since, frankly, it's not the superstar of the bunch.

Also recommend no eggplant if you hate eggplant (duh :P) else you'll be unpleasantly surprised.\n\nThe balls are usually crispy outside, chewy inside, but not very spicy.  What is spicy is their harissa sauce, so if your tummy can't handle spicy foods very well or /if you are drunk/ you want to ask for no spicy.  The bread is lavash -- which they grill till flakey, not pita. They paint the inside with hummus, tabouleh and their own version of tzatziki.  Their tabouleh is tasty but it perhaps adds a little too much parsley?  This wouldn't be a problem if they used more lemon juice in the tabouleh to balance it but alas, you can't even taste the lemon which is a total fail IMO.  Felafel needs to have a bright flavor apart from green herbs, a sour, some zing!  But, the lack of lemon flavor is nothing different from most felafels in SF save for Haig's. /sigh\n\nThe alcove they call the cave is cute and a fun place to sit with friends.  \n\nThe shawermas are good but if you can make yourself stumble over to Mission and up another 8 block or so to Old Jerusalem, you can get better shawerma.", "author": "Ben S."}

I love that you can put fries and eggplant into a falafel wrap because it takes this creation to a whole new level.\nThe inside is pretty cute and clean, and I've never had an issue finding a seat.\n\nOn the other hand:\nMy body hates this place! The first time I went here, I had to rush home after I was done eating so I could spend some quality time with my toilet. I then vowed to never eat here again because I felt so shitty, but since their wraps are so delicious, I started having cravings and had to give in. So I ate here again and alas, my body was not happy with me.\n\nFinal verdict: Now I know that I must plan accordingly on when to eat here, which is going to be very rarely because I don't like feeling sick.\n\nI'll stick to La Med for falafel that won't kill my insides.", "author": "Amanda M."}

Several months after coming back home from my stay, my sister asks if I wanted a shwarma. Apparently, she found this place while I was studying abroad and couldn't get enough of it. So I got a lamb shwarma and it just brought back all those great memories of hanging out with my friends abroad... then again, so do the Dutch caramel wafers from Starbucks and Trader Joe's.\n\nAfter moving out of my parents' house, I had only had one or two shwarmas, but not from here. A couple of months ago, I needed to get out of the apartment, so I called up my sister and I hung out in the Mission with her. Long story short, we came here because for some reason, I wanted a shwarma. Out of all the choices I had on Mission and Valencia, I'm glad I came here. \n\nThe lamb shwarma was just really good. The people making it were pretty cool as well. I had never ate here since we always had take out before. The place looks like a hole-in-the-wall, but luckily, I love these places. It wasn't crowded with people and I didn't see any bugs crawling around.\n\nSo, I've never been to Old Jerusalem and I haven't had their falafel yet, so I can't compare Ali Baba's to the other place, or any other in the City. It's not as good as the restaurants I've been to in Amsterdam, but that could just be nostalgia talking. Personally, I really like this place and if I ever come back to the Mission, this is definitely a top option.", "author": "Chris S."}

I ordered mine without the potatoes but I asked for the tahini and he asked me, \"what was that?\"...i said \"tahini\" , so he asked the server to add to this to  his too.\n\nWe ordered our juice drinks, mango then we were served the food. Like always, we said grace, i love it when he leads the prayer. The shawerma was huge, like your super burrito, but it was good. All the flavors came together.

I ordered the fallafel platter, and my boyfriend the lamb platter. It was tasty enough and was actually quite ffilling. \n\nAbout an twenty minutes after leaving the restaurant, we both felt bloated and heavy in our stomachs. Assuming we had just over-eaten, we both passed out and fell asleep. At about 3:30AM I woke up with a sudden urge to relieve myself on the toilet. Ten minutes of diarreah later, I began throwing up. I continued to throw up for the next twelve hours, every 1 1/2 hours or so, in between which time I had musle aches and spasms, and a fever of 100 degrees F. My boyfriend had diarreah as well for the entire next day.\n\nThe next day I suffered from more stomach cramps and diarreah. Today is the third day since eating at Ali Baba's Cave, and I am somewhat back to normal, though I could hardly sleep last night due to my stomach turning and aching.\n\nI have never had such a violent reaction to food. I have called the CDC and the San Francisco Department of Public Health Food Poisioning Department to remedy the problem. I can only assume that others who ate there on Sunday night, had a similarly horrendous experience. I only wish restaurants would be more conscious of these types of issues. \n\nDo not eat here.

Not knowing a lot about Greek food, I chose what seemed easiest--Falafel.\n\nIt was huge & quite yummy! My pal Scott and I realized that we should have split a Falafel instead of purchasing our own & leaving the leftovers on a trashcan outside for the Mission' homeless and/or hungry population.\n\nThe sandwich (or should I call it a burrito) itself was not too spicy, I actually would have liked it with a little more punch. Perhaps this is something you can ask for when ordering? I will try it next time.\n\nService was plain & simple--the counter person wasn't very friendly, but not much should be expected in this type eating environment.\n\nThis eatery has a great selection of soda pop--all from some obscure company and great tasting.\n\nI'm giving it four stars because I assume there is a better Falafel (at least for me) out there, but the amount of food you get for the price is righteous.", "author": "matt m."}

People were milling about more than usual, just like after the Loma Prieta earthquake. Natural weather events spark people's need to have comfort food and my desire that day was to have a lamb shawarma. The place was pretty crowded with other like-minded folks thinking - we need comfort from the storm (all the power outages and fallen tree branches!)\n\nI usually go to Truly Mediterranean, but I think Friday is their chicken shawarma day and I wanted lamb so I came here. \n\nI ordered the said lamb shawarma and a side of humous. The shawarma was huge and very meaty. Very lamby tasting, more so than Truly Mediterranean. The humous was good but I like it more garlicy than they make it. They put more stuff in the shawarma than others I've had, but that doesn't really make it better, just bigger. \n\nI still think I like Truly Mediterranean better, but this place was good and satisfying, just different. from TM.

Because they were such a dietary staple for me, I began to crave them all the time. And, when I got back to the states, I still wanted them, but had the hardest time finding kebabs that approximated the ones in New Zealand.\n\nI am happy to say that the shawarma wraps at Ali Baba's are the closest that I have found in California. They are really delicious and you can easily get two meals out of them. If you like spicy food, be sure to ask for hot sauce -- it really makes the wrap delicious.  Service can be a little slow and the fries in the wrap take some getting used to. Ifyou are feeling bad about being unhealthy or don't like the fries substitute them for eggplant.

My friend and I were hoping to have a quick dinner in the neighborhood and Ali Baba's seemed like a perfectly good, fast alternative to Mexican food.  We ordered, waited 45 minutes for our food in vain, asked where our food was twice, and finally ended up walking out an hour later with our food in plastic bags.  The staff there was unapologetic and unresponsive.  I wish I could say it was just a mistake and lack of customer service, but the staff there just didn't seem to put effort into anything.  \n\nThe inside of Ali Baba's is *disgustingly* dirty.  All available seating is filthy and shabby in that about-to-breakdown sort of way.  During my wait, I looked over at the wall next to me and realized the walls were not only dirt/smoke covered but also STAINED with caked on sauces that customers had spilled.  There were literally globs of crusted sauce on the walls.  It was just downright foul.  I spent the rest of my frustrating wait trying to avoid looking at the inside of the restaurant.  Note to self: never go to a \"cave\" to eat -- they have caveman standards for cleanliness.\n\nWhen I finally bit into my lamb shish kebab sandwich at home an hour later, I couldn't help but notice that the chunks of lamb, onion and vegetables were way too big.  The sandwich itself was a good generous size but seriously, how much extra time does it take to cut ingredients into decent size cubes?", "author": "Fanzi P."}

But without getting into the why's and WTF's of that, I'd like to tell you about the inexplicable wait and terrible food.\n\nThe man behind the counter was really very nice to me. I will admit that not being familiar with the menu, and being awfully hungry, I was in a rush to order the first thing that came to mind. After having a delicious lamb kebab down the street earlier in the week, I was craving something similar, though now I realize I should have gone for the falafel.\n\nHe told me it would take 15 minutes to cook the lamb. OK, sure, no prob. I didn't think that kind of a wait sounded too terrible, considering it was the first time all day I'd had to relax and have some \"me and my iphone\" time.\n\n45 minutes later I wasn't so thrilled. About 10 different people came in and stayed no longer than 10 minutes for their food. Granted, they were ordering falafel, but really - what kind of lamb had I ordered? Did they actually have to raise and slaughter the poor dear in the back? They guy was being really nice about it and I didn't complain, but inside my blood was boiling.\n\nI finally got the effin lamb kebab in a wrap, took it home and expected to savor the most delicious lamb I'd ever had in my life, in front of my beloved TV with yet another HORRIBLE episode of Heroes - wtf are they doing with that show?\n\nTo the point: the food was terrible. I couldn't finish it, rather I didn't want to finish it. The lamb was dry and extremely tough, with peppers that burned my lips. Too many onions - I really thought for a second I had ordered the onion wrap.\n\nI want to go back and try the falafel. It did look delicious.", "author": "Zara E."}

It took about an hour and a half to finish and will definitely require some pant adjusting. I don't recommend the fries as a side- it's was overcooked, soggy and oily. it's usually one of the ingredients in the wrap and it's better that way.\n\nMy usual is the falafel and the lamb schwerma which are both really good and hella filling (yes I'm from the Bay Area). The falafel is spicy and the lamb is good quality meat. \n\nIf you're jonesing for a baklava, theirs is pretty good albeit expensive ($2 for a small serving). It's light, flaky and not too sweet.

Also, my brother's name is Ali so my friend though it would be humorous since I had just mentioned him.  Wee had the luxury of being able to sit in the small \"cave\", so it was quite a neat experience. \n\nThe main attraction here is there shawarma sandwich made with a large lavash bread, resulting in a large wrap the size of a Chipotle burrito.  THIS WAS AWESOME.  I've never seen shawarma done like this, so my hungry belly was quite enthused.\n\nI think the whole Chipotle-ness of it could be worked better and they could adopt the assembly line format where you get to pick your ingredients rather than a bunch of premade mishmashes (the toppings were scooped from containers, anyways).  Absolutely loved the fact that they put the fries IN THE SANDWICH, which was amazing.\n\nI got the Ali Baba Special ($7.50), which was well worth the price.  It was stuffed with chicken, turkey, grilled veggies, and FRENCH FRIES.  That's right, they put the fries in the sandwich which was definitely the coolest thing about this place.  Amazing street food convenience. \n\nThe toppings were a bit soggy, though, and the meat, well, a little dry and bland.  Kind of wish the sauce was less water and had a bit more flavor too it as well.   My whole sandwich ended up falling apart, which sucked, but I mean I still ate it all.  Could have easily split this into two meals but I'm a beast like that.  \n\nThis place is definitely worth trying but I won't be back too many more times unless they make some changes.  Follow the Chipotle model for a big-ass shawarma with fresher ingredients, more customization, and less shiesty service and this place could be a real trend-setting winner.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-02-02", "description": "Judging from some of the other Yelp! reviews, this restaurant has some sanitary/cleaning issues.  Here's my story.\n\nIn December 2008 I brought my out-of-town brother and a friend of his to experience some falafel and shwarma.  I ordered my falafel first and am sure glad I did.  After the gentleman behind the counter made my wrap, he proceeded to replace the shwarmas behind him with new ones.  Then he made my brother's, and his friend's, wrap.\n\nThe problem here?  He replaced the cooked chicken with raw chicken WITH HIS BARE HANDS and then proceeded to touch, with those hands, every single ingredient that went into my brother's wrap.  There was no hand washing, sanitizing, or even wiping them on a towel.\n\nAlthough we watched this with horror, we didn't speak up.  My brother and his friend ate their shwarmas and miraculously didn't get sick afterwards.  Although I had a vegetarian dish, it seems quite likely that raw chicken was probably on the cook's hands before he made mine.  \n\nTherefore, I will never return to any Ali Baba's again.  Although you get a lot of food for a good price, the sanitary issues with this establishment just aren't worth it.  Try Truly Mediterranean instead.  So far, they've washed their hands after touching raw meat.", "author": "Joanne G."}

When asked 'with everything', I wasn't expecting to find chewy fries and charred eggplant in my sandwich. Nor was I expecting to be told that it was going to be 50 cent extra. When I said I wanted 'everything that is in a regular falafel sandwich', the answer was: 'the eggplant is already in it now'. Good thing someone else behind the bar told her to take the 50c off again. Didn't like the eggplant or the fries one bit though.

I will be fair and preface this by saying that I recently traveled in the Middle East, and I am comparing their food to the EXCELLENT falafel that I had there.  Still, this place's falafel is incredibly disappointing. How difficult is it to serve things in FRESH pita and how hard is it to actually sell FRESH falafel that is not tasteless and whose texture does not make it seem that it has been sitting there for several days!? Two last comments, also not positive - if you're watching your profit margin, just raise the price of your wraps a bit and don't nickel and dime people if they ask for a bit more hummus or something. Again, maybe I'm unfairly comparing them to the places I tried abroad but, come on, just give me some damn baba ganoush without informing me that it's 50 cents extra!  And, finally, the service here is terrible.  Allow me to dispel the belief, Ali Baba employees/owners: you are not doing ME a favor by serving me! In fact, I can only assume that your food is not at all fresh & is sitting out all day because your customer base is lacking!", "author": "SL N."}

I'm a mellow guy who let's mistakes happen, but when do the same thing repeatedly, it's simple dishonesty.\nHere's how the scam works:\nYou ask for a falafel. There is no description anywhere on any menu of what comes on the falafel. They start to make it and ask you if you want fries and eggplant on it. You say sure. They hand you the falafel and ring you up at the cash register. Lo and behold, it's almost a dollar more than the printed price for a falafel. You say, \"but the menu says $X.XX?\" They say, \"But you ordered a super.\" But I didn't order a super, and there isn't even a \"super\" on the damn menu! Of course, by that point, you feel that, well, they already made the thing and you don't want them to throw it away, so you just pay up and take it. Everyone just pays the extra rather than making a big deal about it, and these guys take in many extra bucks a day from chumps like us.\n\nWell, this happened once. I went back a couple months later. Same thing happened. Then I was determined to give them one more chance to prove they weren't corrupt. I went back again a couple months later. I was very careful with what I said and explicit that I just wanted a plain falafel, just like it says on the menu. They never tell you that fries and eggplant cost extra (and it's not printed anywhere), they just non-chalantly ask you if you want some, as if it were a burrito place asking what kind of beans you want. It's fine to charge more for \"extras.\" It's another to not disclose to people that these are extras and pretend they're not until you ring it up. Of course, the exact same thing happened. Not only that, but it was like $1.50 more this time. His explanation was that they didn't have the \"current\" increased prices on the menu board yet. I called him on it. He started raising his voice and saying that \"no one else complains.\"\nWell, everyone else isn't paying attention.\nI hope they've mended their ways, but if they haven't, watch out and call them on it.", "author": "josh s."}

I love fried food, but if you're going to indulge in the extra calories and fat grams it needs to be out of the fryer fresh. In NYC and Paris' Jewish Quarter I've eaten falafel that is the pinnacle of falafel-ness. They key to their tastiness is that they fry the falafel to order. The hot and crispy falafel balls contrast with cool tahini, crisp lettuce and creamy hummus to create something so simple, yet complex at the same time. In San Francisco, the cook a ton of falafel's ahead of time, nuke them then serve them in a wrap (which should really be a fresh pita)....all of the fat and calories of a made to order falafel, but not fresh from the fryer crunch and heat. Since falafels cook in under 3 minutes, they could be doing it right. It really is a shame, since SF street/etcnic food for the most part is terrific. They just cannot do falafel right....for falafel perfection, go to Mamoun's in NYC or New Haven, CT.", "author": "Matt H."}
