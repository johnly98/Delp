The scene is quiet in Chinatown: not many tourists or locals, just a few of us who either have the day off or are done with work already.  After having lunch in North Beach, I was craving an egg tart.  Hoping to win the lottery and catch this place open, I started walking towards the bakery. (Pro tip:  do not attempt to drive directly into Chinatown.  Park in one of the nearby garages or take public transportation.  The streets in this hood are too narrow and too busy with pedestrians to make it worth your while).  \n\nJackpot!!! Golden Gate Bakery was open AND there were only a handful of customers inside.  I was served right away, with everything at my fingertips.  If I wasn't already full, I probably would have bought out all the goodies (which would not have been smart, since I was walking/bussing around).  The lady at the counter wanted me to get everything, but I chose 4 egg tarts and two sesame balls.  She placed them in a pink box, tied it up with a string, and cut out some holes in the corners (since all the pastries were still warm!).\n\nTo say these items were large would be the understatement of the year.  The sesame balls were as big as a baseball and super tasty!  Just one could be a meal in itself.  And the egg tart was as advertised... the best I've ever had.  The crust was flaky, the filling was warm and luscious, somehow both heavy and light at the same time.  \n\nSomehow, I restrained myself from eating the entire order right on the sidewalk and saved some for my wife.  But next time, I might eat them all myself!\n\nLastly, this place is cash only.  There is an ATM across the street.  And while I was fortunate to not have to deal with the throngs, be ready to wait in line if they happen to be open.", "author": "Jeffrey S."}

Make sure you call the bakery before arriving -- there are some days when they are not open.\n\nEgg Tarts \n- This was the only thing I order, but that's all you need to order. Hands down, these were the best egg tarts I have ever had, and I've tried many many egg tarts throughout my life. The egg tart is truly baked to perfection. The crust is flakey but thick enough to support the egg custard in the middle. The egg custard itself is perfectly sweetened but has some sort of addictive taste to it that makes you just want more of it. Even after leaving it out in the cold for 4 ours it still tasted amazing. It will still taste as amazing even if you reheat it the next day. This place is well worth the hype and I would recommend this to anyone.", "author": "Eric Q."}

The egg custard tarts are obviously amazing, they have the perfect custard consistency, not too sweet but just enough of the eggy goodness. The crust is my favorite part, it's flaky and buttery and melts with the custard beautifully. Definitely a good bake. Sesame balls, get it if you are a fan of those delightful dim sum treats cause you stood in that line so make it worth it. The almond cookie, skip. The mooncakes pretty darn good, I've only had the pineapple and taro. \n\nMy 4 stars...why?!! It's due to the fact that they don't have everything available even when you go the minute they open. I mean..ok fine maybe the oven just didn't want to work properly or some lack of inventory for the week made some baked goods not available but every single (6 times) time there is one item or two not available.

All the other times I have visited here there were no lines but this time it seemed like a good 30-45 minute wait as once the egg tarts come out of the oven, people order them by the dozen and it runs out real quick and the line and wait time gets longer again until the next batch.\n\nMy wife got smart and and asked a very kind lady in front of the line to purchase 2 egg tarts for us because we needed to rush to the airport to catch our flight.  She obliged and we bypassed the line and enjoyed our hot, fresh out of the oven egg tarts in less than 5 minutes wait time (LOL, we did get some evil stares from people who were still waiting in line when they realized what my wife did)!\n\nThe egg tarts are delicious but this is the first time I am able to compare the egg tarts here and at Lido Restaurant in Richmond, BC when both are still fresh in my mind and palate.  Lido wins as Golden Gate is lacking the egg flavor Lido had in its egg tarts.

Proceeded to line up only to learn about 10 mins into waiting that they were NOT selling their famed egg custard tarts, and it turned out they were doing their moon cake special. Ultimately, I decided to stand in line and order some moon cakes to try..I was already there, after all. To be specific, the moon cakes that they sell are the Cantonese variety, not the Taiwanese ones.\n\nUpon getting my foot into the door of the bakery, I could see their extensive moon cake menu. There were so many different fillings and you could choose to have anywhere between 0 to 4 yolks in your mooncake. I ended up getting just two: a white lotus one with 1 yolk and a pineapple one with no yolk.\n\nI definitely like moon cakes and always look forward to the Mid-Autumn Moon Festival, but let's be honest....they're really heavy. Normally, I can maybe eat 1/8th or 1/4th of a moon cake in one sitting and probably be okay for the rest of day. Golden Gate's moon cakes were noticeably lighter than other moon cakes I've eaten. The flavor of the white lotus paste was still sweet, but not cloyingly so. The saltiness of the yolk paired well with it. I especially liked the pineapple moon cake, which is one that I've personally never had until now. The pineapple filling is actually tart and I felt like I could have easily eaten half of it without any regrets.\n\nThe egg custard tarts of Golden Gate Bakery are rightfully legendary, but don't pass up on their moon cakes either when that times comes around!", "author": "Clarice C."}

Honestly, I think it's the high demand and the allure of catching them when they're open. They take random vacations and a lot of the workers here have worked there for decades (one of ladies told me she's been there for 30+ years!)\n\nEgg tarts is their game and yes, they've pretty much perfected it. Will you stand in a long line waiting to grab some? That's the real question. These egg tarts coming out piping out and fresh out of the oven. That's why you're really waiting in that long line - because the shop is TINY and I'm sure only so many trays can be baked. \n\nBut the end result of all your waiting? Deliciousness. Light flakey but crispy crust that's a little buttery but delicious with a creamy custard that's not too overpowering of egg but delicate and light. And that, is just perfection. \n\nI'm going to be honest - I'm biased. I grew up in Hong Kong and grew up on egg tarts. So I love them in general, but golden gate's takes me back to those days in my childhood that I can't find in other egg tarts. \n\nThe egg tarts at $2.50 a pop and honestly, just buy what you're planning to eat. Don't buy 4 dozen, don't buy a dozen just because you've been waiting in that line. Heck, don't even buy them to take home or on a plane or whatever. These things are best eaten when they're fresh out of the oven and any other experience will be lackluster. \n\nNow....the secrets. There's a facebook page that sort of tracks whether the store is open. Use it. Don't call them, don't try to check out their yelp hours. Just look up that facebook. Parking in Chinatown is a hassle so use the facebook! Secondly, if you're planning on ordering a good amount (even like a dozen), you can CALL AHEAD AND SKIP THE LINE! \n\nWhat?! Skipping the line?! Yeah. I didn't know about it either until my last experience where a woman came in and told the workers (Hey, I'm here for my pick up order of XYZ).

Do not let the long lines fool you because it moves rather quickly. \n\nAt $2.50 per egg tart, they are rather pricey. I remember when they were about $0.60 each in NYC's Chinatown. Oh how time flies. Once you're inside, you have the option of purchasing the egg tarts individually or by the dozen. They also offer other Chinese baked goods such as sesame balls, rice cakes, Chinese \"rice crispies\" and moon cakes.\n\nThe rice cakes had a distinct cooking wine aftertaste to them, somewhat sweet and a chewy, airy texture. I'd say try it out if you haven't had it before, but other than that, skip it. \n\nThe famous egg tarts were warm and straight out of the oven when we purchased them. The crust was buttery and flaky and complemented extremely well with the warm egg custard in the middle. One can easily eat 5-6 of these if they wanted to since they were so delectable. \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my first experience here at Golden Gate Bakery.

Hailing from LA, we've got a lot of Hong Kong dim sum restaurants in the 626 but they can't compare to those up in SF. Historically, Chinese immigrants settled up north for the railroads before coming down to LA and I feel like those ancestors established different Chinese cuisine than those down in LA. Not only does it taste different, the people who make them are different. \n\nEnough with the history lesson, let's get down to business. The egg tarts here has a flaky crust all around and an extremely hot core when you take your first bite. I have never tasted any egg tart fresh off the oven and straight into my mouth.

First off, what may be surprising is that they're open and second of all there were only 15 people in front where the line usually goes down the entire block.\n\nAfter a half an hour wait, settled inside the small bakery of strewn boxes and miscellaneous non-bakery related items (Look inside, you'll get what I mean ...) there isn't much-baked goods out in their counter and the egg tarts come out on trays from the back. Decided with a wait, might as well get my money's worth and got 6 egg tarts.\n\nEgg tarts came out piping hot. Smelled delicious and was properly placed in a box and tied. The egg tart smelled and looked beautiful. Nice deep cups, flaky and buttery crust. The egg custard itself, although hot and molten straight out of the oven was not to my liking. I mean, I may have burnt off 50% of my tastebuds by the sheer heat of the damn thing but it was way too water and eggy. I prefer egg tarts that are more set and creamy versus egg and these were exactly the opposite. Nothing against the way they make egg tarts, just personal preference. Ended up eating my egg tart and brought the rest home for the family to consume. They ate the egg tarts but there were no remarks on it being delicious or exponentially better than anything else we've had.\n\nWas lucky enough to happen upon GGB when they were open and with a \"short\" line. Would I wait in line for these egg tarts? Absolutely not. It did knock off an SF \"To Try\" off my list, however.\n\nCASH ONLY", "author": "Janet N."}

Fresh out of the oven and piping hot, the custard is so buttery soft that it melts in your mouth. The crust is flaky and crisp, but also thick and layered to hold all that custard without falling apart. It's sweet but not overpowering like warm milk in your mouth. When they're hot out of the oven, they're amazing. When they're cold, they're still freakin' good.\n\nThis place is always swarming with a line down the block and around the corner. (Because of its popularity, they're constantly making fresh tarts to keep up.) The wait is 100% worth it. We waited close to an hour for the tarts. However many you think you're going to get, get 2 more. Once you've had one, you'll be glad you did. And after waiting that long, you deserve to treat yourself.", "author": "Victoria W."}

There's even a specific fan-made website notifying you if the bakery is open today or not (since the bakery is so popular, the owners tend to go on spontaneous vacations, leaving fans stranded). You'd often find a line out the door with dozens of people waiting at any time but trust me, IT IS SO WORTH IT. \n\nThough there is usually a line coming out the door, the grandmas are really good at hustling people in and out quickly. I only had to wait around 15 minutes with about 10 people waiting in front of me. \n\nSpeaking of which, the grandmas running the shop ARE SO GOOD AT HUSTLIN' YOU, IT'S ALMOST SCARY. There was a Indian family in front of me who were obviously tourists and was asking me what was good there. One of the grandmas overheard them and before I could reply she said briskly, \"Every thing is good\". At the end of their visit, she convinced the family to buy nearly every pastry. I was impressed. \n\nAnyways, back to the food, what they are known for are the heavenly Hong Kong -Style egg tarts. Since this bakery is so popular, you can expect the egg tarts to be fresh any time of the day. It is UH-MAZING. The tart crust is extremely flaky, tender, and buttery. The custard is glassy, smooth as silk, and blow-your-mind good. At $2.25 a pop, these are pretty cheap for the amount of deliciousness you get. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU AT LEAST BUY ONE--- or two --- or 3 -- IF YOU ARE EVER IN THE AREA.", "author": "Julie D."}

I've heard of Golden Gate Bakery from plenty of people but have yet to try it. I decided that this would be the day to embark on a 45 min wait on a Saturday evening to take the chance! \n\nThere's some magic finally walking into the store and seeing the pink bakery boxes, moon cakes and freshly baked egg tarts--like going into a prize show to collect my rewards. Each egg tart was $2.50 and you only get a box if you order 6, otherwise they put 2 in each white paper bag. \nI love sweets and egg tarts aren't new to me, but these are really quite good. And I mean GOOD. You can actually taste the nutty egg, the perfectly balanced crust that's got a good balance of sugar and salt.

Definitely call the store ahead of time since it seems like their operating hours are somewhat random. At first, I was skeptical that the egg tarts here could really be THAT good, but after putting one of these delicious morsels in my mouth, I was made into a true believer.\n\nGolden Gate Bakery's egg tarts are amazing! Fresh from the oven, the custard is silky smooth and ever-so-slightly sweet, while the crust is buttery and flaky with an almost lightly fried texture despite it being baked. At the time of this writing, one egg tart will set you back $2.50 in cash ($30 for a dozen), which is a bit expensive, but I chalk it up as a \"popularity tax\" for being so good. Yes, these really are the best egg tarts you can find on the West Coast!", "author": "Kevin C."}

The vast majority of opinions here seemed to say even though the entire experience getting to the food was terrible it was worth it, and yea it is. Our particular experience wasn't even that bad because we got there around 1pm and it was OPEN!!! If you don't know already there's a website dedicated watch-dogging this place for being open/closed and hours. When we went on Monday they had a sign that they'll open at noon. The line was short but moved slowly, probably took us a good half hour of waiting. \n\nThere is no filming inside the store, and there were two ladies taking orders and wrapping up your food. It's crazy the # of things people buy, I saw a girl walk out with 5 dozen egg tarts! It's pretty reasonably priced since $2.25 each or $27/dozen. We were going to be reasonable and get 6 but decided we'd be stupid not to get a full dozen. We were right, we had a wait a little bit because they were out and we were waiting for the next batch, and it was totally worth it. They also have other items other than egg tarts since they are a bakery, they had amazing looking moon cakes, etc and I ended up getting a sesame ball as well that was filled with red bean paste. The sesame ball was good too just slightly greasy.\n\nThe egg tarts are actually pretty big and it's filled WAY up to the flaky crust. I don't know how but every single egg tart is so perfect and it's truly just beautiful to look at. It's also the PERFECT amount of sweetness and the texture is a firm custard. The crust is nearly indescribable, it's flaky, buttery and perfectly complementary to the custard. Hands down the best egg tart I've certainly ever had in my life and it's ruined me for egg tarts at 85 degrees, etc. Each egg tart was also super filling and though the flakiness disappeared by the next day every single one and bite was absolutely amazing. \n\nSo yeah, I would totally do this again, it's btw a very non descript tiny hole in the wall in Chinatown and there is pretty much no parking.

IF you can get some.\n\nIn the past 6-7 years, I've made 6 trips to San Francisco from Los Angeles and only during ONE of these trips was the freaking bakery even \"officially\" open. I've stood in line for hours when they were \"unofficially\" open - yanno, when they exchange egg tarts and cash through a tiny crack in the door. I've stood in line for an hour in the rain waiting to grab a couple. I've basically seen more \"ON VACATION\" signs than egg tarts. \n\nToday, on my current trip from Wisconsin, my honeymoon of all things, again leaves me disappointed because apparently the owners are on vacation for three WEEKS. My husband hasn't been to SF for a couple of decades and he loves egg tarts. I was so, so, so excited to have him try Golden Gate Bakery's that it was one of the first things to do on our list. \n\nThis place is legitimately a highlight of San Francisco if they can manage to honor their business hours and care just a tad more about their customers.", "author": "Belinda J."}

It is quite a hilly trek to make it out to this area, and I had tried and failed three times. This place is family owned so hours and closure could be quite random and frustrating. There is even a website counting on the community to check to see if its open (http://www.is-the-golden-gate-bakery-open-today.com/)!\n\nWe got there around 12:45pm and there was already a massive line even though it had just opened. It took about 45 mins to get through, but it was definitely worth it! The egg itself is more like a creme brulee, with a hard shell on top that crumbles easily to yield to a light and fluffy custard. The crust is perfect, neither undercooked nor burnt. It also was pretty amazing that after 20 mins, the egg tarts were still freshly warm after purchase. \n\nFor $2.50 a pop, the tarts are more on the pricey side. But they are a bit larger than the average ones you would get at dim sum restaurants.", "author": "Lily C."}

I have always been told that Napoleon Bakery in Oakland Chinatown was comparable and I took people for their word, but they never had that massive line outside. Finally, one day, we noticed that Golden Gate Bakery was open when we were walking somewhat later in the evening and there was barely a line so my boyfriend suggested lining up. There were fresh dan tat right out of the oven at the time and the line was short, so why not?\nWe ordered two dan tat, which my boyfriend checked with me twice about. He kept suggesting ordering a dozen but I said no. Oh my gosh, worst mistake ever. These dan tat are heavenly and perfectly flaky and sweet. I have never had such good dan tat EVER!  I thought about them all weekend. I think about them whenever I walk by. There is no comparison. Golden Gate Bakery is so much better than Napoleon.

After years of business trips, ubers to Chinatown only to realize it is closed, I finally went to Golden Gate Bakery when it was open. The line was about 20 minutes or less (an anomaly, my friend says) on a Saturday after lunch (suspicion: everyone was watching the Golden Gate playoff game). I ordered a eggtart and yes, it's delicious. The egg consistency is more on the runny side, then jello like, but is not too watery. The actual pastry part itself was also amazing. I usually don't like the flaky eggtarts as much, but this one was just flaky enough and not dry. Must eat when hot and fresh.\n\nI docked one star for the inconsistency of open hours/no way to tell unless you go there.

I broke my veganism streak to try a bit of their desserts and I must shamefully say, it did not dissapoint.\n\n4) At $2.75 a piece for most things, the pricing is a bit steep and since it's my first time here and wanted my family to try some, I spent ~$40 for 8 tarts, 2 moon cakes, 1 bag of almond cookies, and 1 sesame ball. That's pricey for food in China town haha\n\nWe got:\n\nEgg tarts - 4.5/5\n      It's one of those dishes that's easy to make decent, but hard to make stand out, and upon the first few piping hot bites, the flavor of the egg was too much (remember, I haven't had eggs in a long time) and so I deemed it decent, with potential. The crust was so flakey and was the saving grace at the time. After eating it again, cooled an hour later, the sweetness from the sugar pulled through and the custard had set to a better consistency instead of the jiggly steamed egg appearance. The bf and I both agreed this now was worth the rave. It could be that our poor souls have never tried legitimate, traditional egg tarts, so the former profile is what makes it good and what folks seek out. We don't know, don't stone us XD. \n\nCoconut tarts - 5/5\n         We overheard people in line praising the Coconut tarts so we thought we had to give it a try as well. These were amazing! Very popular amongst my Vietnamese relative. (As a culture, we don't eat egg tarts, so while it's good, these seemed to have a better flavor profile depth-wise)\n\nSesame Ball (Banh Cam) - 3/5\n           The intrigue with these, were that they were huge. Filled with red bean, encased in a rice/tapioca outer layer with a deep fried sesame crust, it's a classic Chinese/viet dessert. It's decent, but nothing you can't find at other bakeries. These guys are always vegan. \n\nLotus Moon Cake (Banh Trung Thu) - 4.5/5\n           We also over heard these were good from the crowd. The girl in front of us also reccomended it, so you know... Peer pressure.  The skin on these were dried out perfectly, texture - wise, and the filling was sweetened just enough, while the egg yolk was salted perfectly as well. My only critique is that the batch I got might have stayed in the oven a bit too long as I could taste a slight bitterness emitting through the skin. But overall, the quality and taste is the same if not better than Kieng Giang in my opinion ( Socal's popular bakery for moon cakes)\n\nAlmond Cookies - 4/5\n        Traditional in taste, not overly sweet, and comes in a pack of 6-8 I believe. I'm not particularly fond of these cookies, but they were popular amongst yelpers. \n\nWe unanimously recommend the Egg and Coconut tarts; Moon cakes for the older crowds.

Be prepared to stand in line for 45 minutes for the privilege of being a customer. Do not tell them that you want egg tarts that are less burnt bc you will be ignored or told to leave. Be prepared to hand them cash quickly (they have no patience here) and to be treated brusquely. Also do not be surprised if they disappear for months at a time (handwritten sign on cardboard will read: on vacation) ... if you try to call ahead you will get yelled at and possibly hung up on.\n\nBut also be prepared to eat the most delicious egg tarts, fresh out of the oven, with their molten egg custard centers still tender nestled in their flaky, buttery pastry shells. Eat these hot, standing on the sidewalk. You've officially been initiated into the club of those-who-know locals who enjoy such delicacies in SF Chinatown daily. \n\nThen walk across the street and find the alley with Bruce Lee's face and take a photo of yourself.

I was really looking forward to this. It just tasted eggs, but nothing else really. It was semi-sweet which was nice, but the crust was richer to me.\n\nThe line wasn't too bad when I got there. I only waited 30 minutes. The creme horn looking cannoli was good though. I really liked the filling b/c it had walnuts and raisins, but the dough was just okay to me. Overall, very fast-paced. Know what you want because they take orders fast and people will try to order before you even though they're after you in line. Cash only! $27 for a dozen. Pretty big tarts though so 1 was enough for me. Random hours and EVERYONE comes here. A lot of locals, people even driving 1 hour or 2 away to just come here, and tourists. I think it was worth trying though. LOVE that they bake everything fresh. so it is piping HOT when you order. Appreciate their service and quality.", "author": "Tan Lo S."}

Highly recommend for those who want something light or have a sweet tooth!\n\nI've also had the coconut macaroons which were very chewy and crunchy in texture. A pretty solid pastry, but not as outstanding as the egg tarts and very comparable to other coconut macaroons made at other bakeries.\n\nLastly, I just wanted to emphasize that they're almost always on \"vacation\" (i.e. closed).

We would rather fly directly to Macau to have THE WORLD's BEST EGG TARTS!  Yours is average compared to the ones sold in Macau.  You people need to be more humble and realize your customers \"made you\" as popular as you are today.  But you treat them like they're bothering \"YOU\"?  That was exactly how they made us feel.

This place is CASH ONLY which is typical of most places in Chinatown.\n\nTwo older grandma-type ladies run the shop and can be a bit impatient and mean with you if you don't know what you want or if you don't have your money in your hand.

However, they really do have tons of customers and their egg tarts are delicious so I know they're busy dealing with customers.\n\nSo, let's talk about them egg tarts. The crust of the egg tarts is made with layers and layers of hand-rolled (most likely since this looks like a traditional Chinese pastry) flaky dough. Perfectly crispy. The interior of it contains a perfectly baked egg custard filling: bouncy, smooth, and delicious. It's the consistency and taste similar to that of of creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e- rich and sweet. Also, I find 1 egg tart quite filling.

It truly is and an unassuming one too. It is so easily overlooked when you walk by due to its simple and outdated store front. You can say they keep it real and I honestly think they just don't bother updating or spending money. Whatever the real reason is, they draw a long time among tourists and locals alike. \n\nThey sell a selection of Chinese bakery goods including egg tart, coconut tarts, fried sesame balls, walnut sponge cakes as well as seasonal moon cakes. I have never tried the other items here but I did see people buying them. I haven't been here for over 2 years and I just came by last week to find out that each egg tart is now $2.25. I think it is overpriced for lack of visible reinvestment into the business. If you pimp up the space, come up with new flavors, adjust to inflations or open additional stores, I feel it makes sense to increase the price. However, when other places sell them at the same price over the years and they raise it to over $2, it just seems like greed to me. Then again, I am no business person and this is just my silly opinion. \n\nIf you really crave warm fresh out of the oven egg tarts when you visit SF, you should certainly look up their odd store hours and wait in line.

What I really like about these egg tarts too is that they are not too oily. I don't feel completely greasy after stuffing my face. And, the custard to crust ratio is perfect (not too much crust and they don't skimp on the custard).\n\nI do have to knock off one star because of the number of times that I have been disappointed by Golden Gate Bakery. It has nothing to do with their egg tarts, but solely because every time I come here, they are closed, contrary to what their Yelp page says.

Most people said these are the best ones in the world. So I ordered 6 of these morsels. It cost $2.50 each. So it rose in price. This is probably the most expensive in the country by far.\nThe ratio of egg custard and puff pastry are just right. The crunchy, flaky puff pastry is excellent. The egg custard is perhaps made with whole eggs, milk, water & sugar. It is jiggly soft so it may have gelatin, & it is brushed lightly with a vanilla syrup. To my standards the egg custard wasn't really good. So it was 3/5. Pretty half disappointed on the egg custard, and half phenomenal on the pastry. I am going to try their lotus with 1 yolk mooncake later tonight.\nCustomer service is organized here.\nThe way they packaged is special, they cut the box corners to make sure the puff pastry is crunchy & flaky. So it is an art.\nThe egg tart is way too overpriced like $2.50. In my opinion, the Hong Kong & Guandong makes the best dan tat. Way too overhyped.\nBut most people think this is the best dan tat. I had tasted & eaten a lot delicious egg tarts.

In taste they are balanced by a mellow sweet and soft egg custard and a nice crisp slightly salty tart.

They are $2.25 a tart and a dozen for $27. I highly recommend coming here. I think my only qualm is that it is so popular that only thing it offers is egg tarts because of such a high demand.

Google will give you a certain opening time, Yelp will tell you another but ultimately it's the sign on their door that will dictate if you will leave happily with egg tarts in hand. I found out the hard way about the time as I arrived at 10am on a Friday ready to receive these deliciously egg-y, palm-sized treats but read the hand-written sign on the door that said \"noon\". I wandered around for a bit but returned by 11:30am. I was already 10th in line at this time and patiently waited for noontime. At noon, slowly but surely the line moved and I approached the counter where three older women were bustling around selling \"cash only\" Chinese pastries, but most of them were egg tarts being bought by the dozen. \n\nTotally worth the wait.

If you happen to walk by and they're closed but someone's inside, they might tell you the next time they're open for business.\n\nIn addition to the egg tarts, they also make other baked goods and pastries, but everyone flocks here in droves specifically for the egg tarts. Expect to wait at least an hour in a line that could stretch half a block down the street before you're able to get in to order. You don't have to worry about them running out because it appears like they constantly bake new batches, and if you're REALLY lucky, you'll end up with some tarts that are fresh out of the oven.\n\nThe tarts themselves are definitely worth the wait. They're definitely on the larger side, and at $2.15 each, it's also a bit pricy. There's no discount for buying a dozen, but there's a sign to let you know how much a dozen is. The custard has an eggy texture, is very soft and fluffy. The top of the custard has an amazing and perfectly smooth finish to it. The crust is light and airy, with a satisfying crunch to it. It's very flaky, buttery and almost melts in your mouth. The tarts are piping hot, so exercise some caution before biting into one. The workers will cut ventilation holes in the box to let heat escape as a way to prevent the tarts from getting soggy.\n\nIf you're fortunate enough to be in town when this place is open, change whatever plans you have to get here.

Be prepared to wait, usually 30mins but longest has been 1.5hrs Chinese New Year weekend (ashamed to admit it but I, along with a block of other people, waited and bonded and waited together)\n\n2.

Their long lines always make people passing by question what the wait is for, but once you walk past the entrance and smell the sweet aroma of baked goods, you can't help but also wait in line. I came here on a Saturday at 1:00pm and waited about 30 minutes, but the wait is definitely worth it to get those freshly made egg tarts. This place is cash only but there's an ATM right across the street if you forget. \n\n*FOOD* \nThe egg tarts are their most popular item. The price is gradually increasing being $2.15/piece as of today, but the egg tarts are bigger and more fresh compared to the ones that are $1/piece. The egg tarts are delicious and served warm from just coming out of the oven. I love how flaky and buttery the crust is, but as for the filling, I wasn't a huge fan of how eggy some of mine tasted. It seemed like they were from the same batch, but some of them had the perfect filling consistency while a few were more runny/eggy. Regardless, they were still tasty and not overly sweet. \n\n*LOCATION*\nVery small store just to allow the people ordering inside. There's only street parking since it's SF, but there's a parking garage (Portsmouth Square Plaza Garage) just a few blocks down (~5 min walking!) that's $4/hour. \n\n*SERVICE* \nService has been pretty good the few times I've gone. If you're just ordering egg tarts, they have your order ready in less than a minute unless they're waiting on a new batch, which probably takes an extra 5 minutes since they're constantly being made.", "author": "Christine V."}

First that there is always a long line and second is that there is no way to know when they will be open. I've passed by Golden Gate Bakery many times while walking through Chinatown and each time it's either closed because they are on \"Vacation\" or there is a long wait due to the slow moving line of people waiting outside, so I've given it a skip. This changes a couple of days ago. Around 8 pm there was absolutely no line so I decided to give it a try.\n\nI got 3 of their custard tarts ($1.95 each). Even at 8 pm which is their closing time they were fresh out of the oven and piping hot. These were literally the best egg tarts that I've had period. The crust was flaky and the filling light. I wished that the filling was a little sweeter but that's more of a personal choice rather than the norm. Egg tarts from other bakeries in Chinatown range from $1.10 to $1.40 a pop so these are definitely a lot more expensive. I guess the additional cost is what is paying for their frequent vacations and arbitrary opening times. Golden Gate Bakery is a tourist trap no doubt as it is on the must visit place for people visiting San Francisco. The product is excellent but when you factor in the high price, long wait and not knowing if they will actually be open, I can at best give them an A-OK grade.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

Tack on a 45 minute long wait, and that's the experience you'll get at this bakery.\n\nWe all know egg tarts or dan ta's are the name of the game here at GG Bakery. Sold by OG grannies, who offer zero smiles and lots of delicious warm pastries instead...this place is a staple of Chinatown SF. Although most people walk out with the big pink boxes of a dozen egg tarts, they also offer fresh baked goods from sesame balls to moon cakes. There aren't descriptive cards to indicate what you're eating, so if you're a vegetarian or have allergies to certain baking ingredients, I'd stick with egg tarts because it's just dough, egg, dairy, and no meat.\n\nI highly recommend calling them before you head over to check and see if they're open. Yup, although Google Maps says they're open everyday from a certain time to close, it's usually wrong. Every time I'm in the area and decide to wait in line for some egg tarts, the place is usually closed. CALL. It'll save you disappointment and time. Parking here is rare, unless you get some random street parking on one of the hilly side streets...so take public transport or Lyft.\n\nAfter coming here a few times over the course of my lifetime, I think local bakeries offer more delicious and less expensive egg tarts. I wouldn't wait in line to get their dan ta's which aren't as flaky in crust (it's more crumbly like shortbread texture) and less like flan in the eggy center.

I seriously had a deja vu moment because I've never set foot into their store and yet I clearly remember ordering egg tarts for myself in that store before! \n\nThe egg tarts had JUST come out of the oven, and yet the customers in front of me weren't even buying them! More for me right? We bought half a dozen ($1.95 each), some strawberry pies, and a sticky rice cake. The prices of pastries here are actually not cheap. Each item seems to be more than $1.50, and buying them by the dozen doesn't result in any discounted price either. \n\nSo was that egg tart worth the three disappointed visits? The answer is a solid YES. I ate it right away when it was still warm and fresh, and it was amazing. I wouldn't say the egg tarts are as good as the ones I've had in Hong Kong (where they're even cheaper!), but they would give the HK bakeries a run for their money. These egg tarts are filled deep with custard and bigger than most SGV bakeries' egg tarts. Custard had the right amount of sweetness, and the crust was a warm, delicious, and flaky piece of goodness. The smoothness of the custard definitely contrasts well with the flakiness of the crust, making each bite THAT amazing. I usually like to scoop out the egg tart's custard like a cr\u00e8me brulee before eating the crust separately, but no can do. I had to eat it all at once. Amazing! I ended up consuming three egg tarts that day and ... not even sorry. \n\nThe strawberry pies - we saw people buying it, but they were a major disappointment. I think this is geared towards their American customers/foreigners. If you're a fan of Asian pastries and baked goods, don't try this. Very strong taste of persevered jelly mixed with walnuts and canned strawberries. The crust was not too bad, especially when eaten warm, but not something I would try again. \n\nWe also got a sticky rice cake - not what we were expecting when we ordered the \"sew bang.\" This was very similar to the sweetened Taiwanese rice cakes; not a fan as this was quite tasteless. \n\ntl;dr - YES an absolute must-try if you're in the San Francisco area. Don't be disheartened by the number of times they're on vacation. Try again if you have to! Or visit the is the golden gate bakery open today website. Workers were really fast and efficient. We were in and out within 5-10 minutes with our delicious egg tarts. Now that I've had them, I don't feel like I'm in any rush to go back, especially since they're so hard to catch while open. But I'll definitely make a trip and stop by to see if I can get more egg tarts the next time I'm in SF!", "author": "Tiffany C."}

The egg tarts are under $2 each and priced pretty fairly while the moon tarts are $8 each and not at all my taste. Also there was some confusion about what flavor moon pies they had among the employees so I'm still not really sure what kind we got. \n\nThe line moves slowly but mainly because most people buy the tarts by the dozen so they run out after just 2-3 people get through the line and can't bake them fast enough. It seems like with such a long line and history that they could work on a more efficient way to produce more, but maybe that's part of the draw. \n\nInside was pretty janky. Not gonna lie- the cleanliness of the place seemed pretty questionable. There's a hand-written cardboard sign that asks customers not to take photos or video inside and I have to wonder if that's in part to the mess of boxes and miscellaneous piled up everywhere. For real, they have both a door and a door mat made out of leftover cardboard.

In fact, their schedule is so notoriously erratic that there is a website solely dedicated to monitoring it. Here you go: http://www.is-the-golden-gate-bakery-open-today.com/\n\nOn the off chance that you are able to catch them open, prepare yourself for a test of patience. Do you see the line of people that wraps down the street and stretches all the way back up? Yep, get queueing!\n\n// Egg Tart - 4 stars\nGolden Gate Bakery's signature pastry comes with a generous amount of custard and a perfectly flaky crust. It has more of an egg-dominant flavor rather than a sweet one. Definitely comparable to the versions I've had in Hong Kong, but I wouldn't call it better. Personally, I still prefer Portuguese egg tarts much more.\n\n// Sesame Ball - 2 stars\nI was so excited to purchase the most giant sesame ball I've ever seen. However, opening this sucker up was a huge let down as there was barely any red bean in it. \n\n// White Lotus Seed Paste Moon Cake - 4 stars\nI really enjoyed this traditional moon cake! Wonderful flavors and smooth textures all throughout. If you've never had moon cakes before, this is a great classic option.\n\n// Black Bean Moon Cake - 3 stars\nNot sure I've heard of a black bean moon cake before, but it tasted just like red bean to me. In any case, the texture of this one was a little too chunky for my liking. \n\n// Strawberry Pie - 3 stars\nThe filling was mixed with strawberry flavored bits which added a nice crunch. It was pretty ordinary otherwise.", "author": "Miko B."}

We stood in line thinking that it was gonna take forever but I think we were super lucky because it took about 25 minutes until it was our turn to get egg tart. The line started to build up a lot after we got in the line. \n\nSo the wait wasn't bad and when it was finally our turn, we found out why it was taking a shit ton of time. People ordered boxes and dozens of these and it takes time for them to pack all of the egg tarts. The ladies here were super nice and cute. They were friendly and quick with the service. We ordered 4 egg tarts and we wanted to order something else since we were in line so long already. We then got the white sponge cake (the literal Chinese English translation of this cake is \"white sugar cake\"). \n\nEggtart was just AMAZING!!! Now I know why I was really never into egg tarts at dim sum restaurants. I just never had the good one! The crust was super flaky and crispy and the egg custard was super soft and smooth. I loved how it was still warm because it was fresh out of the oven. I had to have another one after the first one. Now I regretted not getting more for myself! So the one bad thing about this place was the \"white sugar cake\" that I got was bad. It turned sour within 2 hours of purchase. I am not sure about the other bakery items there but I would definitely come back and stand in line just for egg custards", "author": "Tran N."}

There's not much advice that can be given or suggestions to be made. If Chinese baked desserts interest you, you would already know or have heard about it.\n\nGold Gate Bakery has had a solid following in the local Asian-American community since for-fucking-ever. On one end of Chinatown, they are going to have lines out their doors no matter what happens. I live in San Jose, and there is a solid community here of people who specifically love Golden Gate Bakery's egg custard tarts. The goddamn Cult of Golden Gate Bakery Egg Tarts is a real thing here. Whenever we stop by San Francisco, no matter what group I'm with, we ALWAYS STOP HERE. I get LOOKS if I so much as insinuate we do otherwise. At this point, their slitted, pink donut boxes are pretty recognizable. Even if you don't know WHEN they're open, if you're walking down Chinatown, you know IF they're open because there is a smattering of people walking down the street with one or four of those boxes. This is convenient when you need an impressive mooncake for the Mid-Autumn/Chinese Moon Festival. They sell those too, and it always impresses the traditional, Chines families.\n\nThe process entails this: Get in line, wait anywhere from 45 to 65 minutes (an hour and five minutes has happened to us before), order at the counter, they'll box it up for you and slit them so that the heat doesn't make the tarts or pastries soggy, pay in cash, and shoulder your way back out on the sidewalk.\n\nI know this routine as well as anybody else. When my family goes to San Francisco, we're expected to buy 2 to 3 dozen egg tarts to bring back and redistribute among friends and family in San Jose. We have being doing this for as long as I can remember, which means at least over a decade . From these experience, I can only give you one piece of advice...:\n\nSend the dispensable family members/friends. Give them some money, go about your business, and have that one or two friends/family wait in that hour long line. It's brutal and selfish, but only one truly needs to be sacrificed (and in my family, it's me or my brother).\n\n......\n\nThis has got to be one of the shortest reviews I've ever written, and it's about sacrificing family members and friends to your food cravings. The world is a beautiful, beautiful place.", "author": "Christine L."}

Yes... flight sale... thought to myself... it's been too long since I've had a food orgasm.\n\nWhat you need to know is... this is not just any egg tart... no!  You cannot categorize this with all the plebeian tarts of the world.  This tart is in a league of its own.  It is the supreme epitome... if this were the bar... no other tart deserves to be called a tart.  You will not be able to imagine the ecstasy that is this egg tart unless you commit yourself to the 45 minute line that is always in front of that door... you must bite into a piping hot tart right out of the oven to understand why people are willing to withstand that long line for a $1.95 egg tart?\n\nThis could become a dangerous addiction if the recipe got out.  The owners of the bakery mysteriously disappear for months at a time every year.  Are they going on vacation to enjoy the fruits of their yearlong labor?  I don't think so... I think they are traveling to the deepest highest mountain temple of China... to train... to meditate... to practice the ancient art... of tart.  Yes, and probably harvest some rare herbal endorphin that makes us all crazy for this tart.  \n\nSo... to all of you out there who don't live in San Francisco... book your ticket now.  Come for the tart... stay for the bay.", "author": "Hanh P."}

The custard here was very fresh and warm with the perfect sweetness. In proportion to the crust, it had there was so much filling! Some places are skimpy on the filling, but this place is very generous on that. However, it is $2 each custard which is much more expensive than the usual custard ($0.75-$1.25), but still worth the money!!\n\nTIP: there is usually a line and they are open whenever they please.

It was deceiving though, as I waited over an hour for the egg tarts. The egg tarts sell out quickly, so it was mostly due to waiting for the next batch to come out. \n\nI ended up buying a dozen. It was $1.95 for one, which is pricy. Once I got my box, I couldn't wait to try an egg tart and scarfed one down. The crust was thin and flaky while the custard was smooth and creamy. I also bought a mooncake (lotus seed paste), just one as it was about $8. I never really cared for mooncakes, but I might as well since I was there. It was one of the better mooncakes I've had.\n\nCash only. Thankfully there was a Chase across the street.

If they don't pick up once call again. If they don't pick up the second time. They are probably closed and on vacation.

We waited in line for 30 minutes and we were literally the 60th or so people from the front of the line and hundreds more after us. Egg tarts practically all tastes the same (seriously, i have ordered them from Paris Baguette, 85 Bakery, Shengkee, you name it!) but GGB is A-perfection! Fresh out of the over (burnt my tongue - I was so excited to taste it), their egg tarts so smooth and slightly sweet with perfect crust - so flaky and crips! I also had it the next day and still tasted so fresh and delicious - unlike other egg tarts (the next day, it's eeeeehhh, OK). I noticed people ordered by the dozens so they kept bringing out new fresh batches of egg tarts one tray after the other. It's the best one I've ever had. If you have had egg tarts from different places like I have, you will know the difference. \n\nOther great bakery goods that I highly recommend: Coconut Muffins (SO GOOD!!) and their Lotos pancakes (well, that's what I call it.) It so delicious. It has lotus filling inside. Let's just put it this way: If you love Chinese baked goods, GGB is the place for you! \n\nWe were fortunate to be in the area while this place was open because from the chatter amongst the people standing in line, this Bakery has weird hours. They are only open maybe 3-4 a week and on random hours too. It's a hit or miss. Business hours is unreliable!

I also got one of the red bean sesame balls and those were delicious, the outside was crispy and good and not too drenched in oil.

It was always either too sweet or too egg-y. Like why. When I came to SF this was raved about, but me and my sister just kind of shrugged it off. We both love food but didn't like egg tarts. While getting dimsum at another store we happened to be in the area. There was no line (which was a freak of nature) and I think it so was the world's way of luring us in otherwise we wouldn't have bothered. So yes we went in and bought two. We each took a bite and our eyes widened and we both said \"wow\". \n\nBy the time we finished our two egg tarts, we knew we wanted to buy more... alot more. When you watch other people they buy these tarts by the BOXFULL. We thought it was weird till we ate it and wanted to do the exact same thing. In those couple of minutes a line had formed so we did go right back in but had to wait in line, which normally there always is a line or so I've read. We bought a ton more and enjoyed it the rest of our stay in SF. We ate a ton of new and awesome food while we visited but these egg tarts stick out the most in my mind. \n\nSo, moral of this story is to try these egg tarts no matter what. It's a Must! \n\nEXPERIENCE\nAfter the first time we went there was always a line so be prepared to stand in one. But the line does move fast.\n\nI'm Asian but not Chinese so it's always a little intimidating going to a full on Chinatown establishment. But it wasn't too bad here.

She spoke English and Cantonese, and was the nicer and chattier of the 2, as the other lady behaved more like the egg tart version of Seinfeld's Soup Nazi.

A guy on the street told us they have the best egg tarts in all of San Francisco.

Also, we were born and raised in the US so I suppose we are accustomed to sweeter treats. \n\nThat all being said, we found the Golden Gate egg tart to be pretty nasty. We got one to share RIGHT out of the oven (scorched my tongue) and all we tasted was scrambled egg with an extremely small hint of sweetness from the crust. If that is what they are supposed to taste like then you will love them. Judging by all of the positive reviews, it might be.\n\nI also bought a banana rice roll. The texture (from the rice flour) was gum-like and mushy. I found it to be oddly satisfying. Although, the flavor was extremely artificial. I can assure you that no real bananas were used to make this dessert. It tasted like candy.\n\nOverall, the prices seemed fair, the customer service was pretty good, the place seemed like it was in violation of some health codes, the wait was probably about a half hour long, and the baked goods were terrible.

Their egg tarts(priced at $2.25 each) was the best I've ever had and the buttery coconut macarons melted my soul.\nWaiting with so many people also made place for some great conversations and really is apart of the SF culture.

What makes them worth $2.25 each? Here goes (not in any particular order):\n\n1) these actually are about 1.5x larger than others I've had in the Bay Area. \n2) the crust... super flaky, almost like a croissant. This is not your average Safeway store bought crust. I've never experienced crust like this except perhaps my grandmas pie crust from back in the day. This actually is I think possibly even better.\n3) the egg filling... not too sweet. Super fresh. A simple taste that is only possible when you use just a few ingredients and no preservatives. When you bite, you first taste egg, almost like an omelette. But keep tasting and you taste a milky/cream taste. Don't swallow yet. Swirl it one last time over the tongue and you will barely taste a hint, just a slight hint of sugar. In a world full of overly sweetened baked goods I am a huge fan of bakeries that  are capable of exercising some self control when it comes to adding this nearly toxic ingredient (sugar). It's needed for sure to complete the flavor profile of these, but I'm very thankful this bakery has determined the exact quantity required for this recipe.\n\nWe got our 18 tarts warm... really actually hot and slightly jiggly in the center. We ate  one of them immediately nearly burning our mouth. I recommend eating them this way whenever possible, but they were still quite yummy several hours later once they had completely cooled. Do yourself a favor. Stand in the line. Try it for once in your life! Then you be the judge.", "author": "Chrys K."}

How about that!\n\nFor those of you who do not know, Golden Gate Bakery is known for their famous egg tarts. People in the food and Yelp community will rave about how good their egg tarts are. At the same time, they'll also cry over how impossible it is to actually try the stuff at Golden Gate Bakery. For this shop is only open once in a blue moon - there's a website devoted to notifying you when it's open here http://www.is-the-golden-gate-bakery-open-today.com (doesn't work anymore though?)! And, if you do catch this place while it's open, be prepared to wait a LONG TIME. \n\nI decided to drag my girlfriend to Chinatown in hopes of being the lucky few that catch Golden Gate Bakery while it is open. I had a good feeling, since some of my good Yelp friends spotted it open for business weeks ago. And low and behold! On Sunday, April 2nd, Golden Gate Bakery was open, alive, and well. After finally finding parking at a parking structure (I gave up...), we made it to the end of the line. \n\nTo be honest, I thought there would be an insane line that wrapped around the street for these egg tarts, but there was a much smaller line out the door. Don't be deceived though because customers will take FOREVER to order. Since this place is only open once in a lifetime, people will try to buy everything. It took us maybe 30-40 minutes to finally reach the front. And although we were scared they'd run out of egg tarts, we ordered two fresh ones. \n\nAnd how were these egg tarts? Let's just end my review here and say that they were \"Omg, I'd drive two hours for this\" good! For $1.95 each, you get a GIANT piece of egg tart that is smoking hot. Have some napkins/gloves ready because these things are hot, hot, hot. After letting it cool a bit, we chomped down into a delicious, flaky, and soft egg tart. It was definitely the best egg tart I have ever had. Unlike most egg tarts you get at Chinese togo shops or at dim sum restaurants, this one wasn't stale, it wasn't cold, nor was it rough to the taste. This was one smooth and soft. I loved it, and the only regrets I had were that we ate them too fast and that we didn't order more/anything else.\n\nGolden Gate Bakery is a must, even if it might take several tries to get in and wait in line. \n\nEat well and prosper,", "author": "Bryan W."}

In fact, I tried my first one just last year and it was from a small forgettable bakery. I couldn't say if I liked it or not at the time so I simply forgot that egg tarts even existed. Fast forward a few months and we found ourselves in San Francisco. It was only by chance that we had just eaten lunch at a restaurant right across from Golden Gate Bakery and sheer luck that they were open at this time. The line intrigued us enough to walk over and wait for these little custard filled treats. Now, the line does move somewhat slow. The bakery is tiny and everyone is ordering these egg tarts and it looked like by the dozen. We waited about 45 minutes for our dozen. \n\nWe got them hot and tried one right away. This was my husband's first egg tart and he didn't really like the flavor of the tarts (no fault to the bakery, he just didn't like tasting eggs in a dessert form). I also admit that when I tried it hot, I didn't like it all that much. However, I tried it again after it had cooled down and I found the tart to be absolutely delightful. It was so soft, and the tart was just so flaky and it was absolutely delicious. The right amount of sweetness also and that custard was just so smooth and divine. I loved them. My only gripe with Golden Gate Bakery is the price. They're pricey at almost $2 each! Still, if you really enjoy egg tarts I think it might be worth it to try Golden Gate Bakery. They certainly were worth the wait for me. 4/5", "author": "Michelle L."}

For me, the chance they will open is 20%; I have been here 5 times and they opened only once. In addition, on days when they are open, you really don't know exactly when they open. Their official opening time is at 8am, but it could be any time. I got 10:30am two times, one for Chinese New Year Parade and one on 4/7/17. That is the store. \n\nThe food. I only had the egg custards, and they are pretty good. They are the best I ever had, especially when it's out of the oven (really early or late afternoon).

Enough said. \n\nI might have given this place five stars, but this business is not dependable in terms of store hours. I always get disappointed when I go up the hill in Chinatown to find that the store is not open or they changed their hours.

My family has been getting egg tarts from here for as long as I can remember. What makes the egg tarts here so amazing is the perfect balance of soft egg-iness and sweetness in the center custard and the perfect flaky crust of the outside. The crust on the outside is like a croissant but still sturdy enough to hold the tart together. The egg tarts are a good size, about the size of my palm or maybe the diameter of a normal sized wine bottle. While $2.25 may seem expensive for an egg tart, it is definitely worth it. \n\nI came in recently while showing some of my SoCal friends around San Francisco on a Monday night. Even though it was about 6pm on a Monday night there was still a 15 minute wait - but don't be deterred the egg tarts are worth the wait. They make them continuously throughout the day so they're as fresh as can be. If you are making a big order, they may make you leave and come back to pick it up a little later (we came back in 30 minutes) but you can just leave and walk around Grant St while you wait. The two ladies running the shop are very nice and speak Cantonese and English. When ordering a whole box, they will cut out the corners of the top box to let out the steam from the fresh tarts to prevent the flaky crust from getting soggy. I usually order a box at a time and eat them as snacks over a day or two. As long as you keep them in air tight containers once cooled, they'll still be good to eat the next day.

We had been walking along Grant Avenue, and by luck, the lights were on inside with just a few people waiting in line (all waiting for egg tarts, which were baking in the oven).\n\nSince my last review, egg tarts have gone up in price, from $1.60 to $1.95 per egg tart. Years ago, these egg tarts were less than a dollar each! Inflation? Tourist prices? Go figure. \n\nIs it worth the high price tag and wait? Sort of. The line can be pretty annoying but honestly, I haven't had egg tarts as good as the ones here elsewhere in San Francisco. The egg tart's crust is flakey and not too thick -- while the custard has a soft, milky, buttery, melt-in-your mouth texture that is absolutely amazing! I would probably recommend visiting GGB at off hours (like close to closing) than during peak hours (such as around lunch time). Visiting GGB during off hours to purchase your egg tarts will make your experience much more pleasant.\n\nEven though GGB is a tourist hot spot, it's also popular among locals like myself. If you haven't been here before, it's definitely worth a try. Come sooner than later, before they hike up the prices again.", "author": "Matthew L."}

For today and for this place, I will call them DARN TART !\n\nWe drove by and saw a long line. My gal pal, Yuri, waited in her car, acting like she was going to pull into a space on the street around the corner. I ran to the shop to stand in line and made sure that I was in the correct line on the right side of the door. The people in front of me had called in their order, so I immediately called to place my order. The lady who answered the phone seemed preoccupied. I looked in the window and saw them boxing up some of the goods. Listening to the people in line, I learned that the shop is actually on vacation and they came in today to do a large special order. We were lucky that they were answering the phone and taking names. The lady at the door told us that they don't usually do this and not to tell others....so, shhhh... mum's the word!  (Wink, wink)  ;)\n\nSomehow, my phone call to her ended,  so I called again. I told her that my name was \"Luk\" and used the best Chinese accent that I had. I told her I just spoke with her and she had asked me how many I wanted. She asked me for what time. When I said, \"now\", she said that I would have to wait. I said. \"Yeah, yeah! (Using my assertive Chinese accent)\". She agreed to a 1:30pm pick up. (20 minutes). (I win)\n\nShe came to the door and filled a couple of orders then pointed to me.  I knew what she wanted.  I told her that I just spoke to her. She said, \"I told you wait\"!  I replied, \"I am!\"  Then she nodded (understanding that she is speaking to another Chinese woman) and directed me to the other line on the left side of the door. (I win)\n\nI'm not the rudest Chinese woman on this earth, but I know that game.  When you try to cut in line and speak Chinese... hey!  I'm not deaf!  So I had to speak (in my loud Chinese accent) that I was here first.  That woman behind me was smart. ..she backed off!  (I win)  Plus, the lady at the door saw my $21 cash in my hand so she took it. (That's a good sign that I'm getting closer to my goal!)\n\nFinally, she came back with a pink box!  It was tied with white plastic string and 2 corners of the box were cut open to vent the steam. ..nice!  She placed the box in my hands and I carried my trophy to the car!  We brought our gift to my cousin's house where we relayed this tale of victory and glory!  (We win!)\n\nConclusion: is it worth all of the hassle? Definitely! The crust is on the thinner, crisper side. The custard is moist and \"just right\" sweet. These egg tarts are on the larger side and better quality, so they cost a bit more. However, it's better to consume them while they are fresh and warm...  So good!  \n\nIf you need help,  just bring me with you...hahaha!  It's fun!  I promise not to hurt anyone. ..

This is basically a commentary of the journey to the egg tart, so skip everything and scroll to the bottom for the actual food review haha. But I feel like the journey is the important part to the destination, so read on if you please XD\n\nWe came here on a Saturday night around 6:15pm and spent over an hour waiting in line for these famed egg tarts. Made it just in time before they closed!I mean, we had to see what all the fuss was about XD It was kind of funny (but not really) because the egg tarts came out and semi-constant intervals (i.e. 10-15 minutes for a batch of a few dozen), and so this was the rate and frequency at which the line moved. And then when the person at the front of the line bought like all of them (a few dozen), everybody in the line would stare down the person coming out and be like, \"What is that girl/guy gonna do with 2 boxes of egg tarts??\" Of course there is no system where 1 person can only buy max 1 dozen - it's a group of Chinese grandmas running the show, I'm thinking probably cash only? At least I assume so (and the grandpa sitting in the chair behind the counter snoring haha).\n\nThere felt like some kind of camaraderie while waiting in line haha. Sadly, the people in front of us waited just under an hour and then ended up leaving (why??) and we got our egg tarts soon after. Also another sadly is that one guy with his wife (and baby) who was near the back of the line asked another lady 1-2 people in front of us to buy egg tarts for him. We should have given him a bigger death stare down or like really smh because dude, we're all waiting here. If everybody tries to get somebody in front of them to pay for them to get egg tarts, then there's no point of a line, and nobody lining up will ever get egg tarts! Gotta think Kantian ethics and categorical imperatives here. Actually if I cared enough (or had big enough balls) I might have said something just to prove a point/teach a lesson, but oh wells we were so close to getting our egg tarts that I was like EGG TARTSSSSS more than anything haha.\n\nAnyways, on to happier times. If you look at the face of whoever is at the front, there's always a huge grin on their faces, with excitement at the golden treasures that lie within the pink boxes, and that's precisely how we felt when we placed our order :D\n\nEnough with the commentary. On to the food review. I could honestly just leave it as the egg tarts were darn good.\n\n- Egg tarts: so delicious, you really need to try them for yourself!! I've never had an egg tart with such perfect balance: gooey egg filling (plus it was hot/warm, having just come out of the oven) and a flaky but not super oily crust.

We yelped the highest rated dessert places and this came up and we head over - ONLY to realize the line is halfway down the block! We debated waiting but we had 15 mins to kill so we waited....\n\nThe guy behind us was a nice young man from San Bruno, who said a bunch of friends recommended their egg tarts and mooncakes. Both of which, i basically grew up on! \n\nAnother 10 mins roll by and we get anxious. We need to catch a shuttle back to the hotel... so we decide to call an uber and try our luck. Finally we make it inside the store but there is at least 10 people in front of us. It starts to get crazy because they can't make the egg tarts fast enough and they were waiting for a fresh batch. People outside get angry. It gets chaotic. Our uber arrives and my group tries to stall. The uber driver says he'd wait if we got him one. \n\nMore time passes and the ladies up front are yelling to the guys baking it. It's hectic. I finally say, ok just give me some moon cakes and let me get the heck out of here! I mention we came all the way from the  east coast and the woman's like \"and you don't want to try our tarts?!\" And I'm like \"no i do! But my ubers literally about to leave me!\" And she screams, \"they're ready!!!\" And i'm like what?? And she asks how many I need and hands me half a dozen in front of angry customers. I feel reallllllly bad, but also couldn't say no. I paid whatever price she throws at me and dash into the uber. \n\nNow about these egg tarts...\nI've grown up eating millions of these after summer school in NY. My uncles even own a chain of famous bakeries in NY. But wow! Golden gate bakery's tarts changed my life. I was a hero in my group for bringing these back... they melt in your mouth and taste like heaven.\n\nWorth the wait and madness!", "author": "Lisa C."}

However, I think their poor service and lack of customer appreciation is a big stinker.  During my visit to SF earlier this year, I came here only to be disappointed with the big sign on the door that they're on vacation.  I've read on numerous Yelp reviews that they randomly close and are on \"vacation\".   Throughout my stay, I did call them and no one picked up so I didn't bother going again.  On my most recent trip to SF, I called them as soon as we landed and they picked up.  I asked what time they're open till and the lady promptly said 8 PM.  She didn't say anything else.  They were our first stop from the airport and guess what?!  They were closed!!!  I saw staff working in the shop but the sign on the door said they wouldn't open until 2 PM.  I was so pissed off.  Was it too much to ask for her to have told me they're open from 2-8 PM that day while we were on the phone?  Uggggh.  \n\nI honestly didn't think we were going to get any egg tarts but the hubs reminded me that we were in the city and we should try one more time.  Off we went and of course there was an insane line.  Damn, why do they have to be so good???  Flaky buttery crust that kinda falls apart when you eat them.  Or maybe it's because I'm a fattie and couldn't wait for them to cool down a bit.  The custard is light yellow, jiggly, not overly sweet and melts in your mouth!  I scarfed down three in an hour.  \n\nThe staff isn't the most helpful/friendly but I'm sure it helped that I spoke chinese.  I believe they allow you to order a certain amount of egg tarts due to the high demand.  When it was my turn to order, the lady asked me how many people was in my party.  Since it was me and the hubby, she allowed me to order a dozen.  \n\nTips:\n-Call in advance and ask them what time they're open and what time they're closed!\n-Pretty sure it's only a dozen per person.

But this place changed my mind (about Chinese cuisine; sorry Mexican, I'm still waiting to be impressed by your bakeries).\n\nMy wife visited once on a recommendation and raved about their egg tarts. So the next time we went to Chinatown she insisted we visit Golden Gate. Sadly, there was a line and a sign on the door saying that they'd open in two hours. But as we shuffled our feet indecisively, we saw one of the owners open the door a crack, and quickly hand a bag to the first person in line. Money was exchanged just as furtively. Intrigued, we got in line and discovered that the owner was serving one person at a time.\n\nWhy? I have no idea. We peeked through a gap in the window and could see a man asleep at a desk in the back. Maybe it was nap time? I don't know, but I do know that the owner tries very hard to please her customers, and she is exceedingly nice. Some people complain that they're on vacation a lot, or that they're closed often.

I don't want to outdate myself, but I would say 25+ years ago whenever we made a family trip up to the Bay Area. This particular bakery is located in the old Chinatown of San Francisco.\n\nI have never known until the last time I came here that there was such a long line of people outside waiting to buy their pastries.  We must have waiting a hour before we finally got in to order the pastries.\n\nI must admit that they make delicious \"Don Tats\" or egg custards. It's basically battered egg poured and  baked in a small round crust which is simply delicious! The concept seems simple, but I'm quite sure there's a lot of work behind it.  \n\nThey also make delicious coconut puffs... which is similar to the American rice crispies. It's the same simple concept, and the preparation is also similar to rice crispies. Again, delicious!\n\nThey sell other baked goods such as pound cakes, bread buns, and baos.  Whatever is purchased depends on the quantity will either be bagged or boxed in the traditional pink Dim Sum box and tied. It brings back so many childhood memories just by looking at the pink box reminiscing how I use to open up the boxes and just smell the aroma when my parents use to buy dim sum.\n\nThis bakery has been around for a long time. As you peak in the store, everything looks the same... the floors, walls, display cases, etc. Only the strings used to tie the boxes has changed into the more flimsy kind instead of using red string. \n\nI like this place, but never realized it has become so popular. The Chinese ladies working inside are nice, especially when you speak the same Chinese dialect. Yes, you'll get shoved a few times by an older lady who does not believe in lines. But nobody in line waiting complains knowing that they're elders.\n\nAnyhow, great memories here and I wish Golden Gate Bakery the best.", "author": "ED L."}

The custard was extremely tasty, not too sweet, but just right. However, the texture of it was a bit thicker than I'd like and on the egg-y side. Overall, the egg tart was great. Warm and tasty, but I wouldn't stand in the long line for just one. I also had the vanilla sponge cake, which to be completely honest, I loved a lot more than the egg tart, but that is just personal preference. The texture was exactly what a sponge cake should be like... soft and spongy, melts on your tongue delicious-ness! The vanilla filling is buttery, sweet and naturally tasty. If you're going to stand in line, buy a few dozen egg tarts or try out some of the other items on the menu, everything is pretty tasty. \n\nCustomer Service: Fast, friendly and efficient. The woman that helped me clearly knew I was new to the establishment and she made some recommendations right off the bat.  I will mention the weird vacation sign that I posted a photo of, which apparently isn't uncommon. Their business model is quite confusing, but it is after all their business. I'd recommend that you give them a ring before investing your precious time in coming here and then having to go home empty handed.\n\nAmbiance: Very busy, long lines, crowded storefront. Nowhere to eat your pastries, maybe that's what the corner opening in the box is for... on-the-go consumption!\n\nPrice: Reasonable, but on a steady incline from what I've read.\n\n\nOverall: Good egg tarts and other pastries, prices are okay, but the wait isn't too pretty.

I don't know what luck dawned on me that wondrous day I road-tripped to SF during finals week from San Diego. It was my first time going to GG Bakery, and to my surprise, it was OPEN and there was NO LINE. Sorcery, right? I could barely believe my eyes as I squealed and entered the bakery. I kid you not, my hands were shaking from excitement. \n\nThese egg tarts are a bit pricey and it was ~20$ for a dozen, but IT IS SO WORTH IT. And I would do it again.\n\nWhat makes these egg tarts different from all the other SF egg tarts? Every. thing. First of all, they're warm. So warm, it's like they literally just came out of the oven. Secondly, they're so flaky and crispy, but just so enough that it doesn't taste like you're eating a slice of butter. Thirdly, the filling to crust proportion is perfection. When I buy an egg tart, I want the eggy part! I don't want to be eating a bunch of crust! Lastly, and probably most importantly, the egg tart itself. It's creamy, yet firm. Almost flan-like, but solid enough to not be pudding. \n\nThese egg tarts are literally melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness. 10/10 would go back again.

The store layout looks very cramped and inefficient. They really need to clean the place out to make room for a better bakery and maximize profits. I'm sure they lose some business from the long wait.\n\nBut the dan tas are the best you'll get in the U.S. I love how they're always hot when you first get them. And the egg custard to crust ratio is 9:1. Not very standard for most egg tarts and very difficult to make since the crust will most likely fall apart. Although it's thin, the crust is probably the best part! It's always perfectly flakey and baked to a nice dark brown color.\n\nI would definitely go back on a weekday when it's not as crowded.", "author": "Jia-Wen H."}

I personally have not tried any of their other pastries, so these 5 stars belong to the dan tats alone.\n\nThere is almost always a queue here. And this place is not always open or hours are inconsistent. Luckily, all but one time, this place has been open when I've stumbled through.\n\nThe storefront is pretty small and can only fit a handful of people inside. You need to know what you want to order before you get in because this is a hustle and bustle type of place. Don't hold up the line by trying to figure out what you want and asking hella questions. Also, if its the end of the night and theyre taking orders for how many dan tats you want, don't argue with the ladies saying you want more than what they can offer to make sure everyone has enough. I'm sure they don't care how far you drove for it (no offense).\n\nFor all the reviews complaining about customer service (which are the only negatives you'll see in the non 5-star reviews other than the inconsistent hours), you need to understand the kind of establishment this is. This is not their priority and even if you try to knock 'em on yelp, they have a loyal enough fan base that this will not affect them or compel them to change their ways. It really is good enough to forgive the service.\n\nThe egg tarts are always piping hot out of the oven when you go in. They are best served that way IMO.

After years of hearing so much about this holy grail of a tart, I set out on a serious mission in search of it in the midst of Chinatown. \n\nI call this: Operation Egg Tart\n\nNow, from many people, I've heard so many stories of how Golden Gate Bakery is always closed or the hideous lines that snake around the block. So, in order for me to combat some of these perils, I decided to do a bit of research to ensure my mission. \n\nGoogle, duh. \n\nI Googled their location and hours which stated that they were open every day from 8am to 8pm. I thought to myself, \"Why was everyone having such a hard time?\" These are like prime hours, even for those who have to rush after work to get these coveted bites. \n\nSo I drove to Chinatown to attempt my first bite of these famous tarts. Anyone who has been to Chinatown definitely knows that parking anywhere in or near this area can be a beast. BUT, I did manage to find a discreet metered spot just around the corner. \n\nThe stage was set... A cold, gloomy day, a tad windy with a slight drizzle of rain throughout. The streets were crowded with people with open umbrellas. I slipped through the streets with strong intention. Even in the dampened air, I caught a whiff of sweet smelling breads baking. As I looked up, I suddenly caught sight of the storefront. \n\nAs I hurried to the doors, I noticed that the bakery itself had gated windows, door shut, lights dim. There was even a sign out front that said they were out for vacation. I began to hang my head thinking that I too have failed this mission. \n\nI kept my eye on the store with a longing heart as I stood under a canopy of another store. Then ever so carefully, a man dressed in a suit approached the door and knocked. An older Chinese woman appeared at the door and stuck her head out. The man stated something in Cantonese and handed her money. She then closed the door and soon reappeared with a few pink boxes. \n\nOh M Gee\n\nI sprang to the door before she was able to close it. She then looked at me and simply stated, \"How many would you like?\"\n\nSo excited, I could hardly get the words out. \"I would like a dozen egg tarts, please.\" She then replied, \"OK, $21 cash only.\"\n\nCash? Noooooo! I only had my credit card in hand. I have come too far to fail now. I quickly looked around in a panic and noticed Chase Bank ATMs directly across the street. Oh how the stars have aligned for me that day.\n\nEureka!\n\nIn ninja like action, I was at the ATM and back across the street in an instant. Thankfully I had an extra dollar in my pocket and happily forked over the $21 bucks.\n\nI couldn't wait another minute. I quickly opened the box, snapped a quick photo (you guys know what's up), and bit right into the prized tart. \n\nSweet mother of dandelions! It was everything I had hoped for and more. Soft, flaky crust, warm gooey, eggy center, with a kiss of sweetness. \n\nOperation Egg Tart was a complete success.", "author": "Ann S."}

I've learned to take a zen approach to this--never seek out GGB, let it seek you. Rather than making the mistake of going to Chinatown in search of their delicious egg tarts and expecting it to be open, this time I stumbled into Chinatown with no purpose but to explore and was greeted by a big crowd of people right after I passed Jackson St. \n\nI waited in the line for maybe about half an hour? It wasn't too bad. It was pretty fun getting to chat with the people around me to hear about best practices in the egg tart acquisition industry. Anyways, time flew by and I was soon at the counter. So one tricky thing that I noticed about ordering at this place is that you need a nice repertoire  of your Asian pastries before you get in. Unlike other bakeries where the goods are out for display, these goods are hidden away in baking pans in the back or covered away in sheets, so you better study up and be ready to request. \n\nThis process made me realize that I do not know any Chinese pastries in English. I got 9 egg tarts, 2 buo luo bao (bread with sweet flaky topping), 4 sa qi ma (sweet rice cake thing), and one of those vanilla flavored roll cakes. Total was only 25.50! I love how cheap Chinatown is. \n\nThe rundown:\n\negg tarts--sweet buttery flakes of deliciousness. They come out hot and the sides melt in your mouth and are so delicious!! They're also pretty big and filling. pro tip you can leave them in the fridge for a few days. just turn your oven on to 250 and bake them a bit to warm them up\n\nbuo luo bao--yum, pretty good. loved how soft the bread was, though not sure if it's super amazing\n\nsa qi ma--pretty good, though I'm no connoisseur of this--this was for mama Xu\n\nvanilla cake--yummy as well!\n\nBasically. The wait is worth it if you like good Asian pastries, though if you aren't picky you probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference I do think this place caters much better to people who speak Chinese obv or know their Chinese pastries since ordering is a lot easier that way. They do have English menus taped on the counters but my Chinese upbringing didn't prepare me to try to buy pastries in English. \n\ntldr; super cheap delicious yummy pastries! they're never open though.. so pro tip is to definitely always call ahead", "author": "Jasmine X."}

Why in the world would I pay $1.75 for a mediocre egg tart?? Yes it may be due to the fact that they're always piping hot out of the oven.

Walnut pound cake use to taste better; it's kind of crumbly now, but still soft/fluffy. I like how it's not too sweet.

Apparently that is what Golden Gate Bakery got really famous for.\n\nI wasn't exactly sure how big or how far their popularity has gotten until all of my friends started to talk about it when I mention \"San Francisco.\" Being born in San Francisco and being raised a good portion of it within Chinatown, I could definitely tell you that \"Golden Gate Bakery\" does not ring as loud when I was younger. \n\nThe only other memory of having egg tarts from Golden Gate Bakery was about four years back. That is assuming that I haven't had it as a kid or maybe I did but didn't know it was from there. They didn't have a long line and I was just passing by. I've heard about it but the scale of their popularity never hit me at the time. I decided to get some egg tarts since the lady told me that it was fresh from the oven. At the time, I paid about $1.25 for each egg tart. Even then, according to my grandmother, their prices have raised drastically. \n\nOn a recent trip back to San Francisco to pay my grandmother a visit, I decided to try Golden Gate Bakery again. I wasn't sure if they were going to be opened because they have this habit of just going on vacation whenever they desire. Due to a helpful tip on Facebook, we found out that they were opened. We went straight there. There was a line (go figure). The line definitely attracted people. Tourists that didn't even know about the bakery decided to stand in line because there were so many people there. He said, \"I'm not sure what I'm standing in line for but I just have to since it looks so popular here.\" Of course I had to tell him that he had to get the egg tart since that's what they are known for. Haha. \n\nIt was probably a 20 minute wait for me. A dozen of egg tarts will run you $21.00 while if you bought them separately, they were $1.75 each. Wow. Holy price raise. It probably doesn't seem like a high raise but for egg tarts? For a bakery? Yes, it is quite the increase. \n\nI ate one, boyfriend ate one, gave my friend two of them, and gave the rest to my grandmother and her friends. Her friends also made a comment on how much the egg tarts were. I can't say I'm mind blown. I can say that they were done well and the custard is not overly sweet, which is very much appreciated. A plus is that they are fresh but how can they not be? With the amount of business and turn over rate, they better be fresh! However, I can't say that I'm in love and I can't say that I would do that again. On top of it, they were rushing out orders like mad so I'm not sure how careful they are with the actual product. The egg tart that I had was a little overdone so it was a little more cooked on the edges, which led to a small burnt flavor to it. I do believe that I liked the ones I got four years ago versus the ones I got this year. Plus, I like mini egg tarts more than full sized ones :P \n\nOh, CASH ONLY. Don't get in line without it. But no worries. There is a Chase across the street, like a five second walk, and there is a Citibank down the street or something.", "author": "Doriee D."}

The wait is actually agonizing as you watch people walk out with the famous pink pastry boxes. You'll frequently question what could possibly be taking so long. It should only be an in and out kind of ordeal right? Well I can tell you that the reason the line exists is because they are literally bringing up fresh egg tarts that have just finished baking, tray by tray, every 15 minutes or so. These are the real attraction and the sole cause for the line. There are a bunch of other offerings like mochis and rice cakes but you can't leave without picking up an egg tart. Walking out with warm egg tarts is honestly one of the best feelings in the world...obviously second to actually putting one in your mouth.

You have effectively ruined other egg tart establishments for me - so thanks.  \n\nIs your pastry dry and tasteless? No.  is your custard too eggy or over-cooked? No.  Why do you do it? Why must your egg tarts be so goddamned perfect? I went to my local dim sum joint last weekend, and the waiter asks me and I want something sweet to finish the meal, \"Maybe the egg tarts?\", he suggests.  Nope, couldn't do it.  I already knew that everything would fail in comparison.\n\nAnd you want to know the worst thing about Golden Gate Bakery's egg tarts? They're so freaking good, that one day you'll be like, \"Hmm, maybe I should try other stuff here?\"\n\nSalted Egg Yolk Moon Cake? Delicious! \n\nRed bean-filled Gluten Balls?

I wanna take away stars because parking is an absolute nightmare here (virtually non-existent - don't bother driving.

Of the six times which I have visited, I succeeded in conquering some delicious egg tarts twice. Consistency? Non existent.\n\nAfter waiting in line for 40mins amongst a cluster of hungry pastry lovers, we finally managed to walk away with half a dozen egg tarts. They have done the contrasting texture well. Sinking my teeth into some soft, cloudy-like wibbly wobbliness, delicate, creamy and warm (a little too warm that my tongue protested in pain) filling, which is juxtaposed against the buttery, flakey, slightly crispy crust was pure indulgence. My only complaint about the dan tat is that the bottom should be lightly toasted, in this case it was not (probably due to the ridiculous high demands.) \n\nThe reason why this I am only offering three stars is the lack (or rather, barely existent) of customer service. Three ladies hustle and bustle their way behind the counter, yelling \"NEEEEXT.\" It was my turn. As I was about to order, one of the ladies snarled at the other (in Cantonese), \"are these people all deaf?! What is wrong with them?!\" I stood in shock and turned. Behind me stood a Mandarin speaking couple happily chatting away and behind them, a cheery caucasian family. They had absolute no idea that the comment was directed at them. \"You!\" The same lady shot a word at me and I suppose that was my indication to order. My initial excitement plunged.

Luckily for us, and thanks to the bride and groom, after our 10-course Chinese feast at R&G Lounge, a plate of Golden Gate Bakery's famous Egg Tarts were brought to each table!\n\nNo having to see if they were open for business or not, no standing in long lines, none of that!, just take one and pass it down. SWEET! I finally got to see  and taste what all the rave was about. So how was it? Well, to me, these were the best looking tarts by far with a nice flaky crust, BUT they had a more eggy taste than the other two we tried earlier(Anna, Eastern) which was fine by me. As I looked over at the lazy susan, I noticed that there were extra tarts, and before I could even consider getting another one, a couple of people on our table had already asked the waiter for take out boxes to box up the extras. NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!\n\nOh well, at least I got to try them, I thought...When the reception was over and everyone else was heading to a nearby lounge to continue the festivities, no one wanted to take any leftovers home, so we became the designated leftover takers of about 10-15 pounds of Chicken, Peking Duck, Lobster, and Black Cod! There was also a pink box all by itself , full, and untouched of EGG TARTS which we gladly took home as well. Boy, was my frown turned upside down in seconds!

Instead I'm going to focus on my experience procuring these golden egg tarts, since it was a little bit unusual...\n\nBefore you visit, visit the FB page (https://www.facebook.com/pages/Is-the-Golden-Gate-Bakery-Open-Today/394882013908745) and make sure there aren't any posts about it being closed. It doesn't hurt to call them and check either.\n\nBefore I went on a Wed afternoon around 1:30, I did my homework and checked the FB page. According to that, it seemed to be open, so I headed over. \n\nHowever, when I got there, there was a \"Sorry we are closed for vacation\" sign and the door was closed. I was pretty crushed, understandably.\n\nBUT as my friends and I were standing around mulling in our disappointment for a minute or so, an old lady opened the door and proceeded to hand someone else an order of egg tarts. She then took our order and told us it'd be about a 10 minute wait.\n\nWe ended up waiting about 30 minutes, but we walked away with 16 shiny egg tarts for $1.60 each!!\n\nMoral of the story is - don't give up just because there is a closed sign out in front. They might still be taking secret orders if you wait for a little bit ^_^", "author": "Dianna H."}

I will never forget the love at first bite indulging myself with my first egg tart at Golden Gate Bakery. It was fun watching other pedestrians glare at my pastry with envy while I made approving facial expressions of how delicious it was. It was a glorious super cheat day moment, and taking all those high carbs had me at \"YOLO!\" I can't get enough of those savory eggy beautifully crusted fresh dan tats (also known as the egg tart.) Just thinking about them makes me want to do naughty sinful, gluttonous, and impulsive types of eating... IN THE DARK! (That way I won't feel so guilty for being super gluttonous...)\n\nThe line can be pretty long. It seems like the average customer waits about 5-15 minutes to order something fresh. However, I can promise you that wait will be worth all that time! A thing to keep in mind is that there is no picture taking or video recording allowed inside the bakery. (Probably they don't want someone stealing something? I don't know...) However, if you want to Yelp or Instagram that sexy little pastry, you will have to do it outside of the shop. \n\nOverall, this is a pretty neat shop, but you better get there before the clock strikes at 6 PM!", "author": "Aubrey D."}

Apparently they are notorious for this and for taking random days/weeks off. Understandable since they are a small family business but it's inconvenient for customers who make the commute to their storefront only to find it closed. I can't recommend calling in advance since they often don't answer\n\n- High prices. The egg tarts were $2.25 APIECE. That's 2-3x the price from other restaurants and bakeries!!

Per several of my Yelp friends, we made sure to stop at Golden Bakery for their famous Egg Tarts.  I have to be honest.  I was really skeptical because I don't usually care for Asian sweets but I think it's because I never know what to order. \n\nWe arrived around 2:30 and there was a line ... a pretty long line which we were prepared for. The wait wasn't to bad, maybe 20 minutes and while we waited we got to really take in the area and do some people watching. China Town is super colorful and filled with great restaurants, unique shops and LOTS OF PEOPLE!.\nAs we were standing there in line we couldn't help but notice we were the only Caucasians in line. Hmmm another good sign that this place is not only authentic but pretty tasty.  We watched the constant flow of people leaving carrying perfectly packaged pink boxes.  I'm talking 3 or 4 at a time!  And from what I could see, inside were those infamous little egg tarts.  Mouth watering ....\n\nWhen it was our turn to order, I almost felt back only asking for two tarts when everyone else got boxes of them.  But since I haven't had great experiences in the past, I figured 2 was a good number to start with on this trip.  The nice lady at the counter packaged my tarts up in a little paper bag and out the door we went.  Um .... I'm not sure why I was so surprised but when I felt the bottom of the bag and realized these little handfuls of goodness were WARM I couldn't wait to eat them.  So I reached in and gently pulled out the little cup of warm goodness.\n\nThe crust was light and flaky.  The filling was bright yellow and OH SO GOOD!  Creamy, warm, sweet deliciousness. I'd compare it to a Cream Brule and warm vanilla pudding.  Now I understand the hype, the line and the desire to make this a permanent stop when we're in China town for sure.\n \nThe women at the counter are friendly and fast.  Bring cash because I didn't see anyone using credit cards nor a machine in sight. Don't get intimidated by the line outside or the lack of items on the trays in the window.  The line moves fast and there are plenty of delicious bites once you step inside this tiny little shop.  It's a bucket list stop for sure.", "author": "Christie B."}

Theme park rides, uhh fast pass please. DMV? Online renewal stat!!! You get the picture! So, why the heck would I wait in line for this place? Truth be told, I wanted the best mooncakes to take back home in order to serve at a family dinner. Thankfully, yelp steered me in the right direction and found me the right spot. Thanks yelpers!     \n\nWhile in line, I was waiting outside wondering why the heck the line was moving was so slow. I erroneously equated old ladies to slow service that led to long lines. Well, when I finally entered the shop, I realized that I was so OFF! It's because all the people in front of me kept on ordering 5-10 boxes of mooncakes or 40 egg tarts. I didn't realize how serious this mooncake business was until the woman in front of me pulled out stacks of hundreds, WOW! Those grandmas were seriously wheeling and dealing!  I don't even know how they were able to work together in that cramped storefront. You had 2 ladies constantly restocking items, 1 lady taking care of to-go orders, and 2 taking care of the line. \n\nAnyway, when it was finally my turn the lady who helped me was very patient and kind. She answered any questions that I had and quickly packed up my items. I left with 4 mooncakes and 3 egg tarts(just to see what the hype was all about). I chose the mix nuts one with ham, 2 lotus one, and one with coconut, almonds, and melon(my fav choice!). All the flavors were delicious, even the ham one! At first I was like wtf am I buying and why did I get this crazy flavor? But it all made sense when I eventually tried a small piece. It really was a perfect balance of salt, sweet, and savory!  \n\nI didn't get to eat my egg tarts until I got to the airport, but when I did I understood. It was like that silent bond you share with your bff; you just know. The funny thing is, I don't even like egg tarts that much! It turns out, I just haven't had the right ones yet. The crust was moist yet flaky, while the egg custard had a light flan texture with the right amount of sweetness.

As they have become more popular, it seems that they've had a tendency to take more and more unannounced breaks. Sometimes they'll put signs up stating how long they'll be closed for, other times they'll just say they're closed indefinitely (meaning I have no idea when I'll get to eat my next egg tart!!). Guess they can afford to take as much impromptu vacation as they want. The second bad thing is that there's often a wait because of how popular they've become.

Despite being only 8 or so people back in line (a very long line developed behind me), it still took 20-30 minutes to get my coveted tart.

The tarts are $1.80 each, which is a steal for how filling they are.  The flaky, crispy crust is delicious.  Where the custard started to set up and cool around the edges, I thought it was good.  Eggy, but slightly sweet.

I don't think there is a review scathing enough to capture the absolute ridiculousness of their business model and service. \n\nThis bakery is famed for their egg tarts just as much as their fickle business hours. We just so happened by their store front, where a group of customers were waiting outside the door. Shocked that they might be open for business, we checked it out. After heading over to investigate, I found out that the people who were waiting had pre-ordered egg tarts.\n\nThe lady working inside kept the door shut, only opening it to take additional orders or to collect money. There was no order to their line or even a distinction between those adding on orders versus those who had pre-ordered. Adding to the confusion was a sign on their door stating they were closed for vacation. \n\nWhen asked about the wait time, she told us that she still had a list of pre-orders to go through, but refused to estimate how long until they would be able to serve the add-ons.\n\nFrom the glimpses I caught of the store, it appeared very unkempt inside with papers and boxes strewn about. The disorganization did not boost my faith in their ability to keep track of their orders.\n\nPerhaps their egg tarts are the best in the city.  Perhaps they are cheapest priced egg tarts. Perhaps this was enough to attract customers decades ago. But the blatant disregard to their customers' time and unprofessional service marks them as a dinosaur in modern times. Unevolved.\n\nAs someone who frequents Asian restaurants where service is expected to lack, I was still appalled. Clearly, Golden Gate Bakery relies on its outdated reputation.", "author": "A T."}

But it's no easy task finding a good Dan Tot in the streets of SF. Luckily, Golden Gate Bakery has masterfully recreated the sweet experiences that Hong Kong natives have of the Dan Tot. Though all these experiences are guaranteed delicious, they can vary between different types of Dan Tot eaters.\n\n1. The Big Biter\nPossibly the most prevalent of all Dan Tot eaters, the Big Biter looks to finish their treat in around 3 bites. A satisfying way to enjoy one's Dan Tot, as each bite brilliantly contrasts the crispy crust with the soft yellow custard. \n\n2. The Nibbler\nPrecision. Attention to Detail. The Nibbler employ a solid set of tasting skills to enjoy every last intricacy of the Dan Tot. Yes, they're the ones that will tell you about the multi-layer crust that flakes off like a buttery croissant after every nibble.\n\n3. The Boss\nThe Boss eats the Dan Tot with a spoon. They simply scoop up the sweet custard and leave the crust untouched. Quite unorthodox, but it certainly maximizes the sweetness in each bite. Plus, it looks super boss.\n\nAt a little over a dollar for each Dan Tot, you can definitely try out all three ways of eating the Dan Tot for under five dollars.

In this particular case I had 3 hours between a hospital in Antioch and the SF VA, so for lunch I decided on a quick dim sum run. This was the second of three stops. (An afterthought: DO NOT do this. Couldn't eat the tarts right away so I had to store them in my purse. I could faintly smell the tarts during the lab tour)\n\nYou'll notice this place because there will be a line out the front - not surprising in part due to the 4 1/2 star average, 1900+ reviews here and other accolades. Supposedly they close at random times; there's an actual website AND FB fan page JUST to track this (http://www.is-the-golden-gate-bakery-open-today.com/)\n\nI went close to 1pm and surprisingly there wasn't much of a line at all. Within 5 minutes I was at the counter placing my order for 2 tarts ($1.40 each). One tart fits the palm of my hand. Yolk was a pale yellow and the outside had a crust of puff pastry.\n\nI have several considerations of the most ideal definition of \"foodgasm\" - this is one of them. A GOOD puff pastry crust is quite buttery that the crust falls apart when you eat it, this is definitely something you do NOT want to munch on if you plan on keeping your clothes clean. The custard has creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e consistency and not that of an undercooked scrambled egg. If I add a little cinnamon and broil the pastry, this would then turn into my ideal pasteis de nata. \n\nCons that it's a messy eat and it loses a bit of deliciousness when it's not fresh off the oven - those I blame myself for doing this within a super tight timeframe. Next time I'll have to try their mooncakes.\n\nUPDATE 1/4/2014: I tried their coconut tart. The closest to what I can describe is \"coconut-flavored cornbread\". I'm not super fond of coconut, but there was enough to detect it yet I appreciated how warm and fluffy the pastry is.

At one point I was beginning to think that if i didn't make it my personal goal to try the egg tarts then I would be messing out. \n\nLucky for me during my last day in SF my friends decided to drive us to Chinatown to try these delicious golden treats. We found parking close by and walked about a block to the bakery. I heard they are notorious for closing randomly but on this particular day they were open and the line was pretty short as well (i heard people wait up to 1 hr around the block at times). Once we made it in the tiny store I noticed that people actually order dozens of the egg tarts at one time. Since I didn't have too much room in my carry on bag we only ordered a dozen to share with our friends. We also got the chance to taste the curry meat pies and those were pretty amazing as well! \n\nTip* Call ahead or check the \"Is the Golden Gate Bakery open today?\" facebook page to make sure they are indeed open prior to visiting. Cash only and its about $16/dozen for the egg tarts.", "author": "Shanon Y."}

I think I even let out a small \"WOW!\" after eating it.  It was definitely very rich and also very eggy, so if you don't like either of those things, then I'd save the effort of trying these.

Don't be ashamed to steal a bite once you walk out of the shop because you'll see other people standing on the sidewalk doing it too!

Theirs are a little on the stickier side. My boyfriend tried wrapping a piece around a napkin and the napkin got stuck all over it!

She suggested we stop by Golden Gate Bakery to see if they were open, I confusingly followed her. Apparently, they have a PERMANENT sign on their door saying closed for vacation so they can open their shop at different hours of the day. It was around 3PM on a Monday when we stopped by and saw a Chinese woman glancing out the door. My friend knocked on the door to check if they were open and she cracked the door open momentarily to inform my friend they were opening at 4PM. \n\nWe walked around and returned around 3:45PM to find a line forming outside the establishment. It was around 4:05PM when the doors were finally open, the line consisted of a mixture of regulars and tourists. It felt like we were at the blackmarket for egg tarts. One of the women at the front of the line was antsy from the waiting and kept pestering the workers. She really needed her fix. We had to stay outside the establishment and tell them our orders and pass cash through the door. It was CRAZY. I have never seen people so eager for egg tarts.\n\nI got half a dozen ($10.50) HOT EGG TARTS for my family. My friend got two ($1.75 each) to share and ate them outside the store. The custard was perfection. The balance of eggy-goodness with the splash of sweetness was amazing. The crust was flaky and everything was still hot!\n\nIt was definitely worth the experience!! I would recommend to go if you are in the area, although they are on the pricey side! I'm used to egg tarts being 90 cents in the Bay but let's be real. It was bomb.

But, they still taste herra good.\n\nThe hype is legit.\n\nOn a Monday afternoon, I finally had the opportunity to wait in line for the famous GGB dan tats (resident of the SF Big Eat 2013 list: http://www.7x7.com/big-eat-2013#/38). Fortunately, the wait to the counter was only 15 minutes, as I was already in a 45-minute wait for the Obama-graced Great Eastern dimsum restaurant. At $1.35 each ($16.20 for a dozen, http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SYsV4RFMkPwjqgbeq0VcIg/l.jpg), these are some pricey pastries, but they are worth every pretty penny.\n\nDan tats, or egg custard tarts, are denser than most other custard desserts (flan, pot de cremes, puddings). Alongside the custard filling, the crust is another judgment factor, which is typically a shortcrust pastry made of a combination of butter and lard to achieve the pinnacle multi-layer flakiness. Seriously, when a dan tat tastes that good, it's probably made with some good ol' lard because that's what is holding all those flaky layers together.\n\nTheir crust is perfect. A perfect crust is not only flaky but also thin so that it complements, not overpowers, the custard filling. This is the thinnest crust I've ever had on a dan tat: crispy and airy without a hint of sogginess. Seriously, how the ultra-thin bottom layer resists moisture absorption is beyond my comprehension. And the multiple vertical layers of pastry in the crust bring me to tears (http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/20qxofAo0tiOCy2GGYoAgQ/l.jpg). It's a work of art, it really is.\n\nHaving baked my own n00b version of dan tats, I can say that the crust takes the most effort. But the custard cannot be underestimated because if you don't bake the tart to the right consistency, you can dry out the filling or have it too wet. They bake it with just the right amount of firmness on top and light mushiness inside, creating a silky-smooth, vanilla-sweet experience. They lean more on the flavor of vanilla rather than on the flavor of egg yolk, which lends more toward texture.\n\nI would also agree with Lawrence E. that dan tats taste better after a bit of cooling rather than fresh out of the oven. The waiting allows the custard to solidify in texture and flavor so that you can focus more on the taste, not on temperature. But warm dan tats are better than cold ones! That being said...\n\nI've read that dan tats are good for next-day consumption, but try to avoid sticking them in the fridge (crust gets soggy) or the microwave (crust gets hard). Rule of thumb for warm dan tats seems to be sticking them for a few seconds in an oven or toaster oven.\n\nA bit expensive at $1.35 a piece, but damn, this stuff is good, especially if you're craving lard! ;)\n\nExperimental results UPDATE: The crust definitely hardens when the dan tats are stored in the fridge, but a minute or so in the toaster oven will soften things up (flakiness is lost, inevitably). The custard filling stayed consistently delicious even after 3 days in the fridge, but the crust on the bottom got a bit soggy from the custard. Condensation doesn't seem to be a problem, thank goodness. These are some good egg tarts!", "author": "Adele F."}

The line was short when I arrived but quickly lengthened as I put my order in.  I ordered 2 egg tarts and 2 BBQ pork rolls.  I didn't see any egg tarts in the display case but the lady behind the counter assured me there were some in the back.  All for $6.16!  The place didn't look like it had a credit card machine so I paid with cash.  \n\nAs I made my way down the block, I inhaled a pork roll and an egg tart.  It was so very good.  The BBQ pork roll was perfectly cooked with just a little sauce inside a pastry crust.  It was flaky, golden, and buttery.  The egg tart wasn't too sweet and the crust was flaky too.

Tarantino often touts the influence of this movie genre on his filmmaking skills).  The movie house was my weekly Mandarin class (between age 9 to 12), listening to shrieks, grunts, and groans from swordfighting films.\nAbout ten years ago, this bakery started getting a reputation for their now legendary egg custard tarts (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q).  A rumor spread about four years ago that the tart maestro passed away, spurring rumors that \"it's not as good anymore.\"  Well, it certainly hasn't deterred anyone about lining up here.\nWith the moon cake festival fast approaching, they finally reopened about ten days ago, much to the delight of the tart lovers and mooncake givers like myself.  I ordered several boxes for friends and business contacts comprising of a mix of four different varieties:  pineapple with egg, red bean, lotus paste with egg, and mixed nuts (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=NhE3W_qkSccBcjaoDdmF-w).  \nMooncakes are a plenty now as the week counts down to 9/8 Harvest Moon night.  The Chinatown stores are setting up tables OUTSIDE their stores to clear their inventory, Costco has them, but my friends seem to enjoy this one the best.  So get there early if you need the tart fix or have a mooncake shopping list to fill.  The only reason this isn't a five star review is no one can predict when they are open or closed.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-10-30", "description": "Golden Gate Bakery is an old style Chinese bakery that has some items that are harder to find in the newer, trendier bakeries.  People line up here for one thing and it is the dan tart.  What is a dan tart?  It is an egg custard pastry.  Dan tarts are supposed to have an eggy custardy center and a flaky pastry, though some places have modified the flaky crust to make more of a cookie crust.  I much prefer the flaky crust over the cookie crust.  Also, I find bakeries tend to either make a good custard and bad crust or a good crust and bad custard.  It's rare to find a bakery that can do both. Over the years, dan tarts have also suffered from poor quality and the custard has deteriorated from having a real eggy taste to some that have no custard taste or creaminess at all. Some are so brightly yellow that they actually have a neon glow and can light your way through darkness.\n\nNot so here, the dan tart custard is soft, custardy, warm, super creamy and utterly delicious. The crust is stark contrast to the sweetened center.  The crust tends to be salty and I must have gone later in the day, but my crust was not flaky.  There is though, a nice contrast between sweet custard and salty crust.  If you cannot get both components of a dan tart perfect, at least one should be superior and Golden Gate Bakery excels in the custard, so don't miss out.  Go where all the locals are lining up because they know where to get a good dan tart. One dan tart will set you back $1.50.\n\nOn another day, I tested out their banana rolls and not as good as others I have tasted.  It seems like I was eating just a mass of glutinous sweet rice flour with a splash of banana flavoring. These banana rolls are $.80 a piece.  Better off adding $.70 and going straight for the dan tart, where your money will be better spent.\n\nThey also have these really hot pink pastry boxes, so if you have a quantity of dan tarts, you too could be walking out in hard not to spot box.

The ladies who work this shop are also sweet, upbeat, and always on top of their game given the constantly long lines and endless barrage of questions from clueless non-Chinese customers and even more clueless tourists.\n\nIn my book, however, a Chinese bakery should be strong across the board to merit a stellar overall rating.

I tried all three, and they were just average (forgettable in the case of the custard bun), which was a bit underwhelming given how good the aforementioned egg custard tart was.\n\nNevertheless, the egg custard tart is totally worth the $1.25, and all the other items, despite being merely average, are much cheaper.

And the only place I wanted to find was this Golden Gate Bakery - just to see why and how good the egg custards are!\n\nLuckily for us, the bakery was open and there were about 4-5 egg custards left.  Since it was later in the evening, these were not the fresh out of the oven batch.  However, we paid and stepped out - I proceeded to dive straight in and see what it's all about.  The custard itself was not special (and perhaps it's because it wasn't fresh) but the egg part - wow!  It's been a while since I've had some good quality egg custard.  It took me a while to appreciate it.  After that, I slowed down and slowly savoured it.\n\nThe bakery did not look glamorous or stand out in anyway.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-04-08", "description": "Many many visits\n\nGolden Gate Bakery is probably the best Chinese bakery in town. It's an establishment dated back to the 1940s. Here you will find traditional Chinese pastries like \"wife cake\", the signature \"dat taat\"---egg custard tart, pineapple bun, Swiss roll, puffy brioche, and macaroon (NOT macaron, I'm so frustrated many people think macaroon and macaron are the same things).\n\n*Wife Cake: also known as sweetheart cake, the Golden Gate wife cake is very flaky with a thin skin. The crushed winter melon and almond paste filling is not too sweet. It's the only place in town you can find the \"orthodox\" candied mash of winter melon mixing with white sesame seed. I love it!\n\n*Egg Custard Tart: is the store's signature item. Usually you'll have to wait as their supply cannot meet the demand. Unlike many other bakeries, Golden Gate uses only eggs and not the egg powder. Custard has a velvety, silky texture with a hint of vanilla. The crust is a pure decadence---a buttery and flaky crust holding together the throbbing egg custard. Worth every penny of $1.40 (for this price you can get 3 at nearby bakeries).\n\n*Pineapple Bun: the point of eating pineapple bun is the top, which is made of a dough similar to that used to make sugar cookies, which consists of sugar, eggs, flour, and lard. This top appears to be like pineapple. It's crunchy, flaky and good.\n\n*Curry Puff: it's like an empanada filled with shredded chicken marinated with five-spice powder and curry. It's another popular item among the locals.\n\n*Pound Cake by the Loaf: is like eating egg and butter. The pound cake here doesn't have lemon or vanilla extract, just pure butter and eggs, mixing with enough flour to give some sort of a stiff texture. Usually pound cake tends to get moist over time but here the cake stays dry.\n\nThe ladies who work here would get very chatty with locals and regulars. They can be a bit Nazi so don't touch the cake container or dish. Be ready when your turn is called. The line can be ridiculously long on weekends. \n\nGolden Gate Bakery does take unannounced breaks at least twice a year for about a month each. Usually they will close about a month before the Moon Festival for moon cake preparation.", "author": "Matt Y."}

It doesn't help that the service is like that of a classic asian place but what do you expect in Chinatown right?\n\nMy first encounter with their egg tarts were when my aunt bought home a dozen of them. She refused to eat them unless she just got them at the bakery. They tasted pretty good even when its cold. So I had to make a trip down to Chinatown to check them out myself.

Now a bunch of people make the same decision and the bakers are now trying to keep up with the demand. So the line gets longer. And folks in line are waiting longer and when it's their turn, they buy more than they can possibly eat in a day. So the line gets even longer!  How did I come to this theory?  Listening to people say they only want a few and walking out with a box or two.  Ugh, we do this to ourselves!  The tarts are good but in moderation.  Trust me.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-01-22", "description": "So many reviews written about this place, so I'll try to make this review as distinct as possible. \n\nAre you willing to wait for a long time to get possibly the tastiest \u86cb\u64bb (dan taat in Cantonese Chinese), or Chinese style egg tarts in San Francisco and possibly the USA? When I waited on a Monday afternoon at this place, it took me 50+ minutes just to get inside this Chinese bakery. It might have been unprecedented for me, but as the queue got longer and longer, I then realized that I did not want to give up my spot. Plus, it was my last day in San Francisco, so I did not want to miss out. I decided to order eight of them for my family. \n\nThis place is a simple, \"low-tech\" place, with a lot of clutter and I think there's a small \"hidden production facility\" behind the counter that makes the \u86cb\u64bb. The description of the \u86cb\u64bb might sound a little exaggerated, but I am going to be as truthful as I can.  \n\nThe crust was not brittle, was not too hard but just right. It had the right amount of flakiness, and a nice tiny crisp, making it an almost flawless crust that I would look for in an egg tart. The custard itself was not too sweet but not too bland with a nice rich softness. It was one of the most delicious egg tarts I have eaten in years, but eating it fresh right out of the oven was even better, with the warmness still there. \n\nComing from a somewhat decent city like Boston, this bakery succeeds in their \u86cb\u64bb where all other Chinese bakeries in Boston fall short. That's how good it is. I think they understand English, but it's easier to communicate with them if you know some Cantonese Chinese and make sure you have plenty of cash. A \u86cb\u64bb is kind of pricey at $1.60 a piece, but you're paying for quality. \n\nOverall, I thought I had not only the best \u86cb\u64bb in San Francisco, but possibly the best \u86cb\u64bb in the USA, and could be a legitimate contender to compete against other \u86cb\u64bb from Toronto or Vancouver. I really hated the wait, but it was rewarding to finally get that box of \u86cb\u64bb in my hands, as if I got a box filled with gold. Would I wait here again? Probably not, unless the queue is shorter, I play a really addicting game on my phone, or I have an interesting companion to have a nice conversation with for more than 45 minutes. It's much more worthwhile to order large quantities rather than wait for just for one \u86cb\u64bb.", "author": "Ambrose C."}

However, the bakery has been closed since November! Argh! After months of waiting they finally reopened on Jan 18 and I couldn't resist stopping by the next day when I was the area. Possibly a big mistake because though I was so happy to have the egg custard tarts again it was a 30 min wait. Not sure if it was because they were closed for so long or because it's crazy on weekends (lots of families walking out with boxes and boxes of pastry). \n\nYes, it's $1.40 per tart but given that most pastry shops sell a chocolate chip cookie for $2 and other pastries for $3+ you should really stop complaining. Even if you can get them cheaper, really are you going to argue over 50\u00a2 difference?\n\nEspecially when these are the World's Best Egg Custard Tarts. Super Eggy soft custard filling. Perfectly baked crispy, flakey, golden crust. It's really the crust that differentiates this place.\n\nI'll note that during weekend lunch the curry empanadas seemed very popular as well. I also recommend the melon cakes while you're here.\n\nNote: I just discovered this site through another yelp review and thought I'd repost it.

But hey, I'm in no mood to get scolded by one of those ladies behind the counter and risk being embarrassed to death in front of all those people! Nope, not me!!!  \n\nBeing that it was just a week or so away from moon festival, the moon cakes were hot items! Old ladies with literally boxes and boxes of them walking out of the shop through the crowd of anxious people! We reach the counter and get our order of tarts. While outside, I see in the showcase, piles of coconut macaroons. I order some of them (four to be exact) and they, IMHO, win me over, not the tarts!! I know my friends will hate on me for saying that, but hey, it's my money! Haha! For those of you who haven't tried them before, get some next time! I really enjoyed them and if you are staying in a hotel like me, the macaroons will definitely last longer than the tarts! I only wish I had gotten more of them... So pick up a dozen or so to take back to your room with you or even to take home. My journey to GG Bakery to have the egg tarts actually got me liking the macaroons a lot more.

Traffic was awful and the line to Golden Gate Bakery was ridiculously long. So, this visit to SF, we got smart about it, we decided to come here the last day we were in SF (on a Saturday) and during an odd hour (around 2pm). We either got lucky or we planned it well, because the 1) the line into Golden Gate was small and 2) traffic around the area wasn't horrendous. My friends dropped me off and just kind of waited for me. I went in and ordered 6 egg tarts and 2 coconut tarts ($12 total). It's such a small shop, so just have 1-2 people go in to order a bunch for the group. Don't do what the group in front of me did and hog up space with 6 people while 1 person ordered. \n\nTo quote one of my two non-Asian friends, \"I've had egg tarts at dimsum, and those aren't nearly as good as this. There is sufficient filling and the crust is real crispy and not so thick. I really like it\". I fully agree with everything he said. The egg tarts are good. If you like coconut, you'll like the coconut tart. This bakery has really mastered the art of a nice think flaky crust and lots of filling. The filling also isn't too sweet, and there's just so much. Although I have to say, for egg tarts and coconut tarts, I wouldn't wait more than 30 minutes for this, but if you go at an off time when the line is short, it is definitely worth the extra buck and change.

I am from la so I wanted a good sampling of items to take home with me. I thought from the yelp reviews this place was a one trick pony. (Dan tan's mainly) but no! This place has a lot of baked goods that are traditionally found in Hong Kong. They don't have those silly bread with cream inside. This is the really deal. They have the white rice cakes and coconut tarts. They have 6 different flavors of moon cakes white lotus, black bean, red bean, pineapple, ham and nuts. Very exciting!", "author": "Monica P."}

Sounds delicious already right? Well, there's also custard inside; it's a bit like the cream rolls at Asian supermarkets. And it tastes like the egg tart and coconut tart combined! Definitely try this, you will not regret it. (And it's cheaper than an egg tart!)\n- Wife pastry (lo po bang): flat, circular pastry with winter melon filling and thin flaky skin. Mildly sweet.\n- Chicken pie: half-circle pastry with the same yummy flaky crust and pieces of chicken, bell pepper and corn inside. I thought it tasted a bit like beef, but anyway, it was savory and delicious!\n\nI recommend lightly toasting the pastries (if you aren't eating them fresh out of the oven).

Or have a rotation with some friends. Or try and ask/bribe someone to buy the goods for you ^_^ FYI, custard tarts are $1.40 each ($16.80/dozen) and the moon cakes are around $7-8 based on the flavor and filling type.\n\nIt was a total mistake to come here during the Moon Festival. We ended up waiting 2 hours just to get inside and get our custard tarts and moon cakes. And in reality, they weren't that much different than normal custard tarts and moon cakes I can buy within 5 minutes at a local SOGO, Marina Foods, or Ranch 99.\n\nThe issue (or good part when there is no line) is that they make everything fresh. And with batches of 24 custard tarts and most people buying boxes of 6 or 12, you can see how the line can get long and stagnant. Each batch takes around ~5-10 minutes. \n\nPersonally, I prefer custard tarts chilled, so tasting the freshly made hot ones wasn't my thing. It was good, but just not my style, so keep that in mind. \n\nAlso, the place itself is really small. It can fit only a few customers inside at a time, and there are no seats or anything. A very buy-and-go type of place.

Tourists walk by muttering to themselves, \"This must be a good bakery.\" Is it worth the 15-30 minute wait? Six dan tats and a gigantic sesame ball later, I can wipe the bread crumbs off my fat kid face and say with certainty, \"Nom yes nom nom.\" I'm also unashamed (and quite proud) to say that I even brought extra dan tats through TSA and back to LA with me.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-09-15", "description": "I love egg tarts.\nSo, when I was in SF for the day I was Yelping on my phone for good places to eat. After seeing the 4.5 stars by 1800+ Yelpers, I decided I would try it out. BUT - made the mistake of not actually reading any of the reviews (very not like me)...\nAfter dinner, we found the bakery - there was a line. But, I looked at my BF and shrugged, \"this line should go quickly.. don't worry... we'll be home right after I get a dozen!\".... Right. (Please see my awesome drawing/photo of what the line REALLY looked like... lol)\n\nI'm not from Frisco, so this was my first time at this bakery. The line I was able to see from 5'6, on tip toes, looked like a cake walk! 45 minutes in, we had only moved up the line by about 4 people... the only reason, was because the 4 people before us, got sick of waiting and left (harhar). To make a long story short - 1.5 hours later, and 10 slots up later, we were able to see the line formation. The only words out of my mouth was \"OH - MY - F*CK!!\". I don't know if the bakery asked people to form the line this way, or it just happened, but the line snaked around like the shape of a question mark. THREE HOURS AND FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER - we finally made it to the entrance of the bakery. Cold, tired, hungry, irritated, and stressed we made our order. A dozen egg tarts, 4 moon cakes. \n\nI don't know if the line is this ridiculous usually... But I'm thinking maybe it was like this because they make thousands of moon cakes, flavors from lotus seed, to coconut & nuts, to pineapple - with yolk, without yolk. I happened to be there the week of Chinese moon festival... Sooo, maybe? \n\nTHE EGG TARTS - were really amazingly delicious. Worth 3 hours of standing in line for? In the cold? Not really. $16.80 for a dozen or $1.40 a piece. Good size. Creamy and eggy in the middle. Had the perfect amount of jiggle in the center. Egg was not too sweet - just perfect. Amazing flaky crust. \nMy irritation of it was the way they boxed up my tarts. Small box - 2 layers. The tarts were just right out of the oven, with only a few minutes of cooling time, before boxed. Now, while they cut 2 holes on the corners of the box to allow steam to escape... that just isn't enough to work. The steam rising from the bottom tarts, sogged up the top layer tarts. And, as pictured, the tarts ALL looked like that. Squished. Bottom and sides of crusts were slightly soggy and top of crusts were still golden brown, flaky, goodness. They really should allow them to cool before boxing them! I understand that they are so popular that they are making egg tarts every 5-10 minutes, ALL day... But, as a business, they should consider expanding, hiring bakers to bake. The reason it took so long, was because they didn't have enough tarts to supply EVERY person in line... So, they would make people wait for tarts to finish... which is why it takes them about 20 minutes to serve 2 customers. \n\nBUT I must give credit where it is due. The bakery closes @ 8pm, and the staff stayed until 10pm to make sure that everyone who stood in line, was able to leave with what they came for. There was still about 20 people @ 9pm (an hour AFTER they were suppose to close). But instead of limiting the last few of us to only 6 tarts max, they decided to stay for as long as needed and continued to bake up tarts until the last of us! Now THAT is awesome customer service. And plus, the staff were all very very sweet and smiled through the chaos. \n\nSo, last thoughts: egg tarts tasted as good as everyone says. They could use some help in the boxing department. So if you would like to try the tarts, I would walk by and check out the line: if there are more than 10 people outside the door, it might take 15-20 minutes. If the line begins to wrap around the side walk - come back another day OR bring a book, and a fold up chair to sit on.. It sure was a crazy experience but here I am 24 hours after the fact, and I have no tarts left.", "author": "Wendy T."}

I usually get four of the lotus seed paste with double yolks. I also like their Pineapple and BBQ Pork Buns for the texture. If you have the time to wait, I would definitely recommend giving them a try.

Finally I bought six egg tarts to celebrate Moon Festival with my friends and to me, it's a tad overrated hype. \n\nLet's start from the taste first. It was good even though I bought it in the morning and ate it at night. You just need to put it into oven then it will taste exactly the same. The crust was flaky and thin and with nice gooey egg custard in the middle. And I have to say, this egg tart is probably with the most flaky and the most gooey custard I've ever had in this area.  \n\nHowever, I would expect more based on reviews and rating from Yelp. Custard was good, but suppose to have more flavor rather than just egg yolk. In other words, the custard was a little bit too eggy and did not match well with their buttery crust. \n\nNext, the earlier you go, the less time you will spend waiting in the line. At least you need to wait for 30 mins generally in the afternoon. Try to visit there as earlier as you can so that you won't waste too much time prob for just one or two egg tarts. \n\nTherefore, they won't tell you when are they on vacation until you actually visit the place. Just cross your finger and pray when you decide to visit and hope they do open at that time. \n\nLastly, I think this egg tarts is a tad overrated hype, and don't worth to wait for 30mins or longer.", "author": "Jing Y."}

The bakery is small and probably only 5 to 6 people can stand inside, while the lines of people are waiting outside for the fresh egg custard tart (dahn tot).\n\nWe were in SF Chinatown to do a little browsing and shopping for lop yuk for my mom and, of course, a stop at this bakery for their specialty, the egg custard tart.  My sister was also looking for another type of pastry; she calls them \"flying saucer\" (they're white and glutinous and they're shaped like a little saucer).  They didn't have any.  However, she did buy my mom her favorite cookies...the coconut cookies (sort of look like them coconut macaroons).    \n\nI am fortunate that I have an older sister to treat my younger sister and me to these egg custards.  I have to concede that they are the best.  The crust is probably made with a whole lotta butter for the melt-in-the-mouth taste.  The egg custard is also delish...so velvety smooth and sweet.  It doesn't have a lot of eggy taste, but still it's all good.  More like, excellent and they are the \"bomb\".\n\nMany moons ago (and they have moon cakes, too), these egg custards were 50 cents each, but now they're $1.35 each.  I wouldn't doubt when and if these people go on vacation and they come back, they will raise the price to $1.50 each.  It's a business and they know what they're doing.  \n\nFinally, there is a saying...\"what's worth waiting is worth getting\".

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-03-01", "description": "I guess Golden Gate Bakery doesn't really need my help in recommending them, but I have to say that their egg tarts are really good. You MUST eat them fresh to enjoy their flaky, eggy goodness. Otherwise, they get exponentially worse with every minute you wait to eat them. \n\nThat said, a fresh GGB egg tart has a delicate, flaky crust. Each layer is really thin and provides a very enjoyable light crisp as your teeth sink into it. The custard is smooth with a semi-gelatinous jiggly texture, and its flavor is pleasantly eggy and sweet but not overtly buttery or rich.  I like that it's not too rich, buttery, or heavy as the crust's relative lightness compliments the sweet egg custard perfectly! These delectable treats are the only reasons you need to take a trip to Chinatown. Yes, reasons, because you won't just eat one.\n\nI also want to add that I only find these lighter, sweeter egg tarts around here. Whenever I've been to Hong Kong or Macau, they tend to be richer and heavier but still very delicious. If you want to try an egg tart that resembles that kind of style, order the Portuguese Tarts (Po Tat) from Koi Palace. They have a thicker, richer crust while the egg custard is more buttery and heavier. They're much more decadent if that's your thing. I can't get enough of either!", "author": "Nei N."}

I've had many egg tarts and make my own, but the ones at Golden Gate Bakery are phenomenal. \n\nThe egg tarts are not shown in the display case because they're inside busy packing it straight from the ovens into boxes. Do not let the other items on the display case lead you astray as it did for me.  Get only the egg tarts and order more than you think you'll want because you'll want another one.\n\nThese yellow delights are delivered to you warm in the box. The custard is milky, smooth, and (just right!) sweet. The crust, however, is a bit flimsy.  Other reviewers say that the crust is flaky, but as an avid pie baker, I would disagree. Though not flaky, this egg tart crust has layers, has a crunch, and is very delicious even the day after when it isn't warm.\n\nFor the best results the day after, I recommend keeping it in the fridge and eating it cold.  Putting it in the microwave (no matter how short), makes the crust soggy. Again, do not get the other pastries. I had the pineapple cake, char siu bao, and cream buns, and they were all not very good. Stick to the egg tarts.", "author": "Ze Lin X."}

The last time I was in SF, this store was closed, so I never got to try their infamous egg tarts. This time I went with a friend to Chinatown just to try their egg tarts. At 3pm on a Saturday afternoon, the line was just 30 min long, so the wait time wasn't that bad.  We got 2 egg custard tarts, 1 coconut tart and 1 gooey dough for just $5.30. Really reasonable price!\n\nThe egg tart was actually quite good. It was not as sweet as the egg custard tarts from other places. This one tasted felt a little more savory than dessert like than egg tarts that I had elsewhere and seemed to be more filling (e.g. more custard portion). The shell was flaky, which made it more delicious in my mind. Their coconut tart and the gooey dough (I don't know what the name was..but it's a circular-shaped white dough) were good but nothing much to rave about. Overall, the egg tart was good and better than those I had elsewhere, but being someone who doesn't and never really cares much for egg tart, I probably wouldn't want to get in such a long wait line here again unless my friend wants to try some of these tarts.\n\nNote: no pictures allowed inside the store.

Known the world around for their amazing egg custard tarts, my visiting friend and I had to drop in for some of the tasty treats.  Parking is a nightmare in the area and after a solid 45 minutes of searching I managed to finally nab one.\n\nThe line outside the bakery was modest since it was only the early afternoon and the smells of fresh pastries wafted into the streets.  I decided to share the love with my entire family and ordered a full dozen of the egg custard tarts to take home, along with some of the sweet rice cakes.  There was nowhere to enjoy their fresh, piping hot goodness in the rain so we ducked into Ten Ren Tea and found a dry quiet spot in back.  Ok, I usually try not to buy the hype but these tarts were unbelievable and just as good as the legend tells.  The custard was so creamy and had perfect texture and flavor that paired with the flaky puff pastry so well.  Unquestionably, there's nowhere in San Francisco that serves up better stuff and at $1.15 each, they're a total bargain.  The rice cakes were super good as well and were mildly sweet and make a perfect treat for kids.\n\nThe drive though a rainy Chinatown was totally worth it to cap off an otherwise not so good food day.  Even though we paid the premium for parking and in gas, I was glad to finally sample some of the good stuff.

It was so delicious: buttery and flakey crust, sweet (but not overly so) and soft center, and it was straight out of the oven so it was at its nicest and fluffiest. I tried to savor the moment, but it was so good that I also just wanted to keep on eating. The heat of the filling slowed me down a bit.\n\nThe egg tarts were $1.65 a piece, and you can get a dozen for less than $20.

We witnessed so many people leaving the lines and also some people who literally waited in line that long just to order ONE FREAKING EGG TART. WTF!!!

I wasn't that impressed, after an entire year of hype. Now, to be fair, it depends on what you're looking for in a dan tat: their custard is of the lighter, more egg-flavored variety.

Telling myself that I had always wanted to visit this bakery, I decided to tag along.  Lo and behold, as I was walking up Grant Ave, I discovered the my uncle's old store was located directly across the street from this bakery and memories of spending many a Saturday morning munching on treats from this place came flooding back.  Whoa.  How could I have forgotten this gem?\n\nI decided to try one of their famous egg tarts as well as their old wife cake.  Luckily for us, we were told that in a few minutes a fresh batch of the egg tarts would be coming out of the oven.  Talk about good timing!  The egg custard was light in color and texture, very creamy, and wasn't too sweet or too egg-y.  The crust was flaky and rich and oh so good!  Were they good?  Yes!  Where they the best I've ever had?  No, I'm sorry to say.  I've had some that were slightly better, but these are really good.  Are they worth waiting in line for?  Yes.\n\nThe old wife cake is pretty good.  The melon inside was just the right amount for the size of the cake.  The crust was light, tender and flaky.  Let's get real here....only lard can produce something this well made.  This was the lightest version of this pastry I've had in a long time.  Usually it's heavy, dense and the crust is a solid mass of dough.  This is definitely worth trying.\n\nAside from speaking English and Cantonese, one of the ladies working behind the counter also speaks Spanish fluently (she spent some time living in South America).  The ladies were friendly and quite helpful.  On our visit on a Friday night after an early dinner, the line was short.\n\nDefinitely one of the better bakeries in Chinatown and worth a stop if you happen to be in the area.", "author": "Melissa L."}

ALL FIVE barely spoke Mandarin or English. No computers. No automated register. CASH ONLY. Just try imagining anyone, much less an old woman, counting out coins (from not her native country) and I dare you not to get a migraine. I saw one woman split a customer's order into multiple receipts even though the customer didn't ask! WHAAT!?!?!? MILLIONS AND MILLIONS of boxes of UNCOVERED mooncakes--COMPLETELY UNLABELLED. Over a dozen different flavors with 4 options each, MEANING LOTS AND LOTS OF SPECIFIC ORDERS all getting confused. I literally only ordered 2 mooncakes and it took me 15 minutes to get out AFTER waiting 40 minutes to GET IN!!! AND I WAS IN LINE RATHER EARLY!!! The women would try to convince you buy what was in their hand instead of looking through the mountains of mooncakes for the one you ACTUALLY want.

It's updated daily (probably by some shopowner nearby lol). This is important because the shop closes randomly and often. They do so well they can take a whole week off just because it's Memorial Day. SO DO THIS AND SAVE YOURSELF SOME TROUBLE.\n\nThe line wasn't too bad, and you could smell the aroma of egg tarts wafting out the door of the tiny bakery. It's pretty cheap, too. Just over $1 each, and a dozen for over $16. They're pretty big, so it's definitely worth every cent. The egg tart was perfectly crispy and flaky without being drenched in oil. The custard wasn't too heavy and it was perfectly eggy. It's the perfect egg tart. My egg tart standard will never be the same!\n\nI didn't try anything else at that time, and I don't think I'll ever need to.

Granted it was about 11am, but I was pleasantly surprised to see what looked like \"regulars\" at the store ordering dozens of pastries in pink boxes and red plastic wrap bows. I pull out my phone to check in on Yelp, when all of a sudden all the old Chinese ladies give me a look that only my grandma would give me when I pull my phone out at church. Then I remembered, no photography allowed! We ordered a dozen dan tat or egg custard tarts and a moon cake with yolk. The total came out to be $20 something, which is odd because they advertise the dan tat to be $16.20.. so the moon cake was $5? They have batches coming out of the oven every 10 minutes or so, so you'll most likely get one warm!\n\nDan Tat - I don't really like egg custard tarts, but these were sooooo good! The crust is so sweet, flaky, and warm and the custard had the perfect jiggly consistency. I was in dan tat heaven!

I only came by three times between August and November since I don't live nearby, but store owners were on vacation each time. I actually suspect they've been on a continued break the entire 3 months. Honestly, call before you come. If they're on vacation, at least you won't waste your time on a profitless visit!\n\nI thought the last reviewer had interesting points. The first was, there are many great egg tarts  to try, so not eating egg tarts at GGB isn't life changing. One of the other egg tarts I've tried is from Sheng Kee. Maybe they have more than one type? Or maybe they are different at different Sheng Kee stores? Because the one I tried in Cupertino was very much in the same style as this one with the eggy middle and buttery, flakey crust. Sheng Kee actually makes really good egg tarts by the way. Good amount of sweet and the crust is well-baked/not too thick/thin. I also tried a new kind of egg tart though at a bakery in LA, it's a Macao style egg-tart with a harder/more densely baked crust. Also very good. So if GGB is vacationing, be happy that there are many other egg tarts to try elsewhere!\n\nI think what does separate Golden Gate Bakery's egg tarts from other good places like Sheng Kee is basically that they put more sugar in the egg yolk part and more butter in the crust. The crust at Golden Gate Bakery is super, super flakey, like a great croissant. When I bite into a Golden Gate Bakery egg tart, my mouth isn't just satisfied, it does an extra dance. It's that sensation that comes when a taste is very strong, probably on the edge of being too much, but has perfectly balanced itself on the yummy side of that line.\n\nAlso, I think their big peanut butter cookies and their lao puo bing are good too.\n\nTHEY JUST NEED TO BE OPEN SOMETIMES.\n\nAlso, their egg tarts are expensive for egg tarts: I think someone told me $1.75 now per tart? You can usually get these for $1- $1.25 elsewhere.", "author": "Jill F."}

It took a while because people were taking their time making their purchases in the shop.  There isn't much space when you step into the bakery.  I think the max amount of people that should be in there to browse with ease is maybe 5 people and that might be pushing it still.  We picked up some raisin bread for bf's dad.  My bf wanted some sweet bread and I opted for a lemon and raspberry napoleon and a cream puff.\n\n I must say the only thing I love from the bakery is the egg tarts. They were hot when we got them and divine to eat. The best I've had ever.  I can't say the same for the baked goods. I've had better back home in New Orleans.

It's pretty good, but I think that mostly has to do with the fact that it has such high volume that you can always get a hot egg custard.  Almost all  bakeries bake their goods early in the morning and rarely do you get a chance to have this delicious little pastry while its steaming hot out of the oven.\n\nOccasionally you may be able to flag down a hot batch while having dim sum, but other that that, it just doesn't happen.  At Golden Gate Bakery, you are pretty much guaranteed a hot egg custard.  \n\nI don't live in San Francisco, but when I do visit I tend to stay in Union Square, which happens to be very close to Chinatown.  Every time, despite telling myself, I've just eaten or whatever, I find my way to this line, luckily I've never had to wait that long, but it could just be that time difference working in my favor.

Jaw drop.  \n\nEgg Tarts ($16 a dozen, $8 half dozen) - Everyone comes here for the egg tarts.  No one leaves with less than a dozen.  Some people leave with 5 dozen.  It's somewhere in the middle between a Portuguese Egg Tart and a the pie bottom one.  A Portuguese Egg Tart is a smaller egg tart that has a light, crispy, flaky crust, custard and is browned over on top to make it a little sweeter, almost like a creme brulee top.   The pie bottom one is larger, with custard (unbrowned), in a pie like crust... harder, not flaky.  The Golden Gate Bakery Egg Tart is full sized with a crispy, flaky crust, but not as light as a Portuguese Egg Tart.  Best eaten fresh and warm in front of the bakery, but if you pop them in the oven at home at 300 for 12 minutes, it's like fresh baked goodness all over again.  \n\nCoconut Macaroons ($6 a dozen, $3 a half dozen) - An underrated star, I consider these equally as good as the egg tarts, but way less hyped.  Shaped like a large kiss drop, light, airy but a tad moist inside, and they have a fun crunch that holds, even if you choose to eat them five days later.  \n\nSome swear by their Almond Cookies... I've never had them.  They also sell various Moon Cakes.  With or without yolk, double yolk, mixed nut, red bean, green bean, etc. There's about 10 varieties and then you can choose with or without yolk in the middle.    \n\nThere is always a line outside.

We quickly got in line, which was comparable to the line at Bi-Rite, and finally got in the bakery after about 25 minutes. \n\nThe inside of the bakery is super cluttered. You can't even go inside half the bakery, because it is so full of stuff (boxes, bags, junk (for lack of a better word)). The bakery case is in front, and features all the goodies, but you have to request the egg custard tarts, which I am assuming are being baked off and were not out yet when we were there. There was probably no time to refill the egg custard tarts in the case!\n\nWe ordered six egg custard tarts, two egg custard buns, and banh bo (not sure what the English term for it is, but it's like a sponge-y white rice-flour-based cake). We also got some vanilla sponge cake with pineapple jelly in the middle. I should have gotten some almond cookies, but we were so distracted. \n\nThe egg custard tarts were so flake-y, crisp, and perfectly sweet (but not too sweet), while the actual egg custard still retained the egg taste but sweet and delicious. There's no way to describe it. The custard is still slightly jiggly but the outside tart shell is perfectly crisp. Pretty cool. I love the darkened lightly burnt crust on top, yum. Truly the best egg custard tarts I've ever had. \n\n$1.40 per tart, which isn't too bad, considering that macarons cost about $1.50 at least for a tiny cookie the size of your thumbnail.

One day on my lunch break, I finally decided to pop in to see what the fiasco was all about. \n\nConsidering that it was noon on a weekday, the line was quite ridiculous. I probably waited a good 20 minutes just to get eggtarts to-go. I also heard that they have extremely inconsistent business hours, I guess they're just that good to open whenever they feel like it and still keep people coming.\n\nWhen I first saw the price, I was quite surprised. I don't think I've ever paid more than a dollar for an eggtart before. Although overpriced, I will reluctantly say that they were worth it. Such a smooth, perfectly sweet custard and flakey crust, these things were absolutely scrumptious. Very reminiscent of the eggtarts in Hong Kong. \n\nBeing the good friend that I am, I bought a box to take home for my friend and had the smell of freshly baked eggtarts torture me for the rest of the afternoon.", "author": "Becky M."}

I'm probably sipping on so much haterade right now it's not funny anymore. I've walked by and after 10+ times of being in the area and attempting to check it out, only to fail miserably. When I saw the line pop up within the small Chinatown street, I knew it was finally destiny to determine if this place had it better than Tao Yuen Pastry (Oakland, CA).\n\nI tried this place practically two weeks ago view my photo of their Custard Tarts and Vanilla Cream Bun (http://instagram.com/p/i2C1ULnh23/).\n\nLet's start with the Cream Bun. The bread is moist, the vanilla filling is airy but the subtle shavings of coconut didn't rub me the right way. Had they mentioned coconut from the get-go I wouldn't have ordered but you gotta be open somehow, right?\n\nFinally the battle of the bay area Custard Tarts. If you love your egg tarts with a souffl\u00e9 consistency, then here's the 49ers of egg tarts for you. Skinny next to nothing crust with a whole lot of airy-eggy goodness shining through. The Raiders (Tao Yuen) holds a soft spot for me, not just for childhood purposes but the idea of a tart having two essential elements: A nice core ingredient (in this case a panna cotta like gelatinous texture) with layers of thick flakey crust holding the contents.\n\nI prefer the latter and after hearing (and tasting) these overpriced mini treats ($1.50+ for each egg tart and the cream bun was a dollar). Ended up spending almost $15.00 of less than a dozen with a cream bun. As opposed to across the bay, it's a few cents cheaper and the quality makes all the difference.\n\nI'm giving this place a 2.5 solely on lack of accessibility, wait time, pricing and quality of product. Sorry GGB, maybe you were good or I visited on a bad day? Either way, I hope the egg tarts will improve in the future. Cheers.", "author": "Ryan M."}

It's special because it has the ability to literally make or break my trips to SF depending on whether or not it's open when I'm there.\n\nThis place is called Golden Gate Bakery... and I'm unabashedly addicted to their egg tarts.\n\nI've eaten hundreds of egg tarts in my lifetime (it's expected being Canto with Dim Sum and all), and this place has by far the best egg tarts I've ever had. The hype is real.\n\nThe crust supporting this large tart is thin yet incredibly flaky. The pale yellow egg custard middle is cooked to perfect consistency. The eggy flavor is pronounced and complemented by a subtle sweetness as opposed to other places where sweetness is all you seem to taste. It's an egg tart, not a sugar tart. \n\nAt $1.40 a pop (cash only too!) it's not cheap. But it's worth every penny. And the lines out the door they have every single day throughout the day is a testament to that.\n\nI really give this place 4.5 stars, docking half a star simply because they seem to close shop whenever they feel like it. Of all the times I go to SF, it's only been open during 60-70% of those trips. Fear not, however, there is literally a site, fan-made I assume, dedicated to letting you know if Golden Gate Bakery is open which is updated daily around noon. I'm not lying.

Fate would have me in the area this past Friday so I thought I would finally give it a try. \n\nThe first thing I notice about this bakery is that they run it like a drug operation. The lights were off, the doors were locked, and a sign was posted saying that they were closed for vacation. A winding line was forming outside. I thought they were closed, but after a few minutes, I noticed an old woman unlocking the door from time to time to accept cash only for freshly baked boxes of dan tat (ordered 1-2 dozen at a time). It took a good half hour to get a batch since it seemed like they were only producing a couple dozen at a time. If that's not shady, I don't know what is. \n\nThe dan tat were piping hot and as fresh as could be. As I bit into one, I realized what all the fuss was about. The crust was perfectly flaky, the custard was silky smooth and not too sweet. They made a believer out of me.

For those going on Yelp to find out what's good in SFO - be warned - DON'T LINE UP for this! If the line is short (as in 2 to 3 people tops ahead of you) then go for it. But otherwise look away and walk the other direction.  If you're still going to be a sucker and line up anyway, make sure you have enough cash. They are CASH ONLY. We spent $35 on a dozen egg tarts and two moon cakes. People ahead of us paid $75 and $150 albeit they had 3 or so boxes of moon cakes and egg tarts on hand.\n\nIf you are from Calgary, just eat at the Grand Central on Center Street. They have the EXACT same egg tarts minus the hype and the wait. \n\nIn fairness, the egg tart and moon cake were not bad, they were in fact good. But not good enough to wait in line for... honestly we waited for almost 3 hours in line for this and it's NOT (emphasis on NOT) worth it. I would line up 10 minutes tops (15 would be pushing it) for these. \n\nGood things: Food was good but nothing to call home about. Certainly nothing to line up for whatsoever. Egg tarts were cheap at $18 per dozen or $1.50 per piece. Allegedly, at least according to the locals waiting in line,  the savoury treats were even better than the egg tart - I can't say as they were not available that day. You make new friends waiting in line. \n\nBad things: Service sucks! Did I mention yet that the line moves slower than molasses???! Inside, they literally write your receipt down on paper - why they can't make the process more efficient beyond me.  As in think of the most inefficient place you've ever been to, multiple the slowness by 7, and that would still be faster than the service here. Moon cakes were expensive at $7-$8 per piece (yes, per piece as in like one hockey puck). And to rub salt into our wounds, it turned out we were lining up for savoury pastries that weren't even available that day, and they had no warnings that  these were not available.The biggest delays were they were pretty much baking things to order (once they run out, decent bakeries will let you know. This one will actually bake things as people order and trap you into waiting until you have no choice but to walk out with something in a pink box anyway). One more bad thing, cash only. \n\nI wish I listened to the guy here who commented that \"life is short\" to be wasting time on this. I feel so embarrassed we spent that much time waiting...

In fact, when people build up a place and it's just okay, even if it's good, it's still a disappointment.  \n\nThe place is super tiny and the way it's set up, you can't see the products until it's time to order, and they had like 5 things, moon cakes, egg tarts, egg muffins, sticky rice, and a few other items.  Maybe because it was around 7pm and they sold out of other stuff.  The glass cases are blocked by the line of people in front and I had no idea what they were selling until it was time to order.  The prices are also unlisted and for $1.35 for a sticky rice ball, it was pretty pricey as far as Chinatown bakeries are concerned.  \n\nService was standard for Chinatown, which is not saying much.  The sticky rice with red bean was good and the muffin thing I tried was pretty good too.  It tasted fresh and smelled good.  Maybe I'm not blown away because I didn't have the egg tart.  But I'm not from Southern China and never really cared for those.  Oh well.  It was a good pit stop after dinner and I will definitely try the egg tart next time.", "author": "Lin G."}

After this amazing lunch, we decided to walk it off and strolled through the streets of Chinatown.  As we are walking, we spotted a long line waiting at a bakery.  Of course we stood on line and asked questions later,\n\nTurns out this line was a wait for what's considered some of the best Egg Tarts aka Dan Tat around.  We waited and joked and laughed with some of the people waiting and by the time we were at the counter we were well prepared to order correctly (images of Seinfeld Soup Nazi were floating in my head).\n\nOnce in this small, wonderful smelling happy little bakery it was amazing to simply watch the hustle and bustle of the staff running around taking orders.  As we are ordering, there are constant fresh sweets flying out of the ovens and into their pink bakery boxes.  They even cut two flaps in the boxes to let the steam vent, that's how fresh this is.\n\nWe ordered 6  Dan Tat's and a few rice cake pancakes as well as a few macaroons.  The pancakes and macaroons were sold out with another batch coming in about 10 - 15 minutes, Soooooo, what to do while waiting for 15 minutes when you have a box of Dan Tat's in hand, WE ATE THEM!!!   I have had egg tarts before and as a baked good they are generally delicious, these were incredibly delicious.  Flaky warm crust, hot and creamy sweet egg custard filling and a somewhat firm texture across the top of this 2 inch beauty!  Was it worth the 20 minute wait, definitely!\n\nAfter 15 minutes and a so much happiness in my mouth and stomach, it was time to return for the pancake and macaroons.  I skipped the entire line, found the sweet nice lady behind the counter (spoke perfect English) and walked out with two pancakes and two macaroons. \n\nFirst up, the pancake.  It is a mochi type texture with a sweet filling.  Absolutely delicious, a bit chewy sort of like taffy and in all a great intermezzo to the macaroons.\n\nThere are so many reviews that mention the Dan Tats and I agree they are wonderful, however, the Macaroons may have been one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth!  Fresh out of the oven, these sweet small magical concoctions are little bits of heaven that melt in your mouth!  I have never had a warm,right from the oven macaroon.  Whatever you do, do not leave there without a half dozen of these. \n\nI can not wait to be back in San Francisco again, this bakery will always be on my list of places to stop by when in town!", "author": "Adam K."}

Your best bet is to find meter parking which is limited. I suggest taking public transit if feasible. \n\nWait time: This place is known to close whenever they feel like it. They make enough money where they don't need to stay open year round. I suggest calling beforehand to make sure they're open. After calling them on a Sunday afternoon to confirm that they were open, I waited in line for about 20 minutes before placing my order. Typically, you can expect to wait anywhere between 20-30 minutes. \n\nService: They are fast! When you come in, they just ask you straight out what you want and they pack your order immediately.

I would recommend to let it cool down a little if you're getting a fresh baked batch. It was difficult eating it when it was piping hot. Once it's cooled down a little, it was the ideal time to eat where it's not too hot or not too cold, just right.\n\nThey sell for $1.75 a piece which is pretty pricey. I wouldn't wait anymore than 30 minutes for these though. I would say if you find an egg tart that's just as good elsewhere, bring it home and reheat it a little.

I guess it really depends on how you like your dan tats. And this place is definitely the place to get your dan tat/custard tart/egg tart craving!\n\nWell since Chinese New Years just passed this year, I figured the bakery would be open so I went by because the last three times I have attempted to go here, they were closed for vacation. Guess business is that good that they can close any time they want! So I guess that's a downside to this place. (minus one)\n\nBut other than that, I will gladly wait 30 minutes in line for some giant, hot, silky custard tarts! So good when it's freshly made, but still good when it isn't (just stick it back in your oven or eat it cold). The custard tart isn't too sweet, just a perfect texture that melts in your mouth. The crust is kind of oily and flakey, but nothing wrong with that. One bite, and you'll get crumbs from the crust but I think the important thing is the giant yellow center! \n\nIt's 1.25 for one (pretty reasonable) and 15 for a dozen. Not bad, though I wish it was discounted if you were buying more. The ladies that work there, move fast so the line moves quick.

Every time I was actually free to go, they would always be closed. Every. Time. I eventually discovered a site (http://www.is-the-golden-gate-bakery-open-today.com/) that is updated at noon DAILY to tell me when Golden Gate was opened, and it was pretty much always accurate.  My feening for the taste of potentially the best egg custard I'd ever tasted grew bigger and bigger as the days went by.. \n\nThen finally, FINALLY, I went on a day where they happened to be opened and lord oh heaven the line was only a handful of people out the door. As I was waiting in line, I didn't see any of the egg tarts on display and I swore I thought I went crazy thinking they sold out or something - HOW CAN IT BE!? But luckily, they just serve it hot out of the oven so they don't display it on the storefront - oh you sneaky bakery owners you. \n\nAnd then oh.. the taste, that first bite...into the fluffy, hot, flaky, light egg tart...(there is a pool of drool on my desk now) it was everything I wished for and more. For better of worse, I only bought one. Better because it lived up to the hype and was well worth the wait to finally try the best egg tarts evar. For worse because as impeccably delicious as it was, and as painful as it was to have only one serving, I would have not stopped at eating no less than 5 if there were 5+ tarts in front of me. Extremely worth it for all the little Asian kids who were tricked into eating any other Chinese bakery egg tart in their life..it's all been a lie.\n\nBut seriously they have stupid hours and when they are 'closed,' I am imagining the owners secretly sitting in the back of the bakery, eating all the tasty egg tarts to their hearts' content while the rest of the world suffers and wimpers from missing out on the beauty that is Golden Gate Bakery egg tarts.", "author": "Allie Y."}

When I think of them, I think of soft crusts (not in a good way) and cold, dense, eggy custard. Despite my inherent bias, one bite into the egg tart at Golden Gate Bakery completely changed my mind. The egg tart was warm, fresh out of the oven. The crust was delicate and flakey, somewhat like a napoleon. The egg custard was soft, silky, and not too sweet. It was by far the best (non-portuguese style) egg tart I've ever had, and the first I have actually enjoyed. After trying the egg tarts at Golden Gate Bakery, I can now say I am an egg tart fan.   \n\nMy Advice\n1) Expect a line - Don't expect to get in and out of there quickly. \n2) Buy more than 1 - you won't regret it.  \n3) Bring cash. No cards accepted. \n4) Speak up when it's your turn. It's a mad house in there. Don't expect other customers will politely make sure you've been served first.\n\n**UPDATE** \nI have docked a star for their unprofessional, unreliable hours. \n\nRecently, I wanted to serve GG's delicious egg tarts for dessert at a dinner party. On Fridays, they are supposed to be open until 8pm, but when I arrived at 6pm, they were inexplicably closed. Adding insult to injury, I had rented a Zip car explicitly for that trip. Very frustrating. (I ended up going to nearby AA Bakery for my egg tarts.) \n\nApparently my frustration is nothing new. I have learned about a website where you can check whether GG Bakery is really open, regardless of their posted hours. It's sad that there's a need for a site like this.

Once it cools down, it doesn't tastes as good. Just pop them in the oven again, and it's good to eat again. $1.30 a piece but you just got to try it once.\n\nWe also tried their coconut tarts, raisin bread, peanut and sesame mochi, almond cookies. Everything else was just average but very fresh.My mother loved their Peanut sesame mochi. She said it was so fresh and soft you can literally taste the freshness of the fresh ground peanuts. \n\nI love their old school wrapping.

After waited 40 minutes, my family decided to go to dinner. I got out of the line to lock the door, thinking about giving up. But since my family decided to go down the block for dinner, I tried asking the \"nice\" lady if I can get back in line (I was only out of the line about 2 minutes) She was so nice in telling me where to go for good foods while I was in line, but when I asked if I can get back in space, she said \"I think you lost your space\" aarrggg... B*tCh! But I guess I understand.. but the least she can do was ask how many I wanted and she can order it for me and I can pay her back. \nSo to make a long story short, the first night, I didn't get any. When I got up to the line they wouldn't take my order of 6 egg tarts, Minimum order, 2 dozens.(Apparently they had closed for 2 months to go back to Hong Kong, And that was the first night they opened, and they had very high expectations. Other days, I'm sure you can get 1 or 2 or 6 egg tarts)\n  Uhh, what?? They yelled at me for touching one of their bread on the counter that was covered with plastic bag, How the heck am I going to know if it's soft or what is it if I don't touch it.\nThe second night, we returned to Chinatown, This time it was less people in line, The ladies recognized me as I whisper to my mom to say that lady yelled at me last night and I yelled back.. lol.. Must be the magic of Mom, but since we had to wait for the egg tarts to be done baking, they ha long, friendly conversation with Mom and I.

Whenever I wait in line for this place, and yes there is ALWAYS a line and its unavoidable, some tourists are always in line and are curious to what is so great about this place. I always recommend the egg tarts because its what they're known for. They're quite pricey for one stupid egg tart, but it tastes like heaven. I kid you not, it melts in your mouth. They're $1.80 believe. I've tried something else from the bakery and it just can't be compared to the egg tarts. \n\nThe line is pretty ridiculous. It's about a 30 minute wait to get in and if you're lucky, it'll be shorter. This place is always on vacation as well. They probably go on vacation every month with the amount of money they make lol. But I've also heard they have really bad health issues in the back of the bakery, but no regrets. Their egg tarts are a must buy and I never have to use the bathroom after eating anything from there.\n\nTIP: Take advantage when you're buying because it's going to be a long wait again if you want to buy more.

The owner told me to come ten minutes later, and as I finished my breakfast around 8:50, there's already a line outside the store. I spent another 30min in line and bought a dozen of egg tarts.

I'm really not into super mushy stuff, but this I can definitely make an expection for.  When you take a bite of this delicious and savory and moist and warm custard you feel like you're in heaven (seriously!)  I've never tasted anything so delicious ever!

They had other good pastries (don't know the names of the stuff) but everything was really good.  And I really liked how everything was nice and warm so if you wanted to eat it right away, you weren't biting into cold hard bread. :P\n\nI definitely suggest you come here if you're in SF, but beware of the line!

The taste is very good and the texture is good.  This tart does well in that you cannot complain about and everything is right.\n\nBut to wait in line for a while, and to pay $1.40 for an egg tart when you can get them in Oakland for 60 cents fresh, without the wait makes no sense to me.  And to be honest, Oakland egg tarts are painfully good.   \n\nI had this egg tart fresh and wasn't too impressed, but for the sake of the people around me, I acted as though I crossed one item off the bucket list.  As for the price , compared to american bakeries, a $1.40 for a pastry is hardly anything to complain about, but it is just the idea that chinese bakeries in Oakland is so much better. Try hong fook on 9th and webster.\n\nSo that loses two stars.\n\nThe other is their other selection.  Again my standard is the bakery in Oakland's Chinatown which has at least 50 variety of baked goods, almost which you cannot screw up your choice..  Golden Gate maybe 20 and they do all of them quite terribly.  I recommend avoiding all of them except the sandwich looking thing with egg custard.  The napolean was overly sweet, without flavor and dry.  The custard puff was simply disgusting.\n\nSo that loses another star.\n\nFunny, I was reading another 2 star review and the person was from Oakland.  (they were comparing to Tao Yuan).This place really really is good.  But why wait and pay the extra amount when you can get the same, if not different.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-01-03", "description": "The story of my experience at Golden Gate Bakery (on Grant Ave, btw Jackson St and Pacific St) begins 45 minutes earlier at the Good Mong Kok Bakery (1039 Stockton St, btw Washington St and Jackson St), a location west-southwest and ten minutes away on foot. Confused? Let me explain.\n\nIt was mid-afternoon on December 31, 2014 - New Year's Eve - and Chinatown was bustling as I had last remembered it, 16 years ago. I was visiting from out of town and my brother (who still lives in the city) had luckily snagged a parking spot somewhere on Clay St, so we proceeded on foot towards the Good Mong Kok Bakery, as we were curious about its high reviews on Yelp in the single-$ category. We arrived at about 2:45, purchased fifteen pieces of dim sum to go, but learned that the bakery had completely sold out of dan tat (the golden egg custard in a pastry crust).\n\n\"No worries,\" said my brother, \"I know a place where dan tat is their specialty.\" And so, with the aid of Google maps, we meandered towards Golden Gate Bakery. We must have walked by the bakery - a small store front wedged between two large shops - at least twice before we looked up from our phones to gape at bizarre scene in front of us. The Golden Gate Bakery was closed: the lights were off, the interior was dark, no one appeared to be inside, and there was a sign posted on the front door, \"Closed for Vacation.\"\n\nNonetheless, there were at least fifteen people waiting in front, standing in line along the sidewalk.\n\nMy brother and I looked at each other, shrugged, and got in line at the end. We couldn't see very well from where we were standing, but it appeared that there actually was someone in the store. This mysterious person would open the door just enough to extend a hand to accept some cash from customers at the front of the line, then close the door. A few minutes later, the door would open again to reveal a pair of arms stacked with flat pink cake boxes, wrapped in pine twine. The paying customers happily relieved those arms of said burden before quickly leaving, allowing the line of people to inch forward. With nothing better to do, we searched through the Yelp reviews on this store and noticed a trend: apparently, long lines aren't unusual at this location, and the shop tends to go \"on vacation\" quite often.\n\nBy then, there were at least seven people ahead of us and five more people had lined up behind us. As we neared the front of the line, we noticed the form of an older woman inside the closed shop. She didn't speak, but made eye contact with certain customers of her own choosing. Her silent gaze constituted an unspoken question, and the customers responded accordingly with their fingers. Some signaled \"2\", others \"4\". When she looked at us, we indicated \"1\". She nodded and walked away.\n\nSoon enough, the door opened again: the arms appeared with boxes, customers quickly divested those arms of aforementioned boxes, then said customers departed - allowing us to inherit our new position as Customer #3 at the front of the line. The older woman opened the door and spoke in Chinese Cantonese to the Customers #1 and #2. When she turned to us, she paused before uttering, \"Eighteen dollar, one dozen.\" Thus enlightened, we handed over a twenty-dollar bill, which she readily accepted before closing the door and walking away.\n\nNow, at this vantage point, we could see more clearly through the darkened glass: the shop resembled a narrow hallway and the back room was dimly lit, where we espied another older lady carrying a tray full of pastries. She came into the front of the store, assembled some cake boxes, and starting arranging the pastries in the newly constructed containers. Once the boxes were filled, she painstakingly hand-wrapped each box with twine; using a pair of scissors, she then cut four venting flaps in the corners of the lid of each box. Finally done, she handed the boxes to the first woman, before retreating into the bowels of the shop.\n\nThe first lady opened the front door again and began distributing the boxes. We accepted our package of one-dozen dan tat, told her to keep the change, and turned around to walk past the line of waiting people behind us. The two younger customers (who accepted their order of four-dozen dan tat) were merrily digging into their boxes to get at the lovely, golden goodness, which they then greedily crammed into their mouths. I'm sure they did that just to spite the others who were still waiting in line. And as we walked away, we heard someone else (who had just arrived) exclaim, \"Oh, but they're closed...!\" We grinned and proceeded along without comment.\n\nThus ended my first experience of purchasing dan tat at the Golden Gate Bakery. Was it good, you ask? Was it worth it, you inquired? And what of the dim sum at Good Mong Kok? All valid questions, dear readers, but that's another story altogether.", "author": "Alan H."}

As someone who loves trying great food and tries to be aware of food hot spots wherever I go, I haven't even heard of the Golden Gate Bakery until I was vacationing in San Francisco's Chinatown,mere blocks away from the place, and my sister came back with a whole box of the Egg Custard Tarts.\n\n\"I waited almost an hour for these\", she proudly and happily proclaimed while showing the family what's inside the box.\n\nLooking in, I saw some Egg Custard Tarts, or as us Chinese call it, \"Dan Tat\" and nothing else.  \n\nNow, usually, I wouldn't be too impressed or excited by seeing \"Dan Tats\" since I'm not the biggest fan of them.  I will eat them if I have nothing else to munch on but otherwise I would eat other stuff if I have a choice.  But hearing how my sister kept saying that are usually almost always lines that are half an hour or more.  And how the wait is usually made longer because every other person seems to buy boxes of them at a time, I was convinced I would regret it if I didn't try some before heading back to NYC.\n\nDAMN!!!!  THESE WERE AMAZING!!!\n\nI ate these while it was still warm, and it had just the most thin yet flaky outer crust, with a smooth,semi sweet, soft custard inside that is so moist that it still jiggles a little if you shake it.  Normally, I find most Dan Tat's crust to be too dry and thick for my preference and the custard to be more thicker and more firm.  I much rather prefer the way they make it here, and apparently so does everyone else on that long line.  I found out that many people take out a few just to eat it piping hot right outside the bakery.  This is done because the turnover rate of the tarts are so fast, that new batches are constantly being made and put out.  Eating it right outside ensures that you are possibly tasting them mere minutes after it was baked.  Now that is fresh.\n\nHell, my sister bought enough to last us the next two or three days during our trip, and even cold or reheated, these beats the pants off any of the fresh ho hum egg custards tarts that I've eaten in NYC or anywhere else that I've tried so far in the USA. \n\n It's the only Dan Tat that I've ever had a craving for.  Even now, after 3 months since I had them, I still think of them sometimes.  If you are in the area, I highly recommend you find a little time, get in line, and let this little bakery change your view of Egg Custard Tarts.  I know it did to mine.\n\nJust be aware that this place have very haphazard, random vacations days throughout the year.  There are many reports of them being close for days and even weeks without warning, leaving disappointed people standing in front of a closed gate with a handwritten note saying they are on vacation.  That's what happened to my sister's first attempt to eat here on a previous trip a year prior to this.  \n\nThis happens so often that there was even fan created websites and facebook pages to tell others if and what time they are open on any given day so people won't need to take a long trip there for no reason. Crazy, right?  \n\nUse the following links to see if they are open if you plan to head out here.\n\nweb page: http://www.is-the-golden-gate-bakery-open-today.com/\n\nfb page:  https://www.facebook.com/pages/Is-the-Golden-Gate-Bakery-Open-Today/394882013908745", "author": "Wing L."}

It's just sad but having to grow up between Hong Kong and San Francisco, you know Golden Gate is overrated, overpriced and not worth the wait. It is as close as the quality of egg tart you can get widely in Hong Kong, but it is nothing more than that because egg tart is a very common pastry in Hong Kong, it really shouldn't be this expensive. My parents used to get them for us occasionally until I had encountered an incident and realized how rude these people are, so they are not only rude to non-chinese speakers, they are in fact just rude. After that, I told my parents not to get the egg tarts from this place any more, it's not worth it just because they make egg tart a little better than other average Hong Kong Style pastries in San Francisco.

The silky smooth filling rounds out what just may be the epitome of the perfect egg custard tart.\n\nAs for the pineapple bun, I was actually kind of disappointed at first by the diminutive size; the bun is definitely smaller than your average pineapple bun. But as they say, size doesn't always matter, especially if you're talking about a pineapple bun whose bun component is the texture, consistency, and richness of a well-made croissant. Topped with a perfectly flaky and buttery shortbread-like topping, this is the pineapple bun that stands alone at the pinnacle of bun glory. \n\nSo even if you didn't read any of what I have written above, my take-home message is this: go to Golden Gate Bakery and order the egg custard tart and pineapple bun. Once you recover from the sheer ecstasy that you'll be feeling after having something so pleasingly delicious in your mouth (that's what she said), you will thank me.", "author": "Kevin C."}

The tarts are all that...warm from the oven, they melted in my mouth. The rest of our pastry haul couldn't compare. The sponge cake roll was good but undistinguished, and the sesame ball was chewier than a radial tire. The napoleon was crunchier than I expected, and the sticky rice was a bit bland.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-03-04", "description": "Yes they're good. However, they have multitudes of issues. The lines are long when they're open. Now that you need to feed the meters on Sunday afternoons means that it costs you more to wait in line. The other issue is just the ridiculous prices they're charging - about twice what other competitive bakeries charge. And of course the oddest thing is how they manage to be \"on vacation\" about every other time I walk by.\n\nIt's Chinatown, so you know the service is going to be an adventure.  I don't hold it against a place like this when the line becomes amorphous once you get to the counter and the person who waited behind you tries to jump ahead of you. I have had Chinatown clerks notice I was first and refuse to serve a line jumper ahead of me, so it's not as if they're not aware.\n\nSo in short, the sign that says \"The Best in Town\" (and wasn't this place shown in a BofA commercial with a banker repeating that line?) may be accurate. However, it's only marginally better than other places where you'll pay about half as much, where you'll only wait minutes rather than half an hour, and where they're probably going to be open. It's worth a try is you have the time and they're open. They're prices are high, but they're still pretty inexpensive treats. However, if any of these things are an issue for you, Napolean Super Bakery on Stockton (or Oakland Chinatown) are almost as good without those issues.", "author": "yp w."}

I love my chinese bakeries and I love how traditional this bakery is. Everything feels like it's straight out of the stories you hear about Chinatown. It's certainly a fun place to visit. Give it a shot...the custard is usually nice warm and thick.(For those who don't know, an egg tart is a flaky hong kong dessert that has a crispy crust and a filing/middle of egg custard.) The only thing I could imagine that wasn't excellent was its crust. \n\nThis place is a must if you're in SF's chinatown. Don't overhype it and make yourself thing it'll rock your world, but definitely come to eat something delicious.", "author": "Dawei L."}

I had FOUR different types of egg tarts on the same day to figure out why GGB egg tarts were so great and it's clear why. I don't know what they do, but the taste and texture are top-notch and very consistent. GGB egg tarts also had the most custard out of all the tarts and they're amazing when eaten fresh. If reheating, put into a 320 F oven for 12 minutes.\n\nThe macaroons were also awesome - make sure you microwave if it gets cold and hard. Mooncake was also pretty good, but really expensive.\n\nGreat first time experience! At $1.35 per egg tart, that is almost twice as expensive as the egg tart from Super Napolean Bakery (which is really good too!), but it's worth it if you can tolerate the long line.", "author": "Jason T."}

The line moves quickly though, and people watching was fun!\n\nI ordered the custard tart which was served warm, right out of the oven, not too eggy, not too sweet, and a lovely mouth feel. I wished I'd bought two! Total comfort food. I also got an assortment of other cakes from the window. I couldn't tell you what they're called, unfortunately, but my mix included some barely sweet steamed buns and cookies redolent of coconut.

This was my experience...\n\nIt was a cold Sunday afternoon and it also happened to be Chinese New Year. My bf and I were feeling festive so we went in search of some authentic dim sum. Our search brought us to...Chinatown! I recently read about Golden Gate Bakery on some list from 7x7 and kept it in my \"must try\" brain folder. I thought, \"yesssss this is happening\"\n\nWe navigate to Golden Gate Bakery and find player parking. Love it when that happens. Feeling good already! About to eat some egg tarts!\n\nWe get in line. A looooong line, which makes a u-shape on the street. It's cold. I'm in heels. Firecrackers are going off everywhere. My genuine excitement for amazing egg tarts outweighed all of these unfortunate factors! I wait patiently. About 20-25 mins later, we're inside the store! We get: 4 egg tarts, 1 honey bbq pork bun, 1 mochi-like thing, and to my severe disappointment, they ran out of sesame balls and i wasn't going to wait 30-mins for them to be ready. or was i???\n\nEverything they serve was either piping hot or very warm. How do they do it?? \n\nAnyway, we pay for our things and scurry back to the car so that we can sit & devour our goodies. My first impression of the egg tarts...meh. It was really hot and the egg custard was still sorta jiggly, but the crust was perfection. My boyfriend really really really loved his bbq pork bun though. I mean, he LOVED it.\n\nAt this point, we still hadn't eaten any dim sum so we walk a couple blocks to pick some up. 15 minutes later we're back at the car and my bf says \"I'm just looking to see if the line is any shorter\" In my head im saying \"are you crazy\" but what i actually say is \"if you wanna go back, im down\" like i said, he REALLY loved that pork bun. \n\nHere we are back in line. Still cold. Still in heels. But this time, it only takes 5 minutes before we're inside the store! Woohoo! And guess what! The sesame balls are ready!!! My favorite!!! This time we pick up: 3 sesame balls, 1 bbq pork bun, and 1 curry pork bun. \n\nI really like sesame balls, and these ones are awesome. Not super oily, crispy and chewy in all the right places, just the right amount of red bean filling. *drool*\n\nLater on that night, I had one more egg tart. By the time I ate this one, it cooled down. Whoa ho ho...WHOLE DIFFERENT ballgame. It was the best egg tart, ever. Yeah. It was.", "author": "Krystle I."}

Save for the milky white filling and non-br\u00fbl\u00e9e surface, Golden Gate's version is a close substitute for the Portuguese egg tart. Its puff pastry case is crisp and flaky, yet does not crumble easily. Its custard is sweet, creamy and smooth with the right texture. Overall a delicious, fragrant treat that rivals any egg tart back in Hong Kong.\n\nLonging for more familiar Chinese treats, I bought a pineapple bun to try on my way home. To my pleasant surprise, Golden Gate's version was light and fluffy, and extremely crunchy in texture.

I personally hadn't heard of this place until the day I stepped foot into it. We must have arrived pretty early because this crazy line everyone speaks of hadn't really formed yet. Then again... I spent the past ten minutes chasing my friend through Chinatown as she was swiftly maneuvering her way through the crowds in order to get in line for us... haha. The store smelled delicious, I was so excited when I got my cute pink box, my only regret is not eating them right there and then. I could just imagine the taste of the hot fresh egg custard being cradled by a crisp fluffy exterior... but there was no place to sit and rest, so my box of treats was left unopened until I got home later that night. \n\nBy then, they were soggy. I was sad. No more crispy hot warm tender amazing in my mouth. I think I put one in the toaster oven. Overall, the custard part was nice and creamy. Next time though... I'm eating it right away.", "author": "Christine L."}

It really is ridiculous because it's almost an hour before you get in the door...why? Well, the women in the bakery apparently don't believe in calculators, or the cash register, everything is done by head calculations on a piece of paper.  THIS IS WHAT'S CAUSING THE LONG LINE!!! AND the fact that some people in there are ordering like 10 boxes (probably to resell it somewhere else for twice the price!!!)  Who dares eat 10 boxes of egg tarts???  \n\nAnyway, on to my wait in this ridiculous line...this lady in front of me kept making fun of me for waiting in line for moon cakes.  She said it's not that great and she can't believe I'll wait in line for such expensive moon cake, she said it's around $9.50 each.  I was like \"whoa...that's pricey\"  Then she kept going on and on....giving me the evil eye...whatever lady!  So I finally get to the front and this stupid lady ended up ordering the very same moon cake she has been dissing about!!! WHAT??? AND it's not $9.50 each, it is IF you want like 4 egg yolks on your cake, I only wanted one and it's around $5-7 depending on what you get.  Not bad...more expensive than most but it is delicious! AND the egg tarts...OMG, so good!!! but you gotta eat it fresh, like right there.  I see now why people wait in line for the egg tarts, it really is THAT GOOD!!!  \n\nLastly, watch out for the lady from the next store to the right, she gets very upset if you line up in front of her store.  AND don't buy anything there either, she charges like 3x more than the store 2 doors down.  She tried to sell me this pendant for $10, then when I bargain it down to like half, she's like NO.

You'll probably be standing in front of me. \n\nI'm not generally a huge fan of egg tarts or eggy tasting custards, but this is just right. Ethereally light custard and very little egg flavor with a touch of sweetness, enfolded in thin layer upon layer of delicate, crisp, flaky pastry. They always come hot and fresh, and it's great when steam rises from the tarts when you take a bite. Had some damn good egg tarts in Hong Kong, and I'd say these are still among my favorite. \n\nTheir other pastries are also delicious. The mochi, rolled in coconut and filled with peanuts, is always fresh and soft with just the right amount of chewy resistance, and the right amount of sweetness. Their little curry filled savory pies are good, but kind of skimp on the beef and veggies in the middle. The red bean moon cakes when they have them are also delish, but on the oilier side. Had a barbecue pork pastry there once, but that was cold and didn't taste the freshest, so I did not repeat. \n\nI can't tell if speaking Cantonese gets me better or worse service. Maybe it's just because I understand the cartloads of sass being flung back and forth by the old ladies who work there, between themselves and at customers. It's usually pretty entertaining. \n\n**Tips**\n- Going on a weekday evening generally guarantees no lines \n- This place is cash only\n- Don't let the old ladies talk you into buying other pastries that you don't want - especially the large gummy looking ones - I was coerced into this once and did not enjoy the experience\n- If you get only one thing, of course get the egg tart", "author": "Selina K."}

Not that I am complaining because I don't mind the extra crust holding the soft but fluffy custard in the middle. A bite into this heavenly goodness--first into the smooth custard that's almost oozing out, then into the flaky crust shattering into little shards--and it makes sense why this is so popular.\n\nBut I refuse to declare this the best in town, at least not yet. The crust was flaky alright but it lacks the smell of butter. They probably didn't use it because butter is more expensive than say, shortening. At $1.35 a tart, I see only a very slight reason why GG Bakery's is better than competitors such as AA Bakery which only sells their egg tarts for $1.

The egg custard is the thickest and deepest that I've ever had. Custard is nice and fluffy, but a bit too soft for my preference.  I would prefer my custard to have a little texture to them.  An example of what I mean: When I pick up a tart by the rim of the crust, I would prefer it not to bend and break apart on me.\n\nI also ordered myself an Apple Roll.  Pretty much just a pound cake roll with glazed apples, just as you'd find in an apple pie.  I liked. \n\nGolden Gate Bakery is definitely worth a visit to while in Chinatown, but in terms of the best Danh Tats in S.F., well that distinction is a bit too high in my eyes.  \n\nAll in all, not THE best...but just one of the best.", "author": "Cass J."}

Thank you Yelp community!  You've helped me find some gems, the most recent being Golden Gate Bakery.  Not a tourist trap and nowhere near mediocre, some of the best Chinese pastries I've ever had!\n\nEgg Custard Tart: More than I could ever imagine!  Most egg custard I've had has been from a cart when finishing off dim sum.  Nothing can compare to these steaming masses of egg pudding in a crispy/flaking tart shell.  It is worth the wait behind the partially dirty non-velvet rope!!!\n\nSesame Ball: Lightly fried exterior with smoky toasted sesame seeds.  Loved that the chewy mochi part was very thin.  Bean filling was a little too dense for my tastes.\n\nMochi Pancake: Don't know the name of it, but it looks like a pancake made out of mochi with a bean/jam filling inside.  Was ok, but very chewy and sticky.\n\nLotus Tart: A golden hockey puck with nutty tasting lotus seed paste inside.  Great flaky exterior.  Much lighter than a moon cake.\n\nRed Bean Tart: Every bit as flaky as the lotus tart, but with a dense generous red bean paste center.  Somehow the red bean here tasted better than the bean in the sesame ball.\n\nCoconut Mochi: Freakin' amazing!!!  In the center were some hidden macadamia nuts which played so well with the coconut.  I instantly envisioned myself in a Hawaiian Chinatown near the ocean.  So tropical, so delish.\n\nMoon Cake:  A bit of a disappointment.  Most everything else blew away the competition.  This was about on par with the moon cakes from tin boxes, with a super salty yolk center.\n\nCitrus Popover: Don't know the name, but it looks like a popover and tastes like citrus, perhaps orange?  Airy like angel food.  Refreshing.\n\nMacaroon: When I first start biting into this I was like \"Crap, hard as a rock\".  I was too quick to judge.  The macaroon gave a bit and proved to be very supple on the inside.  Love the contrast of toasted coconut and soft coconut.  Might be the best coconut macaroon I've had!", "author": "Adam B."}

There's something about their flaky crust and soft eggy filling that I can't find in egg tarts from other places. I always get half a dozen, refrigerate them, then reheat them in the toaster oven when I want to eat them. (But they almost always happen to be on vacation when I am craving an egg tart, in which case an egg tart from someplace else will have to suffice.)\n\nAnother item I frequent is their char siu so - it's long and rectangular, and the pork filling is flavorful and is actually pork and not just fatty pieces! (I like non-fatty char siu. Others might find theirs too dry and not saucy enough. For this reason, I avoid their char siu baos.)\n\nI have also tried their coconut tarts - I like it, but disappointingly, it's not all coconut. The top layer is coconut, middle layer is coconut mochi (?), and it all sits inside the same flaky crust as their egg tarts. For a coconut lover, I think the coconut macaroons are a better choice than their coconut tarts.\n\nLastly, I love their mooncakes! Come mid-autumn festival season, they sell only 2 things - egg tarts and mooncakes. They make the best coconut mooncake because it's chock full of mixed nuts in between desiccated coconut! Their winter melon mooncake also incorporates nuts! I otherwise eat white or dark lotus seed paste mooncakes, and I especially like theirs because of their skin and I find it not as sweet as packaged ones.", "author": "Christina C."}

Let's start! Golden Gate Bakery (GGB) is located in the heart of the clusterf*ck we all know as Chinatown. It's kind of crazy. I've been to the Chinatown in LA, NY and SF. They're all nuts - a lot of slow moving people walking the streets. So if you're in the rush to get somewhere, get ready to move at a snail's pace while maneuvering through the human traffic. \n\nIf you're walking to GGB (I highly recommend this rather than driving there and attempting to find parking), you'll instantly notice a long ass line before approaching the store. When my girlfriend and I got there, the line was about 30 people deep which translated to a 20 minute wait. There are three things I'm not a fan of: 1) Slow internet, 2) Traffic and 3) Lines! Can you see the trend? I hate anything that requires me to wait. Yeah, I'm not the most patient guy in the world, so you can imagine how god awfully irritated I was when I was forced to wait in line because Sandy wanted to get her hands on a box load of egg custards from GGB. WHOEVER INVENTED THE LINE NEEDS TO DIE! (Chances are he/she already did.).\n\nEGG CUSTARD: Sandy got a dozen. It came in a pink box just like the ones you get at your typical donut shop. Just an FYI, she was j*zzing over these things the whole day (made me jealous). That's why we had to go. I didn't understand what all the fuss was about... until I tried one. Dude! It was actually pretty good! It literally blew me away. The make up of these egg custards spells something I would absolutely hate putting in my mouth. However, I was very pleased after my first bite. The flaky buttery crust played very well with the creamy and smooth custard. The actual custard part of it was the star - so decadent, so comforting and so good. Like the best Yelper I know (Cherylynn N.) said, the custard's texture is similar to panna cotta. She was also right about it being more milky than eggy which makes for a better eating experience. Photo cred to Cherylynn N. - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/golden-gate-bakery-san-francisco?filter_by_userid=True&select=v3wxIov6yVvs_FcQCdwc1Q&userid=eKUGKQRE-Ywi5dY55_zChg#v3wxIov6yVvs_FcQCdwc1Q\n\nThe only reason I'm not giving this place 4 stars is because even though I enjoyed the egg custard, I'm still not a fan. I personally wouldn't go back for several reasons. Mainly because the line is ridiculous and because, well, I'm still not the kind of guy who likes sinking his teeth into baked sweets.

Egg Tarts are absolute favourite treat in the world as I love all that is custard and buttery pastry.\nThus the pilgrimage began. It was a demanding journey walking through the confusing streets, resisting the seduction of all the cute shops and fresh pork buns. When we found it we almost passed it since it's hard to the see the logo, it's just a tiny thing written in small print on a window. We ended up there around 6-7, not very busy, a lot of items were picked over but there was a lot of rice pastry and it seems they keep making egg tarts throughout the day. \nThere was 2 Chinese families(you know its good when other Chinese eat it!) before us waiting for the famed egg tarts. They just pulled it out of the oven and the families almost took them all. However we managed to get about 3. \n\nEgg Tarts-  When fresh out of the oven it's very delicate. They must use whole eggs and plenty of milk instead of the rich egg yolk recipe as the custard is light and jiggly and moist. Also it's very sweet. The buttery crust was crisp/salty and not over whelming however thin so it could not stand up to the generous custard. It really plays on that perfect sweet and salty combo.\n\nCoconute rice bun filled with macadamia- This is pretty much mochi or manju but I'm not sure if there's a name for it in Chinese. This actually turned out to be my favorite. Very sweet, the rice pastry was very very soft and melted in your mouth, complimented by the delicate coconut flavor and sweet macadamia mix inside it's definitely the perfect sweet treat. Also it's very cute covered with coconut flakes and a little frosting to make it look like a bunny. A good treat to bring to a friend. \n\n I've tried ALOT of different mochi and manju and egg tarts as I live in a highly Asian populated area and these are always my go-to at the bakerys I frequent. With that in mind this is DEFINETELY a place to hit! :D\n\nPS. if you don't know your way around it's pretty deep in Chinatown and if you enter from the dragon gate then it's straight down.

I like them too and Golden Gate bakery makes the best egg tarts.\n\nHowever, I recently found a new favorite here - their cream puffs! The filling of the cream puffs are thicker and not like those weak whipped cream ones. It reminds me of home-made cream puffs I ate when I was just a little girl. \n\nThey also have delicious giant sesame balls. Crispy and yummy. The macaroons are also pretty good.\n\nSo, go out of your comfort zone and buy something other than the egg tarts from here. You might just like it.", "author": "July N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-11-10", "description": "I cannot fathom how Golden Gate Bakery makes such insanely delicious baked goods. The place looks like someone's garage storage facility, but if you're churning out such damn good Chinese pastries, I'd be happy to have you serve it out of a cardboard box on the street. \n\nThe standout item that I'm sure you're very well knowledgeable of by now is their Custard Egg Tarts. I've lived in China and I've had Custard Egg Tarts all over the place, and I can swear on everything I hold dear that Golden Gate Bakery makes the best Custard Egg Tarts I've ever had. Better than anything I've had in China, better than anything I've had in any Chinese bakery or Dim Sum restaurant in California.\n\nThe trick to Custard Egg Tarts is to not make the custard part too sweet and to make the pastry part extremely flaky. Golden Gate has mastered this art. The custard has the perfect amount of sweetness and the pastry is unbelievably flaky. And the fact that they come out piping hot is the icing on the cake. Even after days of sitting on my kitchen counter, the lukewarm custard egg tarts are still better than most egg tarts out there.\n\nI've also tried the Curry Beef Tart and the Char Siu Pork Tart, both of which are delicious. But the main event of Golden Gate is definitely their egg tarts, which completely steal the show.\n\nOne downside is that they seem to always be on vacation. There have been many times where I'd make the trek out to get a custard egg tart and I'd find out that they're closed for vacation. I guess when you're this damn good, you really can't care less if you take time off whenever you feel like it. More power to them, because no matter how many times I'm disappointed that they're randomly closed, I'll still be loyal as hell.", "author": "Roy C."}

After Dim Sum, we thought we'd check out Golden Gate Bakery to see how bad the line was. Thankfully, the line wasn't too bad - there were about 10-12 people in line ahead of us. After patiently waiting our turn, we finally made it into the store. They don't have the typical variety of pastries that you might find in a Chinatown bakery, but what they offered looked delicious. From word of mouth and past yelp reviews, the egg custard tarts are apparently the items to get. I ordered two egg custard tarts and brought them home to share with my fianc\u00e9. Despite eating them the next day, they were still pretty good - the pastry tart was nice and flaky and the egg custard was not overwhelmingly sweet. Wasn't really tempted by anything else, but they had different pastry offerings - kochi cakes, napoleons, and moon cakes. If you're in the Chinatown area, I'd recommend stopping by - if you're willing to wait in line - but I wouldn't recommend making a special trip.", "author": "Irene L."}

Two and a half hours of shopping, another hour of walking/exploring, and a strong cocktail will do that to you.\n\nI pulled out my trusty Yelp app to check up on this place I saw across the street. Lots of great reviews and a high rating and I'm in like Flynn.\n\nI really wished I had taken notice of the highlight to buy the egg custard, but went for the moon cakes instead, which I also had read somewhere were pretty good. At first it's just me and one other woman in there, but soon it's swarmed with about 10 other people in a tiny aisle and showcase of the day's baked goods. Since it took me a second to decide what I wanted, I stood back and watched what everyone else got. When it was finally turn I asked questions about the pricing of the moon cakes and one of the ladies behind the counter pointed to the paper list taped to the counter, \"Right here. It's all here.\" Now I have no idea about moon cakes, but I saw that they ranged from about $5 to $6.70 or something, each.\n\n I got a perfectly baked green tea moon cake. Not thinking it would be more than the range I've just seen from the pricing list, I go with it. The green tea cake's price was not listed. It came up to $7.70 I was so confused, but the woman was insistant, \"yah, yah it's right here\" frantically pointing to this list. I did not see the green tea moon cake listed on there, so who knows if that's what the price was. I felt so rushed! This really irked me, but since she had already put it into a bag and my mentality being of both \"Well, I'm on vacation,\" and \"I don't want to be shot dirty looks by this lady,\" I pay up. \n\nI hurried out into the street and thought to myself, \"This better be worth it...\" The outside was perfectly golden brown with a bit of a shiny glaze on the outer bread part. Inside was really dense, light green, and some sweetness. I loved its flavor and texture, but because of its denseness I knew I wouldn't be able to finish it in once sitting and it was right before dinner. The rest lasted me to the next day.\n\nKeep in mind it's CASH ONLY. Next time I've have to try the egg custard and see what the hype's all about.\n\nThanks little moon cake for holding me over before dinner.

I just want to say I've literally tried to come to golden gate bakery ever since I found out about it as a freshman at Berkeley. After 3 failed attempts.....it has finally opened AND NO LONGER ON VACATION (for the time being). Since my sister was here this weekend and an avid lover of egg tart, I called GGB to make sure they were open and we walked straight from union square after shopping.\n\nI knew the egg tart was good from so many different sources but what I ended up loving from here was their coconut macaroons. Obviously there was a line so during the line a lady in front of me suggested that if I loved coconut, I needed to try their coconut macaroons. She also warned me constantly about how impatient/hectic/busy/snappy the workers were inside since the business moves so fast and there is always a line. \n\nBasically gotta know what you wanted to order not just \"Uh...UM....Can I have..No wait..\" because they will get impatient and snappy at you! (Which i think, sadly, is the direct result of their success (due/not due to yelp haha))\n\nI ordered a dozen egg tarts and I wanted to try their coconut macaroon but I didn't want to get a whole batch, little did I know they didn't sell macaroons one by one. But I ended up convincing the worker to sell my 4 for 2 dollars. And he was right...I regret not getting 12. They were so goooood.

The reason why this place has such delicious egg tarts is because generally, the crusts are made with lard. I'm not sure if they've changed the recipe (and changed it to vegetable lard or butter), but I know for a fact in Chinese traditions, egg tarts (especially made with the delicious flake-y crust) is made with lard. Just an FYI. If I'm incorrect, please send me a message and I'll retract my opinion.\n\nLike other reviewers say, the egg tarts are amazeballs! My new favorite item is this coconut round thing with cake and cream. I am in love with it! The napoleon and the banana thing (don't know what it's called in english) is to die for! Even though everything is super expensive, I don't mind!\n\nOnly gripe I have is that they are CONSTANTLY ON VACATION! It's rather annoying...I tried calling once before heading over for my lunch and the phone line was busy. I thought...oh..ok...it's busy that means someone's there. NOPE! It was friggin closed! Ugh!\n\n****TIP****\nAs with any place with a lot of hype, best time to go is the down time. I usually like to go around after lunch....so around 1 on a weekday.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-05-17", "description": "After two tries when the bakery was closed for vacation, I finally got my grubby  little hands on these famous egg tarts. Six to be precise. And a custard-filled pineapple bun. The tarts were served warm and I immediately tasted one as soon as I stepped outside. (And then ate another one after I was done.)  \n\nYes, they may actually be the best ones I've had. Definitely at least one of the best. BUT--are they FAR better than other egg tarts? Nah. First off, I've rarely had a bad tart as it's a basic staple of dim sum and Chinese bakeries that tastes pretty similar (delicious) everywhere. Main differences are whether it's a \"cookie\" or flaky crust (Golden Gate's is flaky, which I prefer) and how firm, yellow, and eggy-tasting the egg part is. Depending on your preferences, Golden Gate's may not even be your favorite.  \n\nGolden Gate's filling is actually not that eggy/yolky tasting given how hefty the egg part is. The filling is pale yellow and has a very fluffy, loose texture and light sweetness to it. Very very good. The taste is comparable to other great egg tarts I've tried, but it is unusual for the large amount of custard and the slightly lighter color and texture.  \n\nBottom line: Trek here if you are within a couple of blocks or you're an egg tart afficionado. But no regrets if you skip it in favor of one of the many bakeries and dim sum places in Chinatown. I would definitely go back to Golden Gate, but wouldn't wait more than five minutes for tarts.\n\nNote to DC-area folks: The egg tarts at Oriental East in Silver Spring--at least the Portugusese-style/burnt ones--are similar: tall, light, loose, fluffy custard with flaky crust.", "author": "Chesty L."}

I decided to throw hunger to the wind and use my time wisely--a shopping spree for fall was certainly in order in my books.  \n\nYes, that's right folks, my sole intention was to shop, I didn't care if my only meal that day consisted of a greasy slice of pizza eaten in haste on my way to Ross and Macy's.  I had made up my mind--I was going to shop and the foodie side of me was going to be compromised.  \nWhen I set out at 9am to the hotel lobby, the concierge told me stores dont open till 10. There goes my master plan.\n\nThen I remembered that Marc D had suggested going to Golden Gate Bakery and eating their egg tarts.  There wasn't any free wifi to be had anywhere I looked, but thank god for the dinky map I ripped out of the San Fran Where mag and my photographic memory of his message, (I remember seeing \"Grant\") I made my trek out for the grail of tarts. \n\nThe Tart\n\n*I cannot believe I'm standing in line for an egg tart*\nThe line up outside the door was insane.  Sure it was Autumn Moon Festival but the people in line were there for the Egg Tarts, not the moon cakes.  The bakers downstairs could not make them fast enough.  As soon as one tray came up, it was taken away by one customer who had ordered 2 or 3 dozen of the things.   Sheesh,  should I abandon my post and go to the mall? \n\nI waited.  and waited.  and waited.  The lady in front of me said she waited an hour last week and to counter that instead of getting the one dozen she came for, she got 3 dozen to pay for the long wait. \n\nFinally it was my turn.  I ordered 4 egg tarts and 2 moon cakes (one lotus seed and one red bean-NO YOLKS!)  The tarts were place in a white paper bag piping hot and not sealed to let out the steam.\n\nAt 1.19USD a pop they are not cheap, but man, are they delicious!\nThe crust is thin yet flaky like those crisco commercials with the fork flaking at the pie crusts. The custard was still warm and very sweet.  There was a thin layer of clear sugary liquid that seeped out of the custard while baking and was resting on top of the jiggly tart goodness.  The ratio of crust to custard was perfect. \n\nEpilogue: \n\nI had already devoured 2 of the Egg tarts by the time I was barely 2 blocks away from the bakery.  In my defense, it was already 10am and I needed to speedy gonzalez it to the stores before I was back on the plane in a few hours. \n\nNext time I'm there I'll make it a point to get at least 1 dozen of them!\n\nPS:  the moon cakes were good too, but pricey!\nPPS: if any of you know how to tag yelpers in reviews, please fill me in!", "author": "Yoony P."}

I love the flaky, buttery crust and the sweet, soft custard-like center! I've been lucky to have eaten those fresh out of the oven but be careful as they can burn your mouth.\n\nThey are not small egg tarts either and make for a hearty dessert after some to-go dim sum!

CHINATOWN! Meeting up with a local friend of mine first, we make our way to Chinatown. After a quick walk around I spotted another bakery showing some custard cups in the window, and that strike up my appetite; however, I was denied. \"This place is okay, but I take you to another one around the corner, Golden Gate, we might have to wait, but it's good.\"\n\nLet me tell you one thing, if Chinese people are willing to stand in line for something, chances are, that something is great and totally worth the time, because we are some very impatient people LOL! So we came to Golden Gate Bakery. Best. Egg. Custard. Around. No joke. My first recognized favorite food at three years old was egg custard. The custard did not taste watered down unlike other places, where they skim on the filling by adding more water into the custard batter. \n\nBut Golden Gate Bakery is not all about egg custard cups. Their Po Lou Bao (similar to Japanese Melon Bun, or Mexican Conchas) tasted so good fresh out of oven; the crust was buttery and sweet and crispy, and the bun sweet and soft in the middle. Other traditional pastry items like BBQ rolls, butter cream bun, and \"thousand egg\" cake are all very good.\n\nAlso since it's now around the season of Moon Festival, it's the prime time for freshly baked moon cakes. I got more than just a few, and willing to haul it all the way back to the East Coast to give them out to the family there.", "author": "Kuanyu C."}

It'll probably take around 30-40 minutes to wait to get your stuff. Which is why I knocked it down a star for the wait. It isn't THAT bad, but for getting a pastry that fits in your palm, most of the time people order boxes which leads to a longer wait sometimes.

I am of course referring to the famous Egg Custard Tart of Golden Gate Bakery that everyone and their mother goes absolutely bonkers for. Well, most of us who live in the Bay Area anyway. Well, most of us who are Asian in the Bay Area...I mean, chances are, if you're reading this review on Golden Gate Bakery, you're not from 'round these parts...and if you are, you're living under a solid mass of granite 'round these parts. Not to say you should feel bad for not having ever heard of Golden Gate Bakery, I myself have only heard about it from my beautiful girlfriend just about a year ago...but I'm from Arizona, so I get to play that card, which is a nice card to play. Though if you really have not heard of Golden Gate Bakery and want to try it awesome contents, BE FOREWARNED: They are notorious for closing their doors randomly for extended periods of time. So much so that there is a group on the 'Book called: Is Golden Gate Bakery Open Today? (and yes I do follow that group) that lets you know if the bakery is open on any particular day. Anyways, on to the more productive less-ADHD part of the review:\n\nGolden Gate Bakery is vastly well known for their Egg Custard Tarts, as you can probably tell from the other reviews on the GGB (pardon the Bay Area-esque acronymization). Their Tarts are very famous because they are (imho) not too sweet, yet not in the least bit bland, and the pastry part of the tart is very soft, yet flaky at the same time. The custard portion of the tart has the consistency of freshly mixed homemade pudding, and believe it not (Ripley eat your heart out) still holds the same consistency after being refrigerated over night. The tarts are best when fresh, which means you (ctrl+i)* should  (crtl+i)* eat them right after you walk out of GGB, but you can toast them the next day or even 2 days after purchasing. I am unsure if they are able to keep longer under refrigeration, as I have only kept them at most 2 days after the initial purchase...and believe me, 2 days means I know how to show Buddhist-like restraint. I recommend preheating your toaster oven at about 350, then throwing no more than 2 custards in the oven for about 2-3 minutes, in my past experience that worked super well, remember to throw in  sheet of foil under the custards. The custard are tastiest when warm, though just last evening my better half and I did the unthinkable and ate the  tart cold, and man...it was still wicked amazing.\n\nThe custards are not the only amazing thing that GGB offers, and you should feel ashamed for even thinking that...tsk tsk...obligatory 3rd tsk. We also tried GGB's beef curry pastry, chicken curry pastry, and their Wife Cakes (haha...wife cake...). GGB's curry meat pastries are super tasty, though be cautious, if you eat them fresh from the bakery they are freaking HOT, I mean they contain curry (which is part liquid) which can be molten hot magma (admit it...you read that in Dr. Evil's voice...didn't you) in your mouth. Imagine biting into a Hot Pocket the second you remove it from ye olde nuker...instantaneous 3rd degree roof-of-mouth burns. The pastries can come off as a bit salty, but I still find them delicious and very addicting. The wife cake was ok as well, though I feel that it left more to be desired. \n\nPlease note that since the egg custard tarts are the fan favorite, there are times that GGB does not make enough (if at all) of the other offerings to facilitate the necessary baking of the tarts. I gave GGB 4 stars, not because of the quality of the food, but because of it's typical Chinatown service: get them in, get their payment, get them out. Being a kid of the 'burbs, I can't bring myself to rock 5 stars to any place with anything short of impeccable service.\n\nAll in all, the GGB is a great place to grab a not-so-quick pastry (typical wait-line is about 10-25 minutes), and if you're ever wondering about the hype, it is most surely worth the drive and wait. 10/10 would continue to eat their deliciousness again.\n\n* I know that physically typing the command for italics doesn't make my font appear in italics...but admit it...you liked it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTLDR? ;)", "author": "Julian N."}

I did not like the fact how the bottom was so soft and was literally falling all over the place. It was good, though I think the profound smell and taste of the egg was a little too overwhelming. The crust was buttery, flaky and soft which is a plus, though it seemed slightly under cooked to me as well as to my friend.\n\nIt was very inexpensive; I believe $2.25 for 2 tarts certainly not bad.\n\nI don't know, maybe I just am not used to it that fresh, or maybe mine just happened to be  slightly under cooked.

But..\n\nIt's worth it!\n\nI've never had daan tat (egg tarts) anywhere in the US that tasted as good as these.  The egg filling isn't too custardy/sweet/eggy, and I was surprised by how light it was.  The crust was a perfect thin flakyness, none of the cheap mini-pie crust crap.  My fingers weren't oily after touching them either, always a plus in my book.  I didn't feel weighed down after eating one (dangerous b/c you can scarf down multiples) and went to dinner in a great mood.\n\nI originally planned on getting just 1 as a dinner pre-game, but added on more with each five minute block i had to wait in line.  Ended up getting a dozen, which were half gone by the next morning.  Very common to see local chinese ppl buying these in bulk (2, 3, 4 dozen).  \n\nWait in line!

Two minutes later, my Chinese mother, White father (oh yes, you don't have to have an Asian palate to enjoy an egg tart - if you like custard and warm, flaky pie crusts, then you will thoroughly enjoy the tart),  and two sisters were all oohing and ahhing over the warm, flaky goodness of the tarts.  And 2 days later, when they were no longer in San Francisco, they were still talking about it.\n\nWe sampled other deserts there too which were also very good but the egg tart is by far, their specialty.\n\n(IF FOLLOWING MY \"CHINATOWN FOODIE TOUR, get one egg custard tart per person.  You can also try other items if interested.)", "author": "Linda H."}

So we got in line and wait, and waited... and waited (we had some tourist couple ask us what we were standing in line for too). After about 30 minutes, we finally made it inside and ordered 6 egg tarts, a mooncake, and some muffin thing. Tarts were $1.65 each when I stopped by which sounds like they've gone up in price quite a bit. \n\nHowever, I'm happy to say my first ever egg tart and moon cake experience was not disappointing. The tart crusts were crispy around the top and sides, a little soft at the bottom. The filling not too sweet. Mmmm. The moon cake was delicious as well, but I wasn't a huge fan of the yolk in the middle (a little too dry and salty for my liking). I'm not sure what the muffin was exactly, but it was buttery and fluffy.\n\nOverall a good experience, but I have nothing else to really compare it to.", "author": "Miffy Y."}

However, I felt like I came during the worst season. Next week is the Asian \"mid autumn festival\" and EVERYONE  was FIGHTING.....FIGHTING to buy mooncakes. All that I want was just some egg tarts..but had to get in a very long line. A line that wrapped around the block. Yes..WRAPPED around the block. lol. \n\nI waited for a good 45 minutes. I talked to some grandpa/grandma while waiting and they indeed agree that these were the best in town. After the long anticipation...it felt like a golden moment when I finally got the opportunity to buy my egg tarts. I blew $50 with 6 tarts & 4 mooncake. I would say rather expensive but ppl were buying bulks and busting out alteast 2-3 benjamins. I heard some grandpa pleading to buy more but they were limiting. Talking about profit? Especially during these economic conditions. \n\nAbout my egg tart. The crust was very flaky and baked to perfection. It did have a golden touch. However, rather greasy. The egg custard itself was a light yellow color, warm and wasn't too sweet. Overall, I would say that they did taste different because you can actually taste \"the egg\" in the tart and not just food coloring with a mix of half egg and some kind of filler. A method rather typical for most dim sum places. The main difference would be that they use lard instead of vegetable oil? You can taste the greasy goodness. \n\nI would totally come here for egg tarts whenever I visit but it's not something that I'll crave and go head over heels about. They're different and pretty good but most dim sum seafood restaurant in LA will make the cut for our egg tart cravings. They're $1.15 a piece or $13.88/dz. NO DISCOUNTS. sighs.\n\nWell..since I was at it..I gave the mooncake a shot too. Bought one that was \"five nuts\" and the other 3 were coconut since moms' favorite was coconut. These mooncake run around $8-9 a piece. I have to say that the \"five nuts\" was surprisingly good. The crust/skin wasn't all too amazing since it was rather dry and didn't have too much grease. however the filling itself was awesome. It had a load of macadamia nuts, pumpkin seeds, sweet wintermelon, shreds of chinese preserved meat, almond, salty egg yolk and some other nuts which I cannot recall. It was the generous portion of macadami and almond that really blew me away. Those of you who has tried the typical \"five nuts\" should know that mooncakes from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan never includes macadamia or almond. Macadamia is one of the priciest nuts and is definitely a US local. \n\nThis place is insanely shabby and has only 2 tiny tables and like 4 chairs at max. Oh..I also grabbed a macaroon (chinese style) and it was ehh..nothing amazing.\n\nService was rather bad as the ladies work at a nonstop rate. Don't bother questioning of asking what they'd recommend. You'll most likely end up with a dirty look. Don't ask me why. lol. Can only be dumb once in a scenario like this.\n\n\n\n\nCrying in pain in my heart*", "author": "Susan T."}

All of this divine goodness is wrapped with their buttery, crispy and flaky crust. Moreover, the filling-to-crust ratio is just right. And somehow coming in a pink cardboard box just makes them a little more legit.\n\nTrust no other bakery's egg tarts in the Bay Area.

In all the years I ate here, I have never been disappointed with the egg tart being too eggy, too sweet, too anything. It is just perfect.\n\nOnce a year the golden gate bakery does make moon cakes for the moon cake festival. I have lined up super early in the morning before they open for hours to buy moon cake.

I was staying at the Hilton that night, and wanted to treat her to dinner for being my taxi.  We wandered around Chinatown, not really having any plans.  Ate at Kay Cheung and found ourselves here at Golden Gate Bakery afterwards.  There was a short line that was not moving at all, but we discovered that people were waiting for the next batch of egg custards to come out of the oven.\n\nWith nothing better to do, we decided to wait, too.  Hubby's a fan of egg custards, so I bought one for him and a sponge cake for me.  Later in the evening while sitting at my desk in the hotel room, Q calls and tells me I must eat the egg custard.\n\n\"No,\" I tell her, \"it's for hubby.  I don't really care for them myself.\"\n\n\"No,\" she tells me, \"you must try it.  I haven't even driven out of the City yet and I can't believe how good these are.  You have to eat it while it's warm.\"\n\nWell, alright, I will take a bite to please my sweet friend.  Wow!  This is really good.  Wow, it disappeared like magic; nothing left for hubby.

Just a sweet crust on top that reminds one of it's lumpy texture. \n\n\"faht gok bao\" Bun of France. Fluffy chewy yellow bread with sweet crust on top. Weekends only. Only the French can beat this one. \n\nCoconut filled bun \"Gai Mei Bao\". Coconut flakes and filling inside. Soft and chewy.\n\nThose are my favorites. \n\nNotables: mooncakes. This is why they are really famous in certain circles of the Chinese community. Their mooncakes are made fresh on the premises. To the Chinese, that was a godsend since imports were the norm at the time - read: stale/old from Hong Kong, Taiwan or China.\n\nTheir mooncake recipe has only improved since I first had them. They now even come in half-sizes which are more manageable but just as delicious. If you like nutty get the \"Mm Yun\". \"Bak Leen Yong Dan Wong\" is Lotus Paste with Egg Yolk - that's the original and really yummy.\n\nBeware though mooncakes are pretty heavy and fattening.

Who doesn't like the smell of baked goods?\n\nThe place is cramped, practically bursting at the seams with baking supplies (probably bought in bulk because it's a better value.. you know how us Asians are), but in a cute charming way. The older ladies manning the counter only add to this charm.\n\nWhen I got my egg tart, it came straight out of the warmer/oven/thing and was warm and fragrant. As soon as I was outside the shop, I snapped a quick picture and bit in.\n\nAnd I didn't like it as much as I wanted to. Previous reviews have called the tarts greasy. Yep, definitely greasy. It's also not a well-executed custard, technically. The top of the custard filling was smooth and creamy, but the bottom was cooked at too high a temperature and the egg curdled, which gives it that very strong egg-y taste. Or maybe it was cooked perfectly but got too hot in the warming oven, so it curdled there. Either way, it was overcooked and didn't taste right as a result.\n\nI was really sad because I so wanted to like these egg tarts, but alas, it wasn't meant to be.\n\nBut, it is somewhat of a landmark so still worth a trip.

And I work close by, so if the line is prohibitively long, I know that I can always come back another day.\n\nTrue, it is sad to want for delicious Chinese baked goods, and leave without.  But I do.  And no other bakery will scratch the itch.  Here is why:\n\nEgg Custards.\nI have these so often now, I have a point scale.  Occasionally my egg custard is a 10.  Generally it's between an 8 and a 9.  On bad days, it will be a 6 or a 7.  Every other egg custard I have had from other bakeries tops off at a 4.\n\nWhen they are at the top of their games the custards are,\nHOT - straight out of the oven, into my mouth, scalding as I eat the first one on the sidewalk\nFLAKY - with an outer crust that bursts into a million pieces as you take the first bite (there is no way to share one of these)\nCRISPY - a bottom crust that is burnished, and provides structure for the tart, and some resistance for the teeth\nUNBROKEN - cooked to the point of just setting, before the egg-protein bonds become too tight and scramble the custard inside (which is almost impossible to do without a water bath)\n\nEven when they are not hot, they are at worst warm.  And I love how they are less sweet than their counterparts at other bakeries.  Plus, the custard has a nice natural eggy color, and is not shockingly yellow, which is appealing.\n\n\nBut egg custards is just one of the many delicious sweet and savory treats you can experience at golden gate.\n\nMy other favorites:\nPineapple Bun: So soft.  So warm.  So comforting.  With a crunchy top.  Just had one today.\nCocktail Bun: Rich and sweet.  With filling and icing.  And warm.  And soft.\nMacaroons: So crispy.  Amazingly crispy.  Did you fry these? They are so good.  \nCoconut Tart: Like the egg tart, but with a mound of rich chewy coconut.  Think of it like a cookie in a pie shell.\nBaked Pork Buns: Tender, non-grizzly pork, in a salty 5-spice sauce, surrounded by rich sweet dough.  Melts in the mouth.  And it's meat.\nThose Sponge Cake Cupcakes: but only if they are hot.  But if they are hot... watch-out.  Kind of like a popover, but lightly sweet.\n\nThere are more.  But part of the fun is in the discovery.  \n\nSo go early, skip the line, and consider it a late breakfast.  OR eat dessert before lunch.  Now that we are grown ups, we can do that sort of thing.", "author": "Daniel B."}

It is much larger than the egg tarts you'd find at Dim Sum restaurants and the custard here is way better.  Though that doesn't say too much because egg tarts at restaurants are not usually good.... the Golden Gate's custard is too soft for me...almost like the consistency of very soft tofu.\n\nI personally love a shortbread crust but I can also appreciate Golden Gate's ability to make a great flaky crust.  If you were to hand me an egg tart from JJ Bakery and one from Golden Gate...I'd pick JJ's every time.  I'd come here again to get these egg tarts for other people because they are good, just not for me.\n\nThe chocolate cake roll and chicken pie were good but I've had better at other Asian bakeries.  This is the first time I've seen those Asian rice krispies sold fresh!  I do not like raisin and they made ones without them :D  These were chewier, sticker, and oilier  than the packaged ones I've had.

I love this place, and I always try to come out here when I'm in SF, even if I'm on the other side of the city, because it's just that good.  I always get one to eat right in the store, and get another dozen to bring home.  They're amazing when they're still warm, but still very good after they cool down.  The egg custard part is very light and not too sweet.  For me, they have the perfect custard to tart ratio, where there is a ton of custard in a thin flaky tart crust.  I hate places that have really thick shortbread type of crust with a little bit of custard.  The downside is that parking is horrible in the area, and the bakery will close randomly. They must have really good business, because I've had a few times when I get there and they're closed.  Now I always call before I head over to make sure they're open.", "author": "Jenny H."}

Almost everyone I know living in the Bay Area know of this golden gate bakery and their egg tart and often say how awesome their egg tarts are. But to me....... Over the years it's quality is going down. The biscuit portion is supposed to be between soft and crispy but over the years it's getting softer and softer.... To a point that the egg almost float out (okay a bit exaggeration here but you get what I mean) and the egg, yea it's hot it has a strong egg smell but it is a bit on the watery side. Is it their signature way to make egg tart? I'm not sure, it's just way too soft. Yet the lines are getting longer and longer over the years, which I don't feel it is justified. And sometimes you crave for it you go there and the shop is closed..... I'm quite sure the owner has really earned enough that they don't have to open their shop everyday even on the weekend, but this kind of disappointment plus the downgrading quality just does not attract me to come anymore....

The egg custard tart is this bakery's raison d'etre, and that's what let me down.  I noted that it was slightly over-baked (no big deal), but the separation of the 96 layers just isn't there!  The tart shell is meant to be a work of art, the testing stone of a Chinese pastry chef.  I was so intrigued by this art-form that I once tried it myself (as in \"making it\").  The way it works: you have the water dough and the oil dough (made from lard if done properly, but don't let me gross you out); you layer it one upon the other - first 2 layers, rolling pin, followed by folding the layered dough (4 layers), rolling it again, folding ... Legend has it that the egg tart shell has 96 layers, but an amateur math student will tell you that it's gotta be 64 or 128.  No matter.  The one I made (YEARS ago) separated like a blossoming yellow rose.  This baby at Golden Gate?  Not so much.  I wolfed that baby down.  The custard tasted fine, but let's face it, egg custard tart is MUCH more about the shell than the custard.  We also tried the glutinous rice ball with peanut filling (you could also have lotus seed and red bean): good texture, but unusual banana-cake flavoring.

It's not so much the egg custard that's worth mentioning but the tart! It is so flaky! While a lot of the common eggtarts are solid and more like solid cookie crust than flaky- Golden Gate Bakery's eggtarts are genuinely fluffy and flaky- you can see each layer of the tart. It's what Canto people call, \"so pei dan tat\" as in flaky egg tart. Egg tarts are supposed to be flaky and fluffy and Golden Gate is one of those rare places where they do this. Takes skills. \n\nTheir eggtarts ARE a bit on the expensive side at $1.25 each, they are a bit bigger than the average egg tart so I'd say it's worth it. At least worth it for you to try. \n\nAside from their eggtarts, I really like their baked BBQ buns and banana roll. Those have pretty good prices and are super good too.\n\nThere's almost always a long, long, long line in front of Golden Gate Bakery the wait in line can rate from 2 minutes to 30 minutes. But, seriously, as a regular customer, even if there's a line, even if they're a bit expensive, and even if whatever whatever whatever you SHOULD give it a try because just the fact that they're open that day is a miracle!

Every time I found myself in close proximity to Golden Gate Bakery, there was a line.  So I grumbled, and I walked on.  Until one day, the line wasn't quite so bad and I resolved to go inside and see what the fuss was about.\n\nIn typical Chinese bakery style, there are tons of yummy delights crammed into every nook of a very small space.  Being fairly new to the world of Chinese bakeries, there were many things that looked delectable but unfamiliar.  I expected someplace so crowded and popular to be very no-nonsense: get in, order, get out.  But the women behind the counter were so incredibly helpful!  They told us what everything was, they made recommendations, they smiled, talked, laughed, and generally made us feel welcome.  I was expecting good food.  Good service?  Not so much.  To get such excellent service?  I must say that it really floored me.\n\nSo long story short, we bought a lot of food.  We bought rice cake and moon cake and egg custard tart and wife cake and dumplings and something awesome stuffed with winter melon.  Though I'm no expert, I found it all to be really freakin' tasty.  The rice cakes were chewy, the dumplings were crunchy, the pastry was flaky, and the melon/lotus fillings were sweet and nutty and creamy and crystally in the way of things that probably contain a goodly amount of sugar.  The egg custard tart was definitely the most impressive thing we had to eat, and what really struck me was how brilliantly light the filling was.  It just tasted like egg, slightly sweetened.  I've never really had a dessert before that just felt so pure.\n\nI don't know if I'll always find myself wanting to brave the line to get my hands on Golden Gate Bakery's baked goods, and I'm not even educated enough in Chinese pastries to tell you that it's really a head above the rest.

When you pass by it, it's just a small store with a LONG line. The line probably goes around the store because the space is so small. I had to wait a good 40 minutes to get to the front. There weren't a whole mess of people but I think the reason why the line was so slow was because the service was so inefficient. The ladies who work in the front only know how to speak chinese so it's hard for non-chinese speakers to communicate. Not everything on the menu is available in the store so don't expect to get everything you want.\n\nI originally wanted 2 egg tarts and one pineapple moon cake. Confused on how to order, one lady pointed at me to order and when I hesitated for a few seconds, she straight up ignored me and moved on to the next customer..rude much? Also, since I ordered in english, I think she thought I said 3 egg tarts and a moon cake, so I had no choice than to get one more. I think the baked goods are only good when it's warm and straight off the oven. The egg tarts were impressive. The tart wasn't overwhelmingly crunchy, but had just enough crunch and flake. The egg custard was soft, sweet, and yummy. I can't really say much for the moon cake except that it's how I imagined a regular red bean bread would be except a bit crunchier.

Me and my brother followed my mom for what seemed like hours, trekking up and down the hills of Chinatown as she scoured for fruits, veggies, and misc groceries. We waited patiently, toting those pink and white plastic baggies as she shopped. I hated fighting the crowds of anxious shoppers hunting for the cheapest greens and fruits,  the workers shouting out their deals, while the tourists taking in all the smells, sights, and noises moseying along.. where everyday seemed to be a never-ending parade. \n\nThe one highlight was stopping by Golden Gate bakery for an afternoon snack before the ride home. There was no line or craziness like there is now. You could just walk in, order, take a seat, and enjoy their infamous dan tat.\n\n3 reasons why this is the best dan tat: \n1. EGGY CUSTARD goodness with just enough wiggle and jiggle in its custard. \n2. The right tint of YELLOW-just how an egg custard should look, you know? Not those bootleg ones that look orange. \n3. All wrapped inside a FLAKY, crispy, crunchy tart. The messy kind of crust that leaves a mess of crumbs all over your lips and mouth, clothes, and car (if you can wait that long). That's the kind of messy I like. \n\nAll in all, a perfect little tart. \nAnd every tart is served warm, which adds to just how delectable this tart is. YOU NEED TO EAT IT WARM.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-01-25", "description": "One of the best dantat (egg tart) I've had. A lot of other places usually get the balance wrong, either, too much crust or too much egg. This one gets the balance just right. Also, it isn't heavy or greasy at all. Most of the time when I eat a dantat it feels like I just ate a donut.\n\nThe best part of Golden Gate's dantat would have to be the crust. It's flakey and has an awesome flavor. The egg custard isn't overly sweet either. The only downside is that it's a little pricey at $1.15 each. But when you're one of the best I guess you can charge that much.\n\nI tried another custard filled pastry here too. It had the same quality as the dantat. Soft, airy, and not overly sweet. I didn't have any greasy stomach pains afterward.", "author": "Michael H."}

She RUNS into this bakery and I'm sitting there with the car running, pretty confused.\n\nShe comes back and says that this is THE BEST bakery in all of Chinatown, if not in San Francisco.

I don't even like egg that much.\n\nI took a bite of the pork bun. YUM. Just as I expected. It was insanely good. A yummy buttery bun with pork inside. How do they do that?? I guess it's better not to ask, and just eat. Next was the egg tart. Boy was I wrong to judge that little treat. It was AMAZING. Like sweet custard pie. Not too sweet. Not really that much of an egg flavor, and the texture was just so creamy.\n\nAfter doing a bit of research on this place, it's apparent that they are KNOWN for their egg tarts.

With that said, unless you are already in the area for something else and can swing by, I would call them to see if they are open before making the trek out there. \n\nAdditionally, it is possible that you may get yelled at by one of the old ladies, both there and on the phone.  The problem is their egg custards are bomb....and they know it- so combine that with an old chinese lady and it becomes lethal.\n\nSo I take the yelling, random store closures, and long lines because the egg custards (dan tat) really is THAT good.  When it is fresh out of the oven, it is extra yummy- nice and warm.  They crust is flakey and crunchy and the egg is soft, non greasy, with the perfect hint of sweetness. Mmm mmm.  I also tried the coconut custard, coconut mochi like pastry with peanut butter filling, and white cake with lemon spread- all very good.  The coconut tart has similar crust to the egg tart but with toasty coconut filling.\n\nThis deliciousness comes at a steep price.  The egg tarts are $13 for a dozen or $1.15 each, which is pretty steep as you can get them for $.60 at other pastries, but of course they aren't as good.

It helps that the bakery is always so busy so the egg tarts comes out hot and fresh each time.  Maybe thats why their egg tarts are so good.  I had to wait 20-30 mins each time I come here.  \n\nI was surprised that the customer service was really good, even though I am not Chinese.  Maybe looking Chinese helps?  I was buying a lot of egg tarts (a dozen for my family and like 6 or 7 more for my friends) and a bunch of other goodies.  The lady helping me was very patient and didn't rush us.  My sister and I have eyes bigger than our stomach and just pointed to anything that looks good.  I forgot to tell the lady to separate them into 2 boxes for me, my fault.  So I asked for her to give me another box so I can do it myself later since they were TOO busy.  She didn't understand what I was saying and I had to explain to her for like 1-2 mins and she INSISTED on separating the egg tarts and putting them into two separate boxes for me when I insisted on doing it myself cause they were too busy.

This place really reminded me of a Sprinkles Cupcakes except that Beverly Hills is replaced by Chinatown. The reason for this comparison is that they are both very good but may get an undeserved amount of business based on their hype and reputation. It seemed like half the tourists jumped in line thinking that this place must be something special since its the only line in chinatown. I honestly feel bad for most of the tourists cause none of the tourists that jumped behind me ordered any egg tarts.The restaurant really should just rename themselves Golden Gate Tarts.   \n\nI ordered a dozen of their signature egg tarts and they did not disappoint. I brought them back to the westfield mall and ate them with a liter of milk from Bristol Farms and they were the perfect combination. I really liked how they were huge and flaky without being too sweet.  These were by far the best egg tarts I have ever had, though my dad thought they were simply average.\n\nI also tried their pork bun, coconut tart, and my favorite, the cocktail bun. The cocktail bun was disappointing. The bread was just so soft and there was barely any filling. The pork buns were average and the coconut tarts were almost as good as the egg tarts. I'll stick to nothing but tarts next time. I'll be back again just cause its so close to BART and Union Square.", "author": "Tim T."}

It's sweet and best eaten when you get it fresh. It's warm and gooey with a pleasant sweetness that will bring a smile to your face. It's a little pricier than other places in the area, but this is what you pay for quality.\n\nATMOSPHERE: People in line are usually friendly and just trying to get something sweet for their pallets just like you. The staff isn't very personal, but they're quick. The place is pretty small and there is only street parking close by with the exception of paid parking, but it's in SF Chinatown and that's to be expected of the area. Prepare accordingly.\n\nWHY FOUR? There is always a line. This place is always busy and sometimes the staff can seem a little rushed because of how hectic it can get. Be patient, order your dozen or so \"dan tat\" and enjoy them. Don't worry too much about the wait, they're pretty quick.\n\nCONCLUSION: I love sweet things and this place is a must if I'm even remotely nearby.\n\n-TanK", "author": "Kevin T."}

With that said, the egg custard tarts here definitely aren't bad but I'd rather save 35 cents and buy them from somewhere else.  Compared to other places, they seem bigger and contain more of the egg custard filling.  But I'm still hesitant to buy it for $1.15 each.  (That's partly due to the fact that one daan tat disappears into my stomach after about 30 seconds for me.  Hmm, is $1.15 equal to 30 seconds of joy??  Maybe.)\n\nWhat I definitely wouldn't pay for again are their mochi items that they offer.  I ordered the ones with red bean as the filling.  Sure, they're larger than usual, but there's hardly any filling.  It's predominantly mochi.  And how much did I pay for them?  $1.35 each.  A bit overpriced, don't you think?  I can get 5 mini buns for $1.50 at another bakery in Chinatown, which would satisfy me a lot more!!  If it wasn't because I had a craving for them, I would not have gotten them.  What I do have to commend them on is the banana flavor that seems to be infused into the mochi parts.  \n\nThe last few times that I've come to golden gate bakery, there have been no lines whatsoever, despite what many seem to experience.  Maybe that's what makes the daan tats good.", "author": "Vanessa C."}

It's a small place in the middle of Chinatown...and the longest i've ever seen the line was out their door to the next stand's door...but they're also good at moving people in and out courteously. \n\nThe Dan Taat's used to be a dollar, but now they're a bit more each...but ah, what can you do? Their the best and the economy sucks. This place is so popular and does so well that they can even have the luxury of taking a few weeks off for vacation a year (i found this out when i went there once and they were closed to my surprise...but good for them! they deserve it!).", "author": "N C."}

I've heard so much about the egg tarts at this place so when I came here about a month ago I was horribly disappointed when I found out they were on vacation for a month! You know a place is good when they get so much damn business that they can just close up shop without warning and leave a paper sign on the door saying they are gone on vacation. \n     When I came here last weekend, the weekend before Chinese New Year, it was packed. The streets were crowded and the store was too! Surprisingly we were able to get our order in about 40 minutes. I thought we'd be waiting for well over an hour but the line moved at a decent speed! \n     After the long wait I definitely ordered a lot of things. What a great business cycle for them huh? Have a huge line that people will wait in, and then because they waited so long they buy a bunch of stuff to make the wait worth it!\n     Anyways my first time here I of course ordered egg tarts, 15 to be precise. Not all for myself! I also tried banana mochi, sweet rice cake, coconut tart, some yellow bread thingie, and a pancake thingie. \n     The egg tarts are definitely the best thing there and the only reason you should make a trip to this bakery. I ordered the regular flavor and they are hot and yummy and not to sweet on the inside and the crush is nice and flakey on the outside. Unfortunately when you bring it home and try to re-heat it yourself it is not as good, tasty still but not as good. Definitely the moment you step out of that mess grab one out of your bag and chomp away. Don't burn yourself though! \n    Everything else was eh. It was good but I definitely wouldn't go here specifically for those items. I have other chinese bakeries that are closer to my house, cheaper, and less crowded that do a better job with the other types of bakery. But purely for the egg tarts I would come back.", "author": "Gabby N."}

Eat it when it's hot cuz that's when it's really delicious. And remember to call ahead in case they're closed and on vacation.  But don't call them too much or they'll get annoyed at you.\n\nAnd don't get the coconut red bean mochi.  The sponge cake is ok to get.", "author": "Minako S."}

So far I've only tried their almond cookies and egg tarts, and both are really good. The almond cookies come in bags of 6 for $2.40, while the egg tarts are sold individually for $1.15. Both prices are pretty reasonable for how good they taste. Be sure you have the egg tart when it's still warm. The soft center and perfectly crispy outer shell separate their egg tarts from everyone else's!\n\nThe only gripe I have is that this place takes looong, extended vacations after the mid-autumn festival every year.

In fact, I've become an instant fan of GGB! These are definitely one of *thee* best, if not already the best, egg tarts I've had outside HK. \n\nThe crust is fluffy and flakey. The custard is not only sweet but you can actually taste the egg flavor.  Not too sweet and not too eggy, altogether baked into perfection. The aroma, the taste - pure bliss! Just be careful how you handle them cause they are oh-so delicate.\n\nI may not be a particular fan of the larger sized egg tarts and while I much prefer eating the mini ones you get at dimsum restaurants (where the more neon-toxic-yellow the custard looks, the better it tastes), Golden Gate Bakery has made an exception for me. \n\nSo why the 4 stars?

With a box of tarts in hand, I find a quiet spot on Grant Ave to enjoy my sweet treats. Hot creamy custard cradled by warm flaky crust is a flavor explosion. Wonderful mouth feel. Custard is delicate like flan, not rich as creme brulee. No greasy feeling in mouth from the flaky crust. Best eaten fresh and warm. Not nearly as wonderful cold, next day or microwaved.

There will be a line outside the store. The store square footage is really small, I mean is tiny. Is a one way in and one way out situation. Get in line.\n\n2. You will have to wait because the egg costars are being made as you wait and they come out of the oven in batches and they are super fresh, piping hot and the smell of buttery pastry and sweet eggs mixture are intoxicating. \n\n3. Be prepared to place your order when you get inside. These people don't mess around and they move at the speed of light. You'llneed to know exactly how many pieces of egg custard tarts you want so they know what size boxes to bring out. They do not like it if you tell them 6 and then change your order to 12. When in doubt, get more. You'll thank later. \n\n4. Have cash on hand. You are in China Town now, cash is gold. No cash, no egg tarts. Capisce? \n\n5. Be patient. Sometimes it will take a little waiting if the egg custards aren't ready or they are out. \n \n6. Don't whine, complain or roll your eyes at them. I have witnessed patrons who whined about how long the wait was and went up to the line to complained to the store owner and she got thrown out of the store.

You can bring it home and put it in the toaster oven (and make sure not to burn the crust) and it's still very good. Actually, it tastes good cold, refrigerated. It always tastes good, but even better fresh.\n\nI also like the coconut tarts they have there. Oh so good!\n\nThey do close at certain times of year for vacation or to make mooncakes (sorta expensive, but good). Lines are common, and sometimes when I pass by and there is no line, I have to go in and get an egg tart even if I'm not craving one. It's like seeing a pig that flies, a UFO, a dog with 5 legs. OK, I've never seen those things, but that's how rare it is or how impossible it is for GG Bakery to have no line.\n\nI've come here from when each egg tart was 80 cents, then 90, then eventually 1.15. It's like I can see inflation in action. Makes me feel old (I'm not right? *pulls out mirror to look for wrinkles, crow's feet, and white hair*) Even though are costly I sometimes buy several since my sisters and/or friends crave them.\n\nI've definitely waited in line for 2 hours before. So though the line looks lik 15 people, it could take that long. Well, the time we came it was mooncake time so people were buying more things. But it just gets to the point where you have waited so long, you might as well keep waiting.\n\nBy the way, if you are in line for an egg tart anyway, can you bring me one?", "author": "Anita C."}

I waited in line for 38 minutes and finally got my hands on some nice hot egg custards.  I immediately ate one, and I was disappointed.  There is so much hype around these egg custards that I was expecting something amazing.  The pastry was nice and flaky, but the custard was slightly undercooked and not sweet enough.  Definitely not worth the 38 minute wait considering I could get egg custards that are just as, if not more, tasty at Garden with a minimal wait at half the price.  I say save your time and skip Golden Gate Bakery.", "author": "Stephanie B."}

I'm still coming back for more!!! \n\nSeriously, you would not be able to find any other custard tart that tastes sooooo good! The pastry part is so nice and flakey and the custard is just.... you just HAVE to try it! \n\nSo yeah, it's a love-hate thing. Love it because its so damn freaking good.

I marveled at my new husband as he dusted off some of his rudimentary Cantonese and ordered us some egg custard tarts and a sesame ball.\n\nWow - everyone has already said the egg custard tarts are delicious.  I concur - what a lovely flake-y crust!  These will haunt my dreams at home (nearly an authentic Chinese food wasteland...with a few oases...none of which are dim sum related).\n\nWe walked across the street so I could snap a picture of the bakery, and then I tasted my sesame ball.  As my hubby looked at me in anticipation of my reaction...I had a moment where a sesame ball nearly brought me to tears.  It was as big as a softball - I understand because it was expertly fried by skilled hands that know the magic way to help them expand.  It tasted so crispy and delicious...and nothing like the sad counterfeits I've had elsewhere...the whole thing made my head swim.  The loving new hubby, the joy of yelp, the delicious taste of sesame fried dough and red bean paste...it was all a bit too much for this Texas girl.\n\nIt's been 2 days...I already miss you Golden Gate Bakery...I hope to see you again very soon.", "author": "Roxanna L."}

Well... that will never happen again!  Golden Gate Bakery has the best egg tarts ever!  As soon as you sink your teeth into the tart, you will know that you're getting a freshly baked tart.  The egg custard is so hot and the tart is so flaky and crispy. \n\nI remember when they use to be about $0.80, which I thought was pretty expensive already, considering other bakeries sold them for only $0.50.  I believe they now sell them for $1.10.  But that makes sense - according to economics, high demand drives the price up, right?\n\nOther things worth mentioning are these cookies that come pre-packaged. I'm not sure what they're called in English, but if I were to translate it directly from Chinese, it would be \"cow ear cookies\" LOL I know it doesn't sound very appetizing, but these choco swirled cookies are very crunchy and make a great snack.  During the mid-autumn festival, GGB also makes moon cakes.  Their packaging is not the prettiest (comes in a paper box), but they make them in a variety of exotic flavors in addition to the traditional white lotus with egg yolk.\n\nThe wait on a normal weekday probably wouldn't be long, on the weekend will probably be around 15 minutes, but during mid-autumn festival... be prepared to wait 3 hours. Yes that is three hours.  And if you're willing to wait three hours, be sure to just pay for parking at the garage and don't park at the metered parking, because you will end up buying very expensive moon cakes.  \n\nLast tip: Be sure to eat the tarts right when you get it - that is when it is the bestest!", "author": "Elaine C."}

Since they're so popular, the ones you get are still warm (and there aren't too many places where the egg tarts are so fresh and warm). The shell is very flaky, crispy and buttery and the custard is light, moist, eggy and sweet.  Though I like the tarts, I wish the bottom of the tart was a bit firmer because the tart falls apart too easily.  Crumbs wind up everywhere!   Also, I don't like the careless way they shove the tarts into a paper bag because they always get squashed that way.  \n\nMy favorite items are actually the sugar topped French buns.  They're so light, soft and airy and the sugar crust adds that extra oomph.  They seem to run out of those quickly too.\n\nI've had some of their other items that aren't as good (baked buns, cookies, etc.).  The curry beef turnover is expensive and the filling is just okay.  The vanilla cake roll is also expensive ($1.25 a slice) and mediocre  - the cake is tough and I found some eggshells in my cake too. Sheng Kee has better cake slices.  \n\nI heard they were famous for moon cakes but I wanted one without the salted egg inside and they didn't seem to have any without eggs.

Over all they are not too nice to cusomters . I saw a woman want to get an extra box from them but the lady (seems like related to the owner somehow) gives her a hard time. \n\nThey will have a vacation once a year and everytime they will post a notice to tell the customers when they will be re-open but 4 out of 5 times i find out that it's not accurate. For example they wil say store will be close from Aug 1st to Aug 14 so when i come back on the 15th , a new notice will be there saying the store will be opened on the 20th. I mean come on , i dont live in the city and everytime if i go there i have to drive 30 miles. If u intent to open on the 20th why dont u just say it at the beginning ? This had happened to me many times. \n\nAlso during the chinese moon autumn festival , they will be very busy too. When u order it takes more than 3 days to get ur order done . Last year we order and told them we will pick up about 5 days later which happened to be a fri , I went there in the morning and the only thing the tell me is that it's not ready yet. It will be ready in the evening but i told them i cannot wait that long cause i have to get back to work on the other side of the bay ! Another lady is having the same issue.

You know those little egg pastries that you find on those magical dim sum carts? Yes, I'm talking about those little morsels of happiness. However, Golden Gate Bakery takes the egg tart to a whole new level of food sexiness.\n\nThe triple threat:\n1) Size: size really does matter. I think it just happens to be a general universal law that big things will entertain your mouth ;) the egg tart of this place is HUGE. It is the big foot of egg tarts.\n2) Consistency: the texture is marvelous. Given it's bigger size, the egg custard center doesn't get dry when baking which makes it this gooey jelly like consistency. If I had to pick something of a similar consistency, I'd pick maybe pudding. And with the juxtaposition of the soft delicate melt-in-your-mouth To the crispy puff pastry shell, it really just slides in. Mmmmm.\n3) Taste: I think this might sound like a complete surprise but these egg tarts have a really strong prevalent egg flavor LOL. Usually dim sum places egg lots of sugar to give the egg tarts a sweet flavor, but this place knows how to please. The egg tart is the diva to this pastry and it does not fail to impress.\n\nThe egg tarts can make everyone happy. Who wouldn't like a big delicious thing slide down your throat? I think these egg-wonderfuls which are famous apparently can stop wars.\n\nTips: it's really a hit or miss with this place timing wise. Apparently it closes on random days. I came during their reg business hrs and it was closed -.- my suggestion is to just stop by when you can, but don't plan on it being open. But when it is open, buy dozens. DOZENSSSS.

In no shape or form is Grant Ave. a part of the Nob Hill Neighborhood. Yelp can be confusing at times...More times than not, actually...\n\n\nGolden Gate Bakery is one of many examples of my rule for eating good Chinese. Notice I didn't say great. That's because great Chinese would take you to Hong Kong and China, NOT San Francisco. If you would take notice, the line that is almost always there is lined up with Chinese folks. Old, young, short, tall...You see them all lined up for one thing and one thing only...Well, maybe something else but the main attraction is the almighty egg custard tart. Dahn Taht. You gotta pronounce the \"ah\" like when you open your mouth and say AHHH!!! except with the letters that start and end it. The best known dahn taht in San Francisco and probably in the entire Bay Area. Maybe even in all of California but that's left to be seen.\n\nLet's start off with the the shell. A flaky, crumbly, buttery-like maybe shortening but could be a mix of all that crust that is delicious. Soooo tender to the touch and melts in your mouth slowly. And if you take notice at how thin it is...Makes you wonder how they can afford to put in that much custard. And the custard! Ohh so sweet and light...You'll love it once you bite into it. You'll try your best to find yourself another dahn taht that is like this one but to no avail. You're screwed! That's why people leave with dozens.\n\n\nNow, to the reason why I left a star off. You must be scratching your heads. Well, the reason is the price. They keep jacking the price up everytime they close the place down for a month or two. Now, I don't live in North Beach anymore so I am not sure if they still do that but under the guise of a vacation, they are actually cleaning the place up for their yearly inspection. You know, that green postcard type thing that rates eateries on their cleanliness. Everytime they close for a spell of time, almost everytime they raise the price. But damn us morons for falling for them. It's amazing at how hooked we are to these things that we will pay the amount just for a taste. Sad, really...\n\nAlso, the way they come out in batches...If you can call them that. They present them on trays from the kitchen where they are prepared. Now, we all know it would make more sense to come out with more than just one tray at a time but the thing is, if they do it that slowly, people would line up and wait. This is making the line extend itself out the door, therefore making them seem like they are hot shit, which they are and always will be until they call it quits or someone totally destroys the recipe. This is called self marketing and strategy. Because they know a crowd will attract an even bigger crowd because we Chinese are gluttons for this kind of stuff.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-04-12", "description": "This place is pretty famous for their egg tarts so when I was in Chinatown with some time to kill I made sure I made a trip to Golden Gate Bakery. I ordered egg tarts ($1.15), a vanilla creme bun ($1.75), and large wife cakes (more than $2 each). \n\nThe egg tarts I got were warm and fresh out of the kitchen. The egg custard is different from most bakeries, it's very delicate and soft. The consistency and texture is a lot like silken tofu. The egg part is good, but I didn't care for the puff pastry crust. At $1.15 a piece they're very pricey and IMO, not worth a special trip. The vanilla creme bun was tasty, but nothing special. The filling has a slightly butter or shortening taste to it and is whipped - I wouldn't buy this again for over $1. I almost never like wife cakes (winter melon filled flaky pastry) and there are few Chinese bakeries that make them to my liking - but when they do I LOVE them. The only other time I've had a wife cake that I liked was when someone gave our family some souvenir wife cakes from Chicago and Golden Gate Bakery is much closer. At over $2 a pop they're not cheap, and I actually think the ones I got that day were a bit burnt. Overall, I don't think Golden Gate Bakery is so super duper special that I would make a special trip to try their goods. Since they're so successful I think they feel that they can get away with charging more than other bakeries in the area. I bought 4 egg tarts, 1 bun, and 2 large wife cakes and it left me $11 poorer. I can get a lot more for $11 elsewhere.", "author": "Monica W."}

I think I have tried egg tarts in majority of the cities I've visited, and Golden Gate is definitely one of the best places -- this list of cities includes Hong Kong!

I swear that've been closed since early August, and I purposely choose a route (through dirty Chinatown) that allows me to walk by this place every day on the way to work, hoping to be greeted by the smell of freshly baked tarted, but to this date, there has been nothing but the feeling of hunger, frustration, and disappointment.\n\nUpdate:\n\nThey are supposedly opening again on Saturday!!!

All the math is done by hand, so you kinda either have to trust the lady or keep an eye on the math. I jet out of there and hop on my train. I sit down to try the moon cake and its pretty decent. I had the lotus seeds and coconut and pineapple. Of the two I actually liked the coconut/pineapple one more. As for the egg tart, someone else ate it before I got to it :( Which brings me to..\n\nMy second trip to Golden Gate consisted of a line as well :( This time, it was only 15 mins long.

That sweet little flakey crispy goodness of a dan tat. I would look forward to Thursdays just to get my hands on a nice toasty warm and fresh dan tat from the one and only GGB. No where else was acceptable. \n\nOne time (actually on many occasions) the family that owns it will randomly close down the shop for days, maybe even a couple weeks, at a time to go on vacation. Of course, they're probably raking in tons of sweet moolah from all the people that line up out side of their little bakery everyday. They can afford to just pick up and go on vacation whenever they want, because they already know, that they already have a set clientele that so devotedly will come back for more upon their much anticipated return. \n\nWhen I was young and stupid, I thought getting any old dan tat from c-town would be ok, I was desparate for one and GGB was closed. So I went down grant and came upon the other bakery (the one with bill Clinton's picture in it) how could you go wrong?!?! Bill Clinton was here!!! But I was so wrong..... thus this brings me back to GGB.... \n\nSeriously, if you like egg custard tarts. You MUST. I really really really mean it. MUST try one from GGB.

They have some squishy looking white dessert that kind of looks like Mochi, but I had no clue what it was. But since it looks squishy, and I apparently have my childish moments, I just had to go and poke at it. Next thing you know, one of the ladies behind the counter throws a little sign onto the dessert platter that says \"DO NOT TOUCH!!\"\n\nthe funny part of it is, she said something in Cantonese pretty loud, but I had no clue what she said since I don't understand Cantonese. But my boyfriend told me that she pretty much said something like, \"and they still keep poking at it.. i don't know what is so funny to poke at it.\" it doesn't sound so funny in english, but when my boyfriend translated to Mandarin to me, I thought it was pretty damn funny.\n\nLast but not least, some important information: parking is very hard to find.

Sorry guys, I was craving Kimchi for some odd reason. \n\nSince it's the mid autumn festival going on, my friend & I literally went in and out of all the streets of Chinatown. \n\nDef try their moon cakes (I tried the one with the yolk inside) & their egg tarts, and I'm telling ya, it was SOOO BOMB...I took a picture of a squishy one since it was too hot for me to hold onto, and I didn't wanna get my hands all oily. I swear, you have to try it when it first comes out, all fresh and shit. You get taken away from all the mid autumn festival madness and wonder where you're at.. The flaky part was super crispy... mm. oh and my beautiful precious looking FAT mooncake. \n\nWhat really annoyed me was watching all these elderly ppl cut in line, and having the Asian blood in me, biting my tongue wondering if I should say something or stand back and respect them..

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-01-19", "description": "As everyone else has said here on Yelp, it is the best egg custard tart in town.  I've waited here for upwards of an hour and a half just to get inside and get my order of dan tats in.  The dan tats are fabulous, especially if you can get the straight out of the oven.  When they are warm, the custard just has this wonderful silken texture and the crust is perfectly flaky.  They are sweet, without being cloyingly so.  We usually try to order at least a dozen, just to compensate for the time we've spent in line.  While we'll eat a couple right off the bat, we save some for the next day and they are still great cold or slightly re-heated.\n\nIn addition to the dan tats, we'll get the wife cakes, though its not as great as the ones I remember from Hong Kong.  However, they are the best I've had in SF, so I'll continue getting them here until I can afford to go back to HK.       \n\nI also like to get the coconut tart - a lovely confection made of the same basic crust as the dan tat, but with a filling of coconut.  The filling again, isn't too sweet and the flavors definitely hold up for eating the next day.\n\nMy sister likes to order what I call the Chinese version of rice krispy treats.  I have no idea what they're called, but they come in blocks and I usually just point to them as I order.  Unfortunately, they were a little dry and slightly stale on one visit, and hence, GGB gets a -1 star for that.\n\nOverall, a great place to try dan tats and other delectable Chinese bakery items.  There is a long wait on weekends, they are closed some months of the year, and they do charge much more than other places, but the dan tat is definitely worth all the aggravation.  I go there every chance I get!", "author": "Angela H."}

Still had to wait in line for 5 minutes which makes me wonder what the hell the line is like during lunch.\n\nYes, the Egg Tarts are the best I've ever had. I can safely say this without inhibition. They are not too egg-y, the custard is silky and almost melt in your mouth, and the pastry crust is so flaky and rich that you can almost feel the butter coursing through your veins. Yes, they're that good. They are worth the heart attack that will later occur. They are worth everything. Do they have crack in them? I don't know, but they are good. Yelp is correct.\n\nBut are they worth $1.10 for one egg tart? No egg tart is worth that price. Yet I will probably go back... multiple times this month... simply because they are delicious and I work not even 4 blocks away...\n\nThe other items I bought today were less satisfactory. The beef curry pastry was tasty, but too greasy. The filling was good, but it would have been so much better as a bao instead with a sweet, almost hawaiian roll quality to the bread dough. I also bought a sesame ball, which was a total rip off. It had a tablespoon, MAYBE TWO of red bean paste in the middle of a ball that was 3 inches in diameter. Mostly air... not even enough rice to make it worth while.\n\nAnd despite these negative points for Golden Gate Bakery, I still give them 4 stars. The egg tarts are just that good. Hell, I'd give them 5 if it weren't for the price and the line.\n\nI managed to feel less bad about my caloric intake by walking up to Coit Tower to eat my tart there.

A side-by-side showdown is physically impossible, you could never get the freshest, just-out-of-the-oven specimen next to each other fast enough.\n\nGolden Gate has the advantage of a madhouse atmosphere where the constant stream of pushy Asian Grannies ensures you'll get the freshest goods. Their tarts are also bigger than Kee Wah's.\n\nI don't advise waiting for the rush to die down because the tarts don't maintain their perfection in the later hours. I bought some around 7 p.m. and the outer layers of pastry shell had hardened. The custard stayed too wet after cooling to room temp, but if you chill it further, it'll set better. Kee Wah gets points here for investing in a warming oven to preserve the quality of their tarts and pies throughout the day.\n\nWhat about the rest of Golden Gate's merch? They have a relatively limited selection of baked goods. I didn't see Pineapple Buns. The Custard Buns weren't on the display. And their set-up makes the shop ridiculously difficult to browse. You better know what you want when you get to the front of the line.

They're a little bigger than the norm (as they should be . . . for that price) and the best part is the crust - buttery, flaky, and mouth watering when fresh and still warm and crispy.

Unlike everyone I go to GGB for the CURRY PIES.  I can't even describe how yummy they are.  It's pure savory goodness stuffed in a flaky pastry.  Try one - you'll see what I mean.  The chicken and beef pies are my favorites.  The pork pies share the stuffing with the bbq pork buns and I find it a little too sweet for my taste.  I have not ventured beyond this point except for the bbq pork buns which everyone seem to love but again I find too sweet and the sesame balls which are also good.  The curry pies and the egg tarts are the winners in my opinion.  \n\nTip:  These items are great for entertaining.  Buy a bunch for your next party - it will save you some work and money and impress your guests.", "author": "mia s."}

I was in the city on the Mission District and felt like a nice walk.  \n\nImagine my surprise when I got to the bakery and there was a line only 8 deep or so.  SCORE.  I stood in line for about ten minutes before one of the surly women behind the counter filled my order.  I got a nice little variety pack of 1-yolk moon cake, egg custard tarts, mochi, and these little coconut things I don't know the  name of.  I had the nagging feeling the whole time I was there that I really wished I spoke Chinese! \n\nSo, what I didn't realize about this place because I didn't read the fine print on Yelp is that it is CASH ONLY.  I should have guessed and I had the suspicion when I saw everyone around me using cash.  Owing to the fact that I almost exclusively use my debit card, I passed it over the counter to the woman, who promptly yelled \"CASH ONLY!\"\n\nSo, I told her to hold that box and I ran directly across the street to Chase (phew) and got some cash.  I returned and took my pastries, the woman was a bit grumpy about it, but in the end, she got her money, so, who cares? \n\n  13.60 for all of this stuff...yes, it's pricey, but hey, every one has to make money.  And not many people can make egg tarts that are so balances...flaky pastry, sweet custard....mmmm.  \n\nCheck it out!  And remember...it's CASH ONLY!!!", "author": "Catrina N."}

THE EGG CUSTARD TARTS.  \n\nUnlike other Chinatown pretenders, these tarts have a light flaky crust, are larger, and not overly sweet.  If you are brave enough, you can ask them to give you the ones which are fresh from the oven. (Say it in Chinese and you get 'bonus' points.)

We would always order by the dozen. That's how much we like them. I remember when I first moved to the bay are my dad would always tell me to go to Chinatown and pick some up before I visited him. He finally realized the bay area is big and I don't live in San Francisco. Also I don't think I would drive there just to buy egg tarts. Parking in Chinatown is just a pain. I would usually either take the bus since I work  in Downtown or have my husband drop me off and he drives around.  I like the egg tarts from Golden Gate because the center is so soft and the shell is so flaky. I always prefer having egg tarts that have a flaky shell rather than the ones with a stiff shell or in foil cups unless they are Portuguese Egg Tarts from Sheng Kee.

After a couple of bites, we headed straight back to the bakery...why you ask? To get ANOTHER DOZEN. No we are not crazy, we just appreciate a good egg tart! It had just come right out of the oven too, so it was just simply HEAVEN. The custard was not too sweet and was of the right consistency, and the pastry part was flaky and delicious. *DROOL*.\n\nThe almond cookies were good too, and the mochi *MORE DROOL*.

I find them enjoyable, yet when the taste of sweetened scrambled eggs kicks in, I'm torn on how to feel.\n\nF.L. and I dropped by Golden Gate Bakery just before 2:00pm on a Friday.  My friend had suggested it when I told him we would be going to Chinatown, and since F.L. had a craving, we stopped by...for an hour.  The line was already out the door, and we parked ourselves at the end of it.  During our 60 minute wait, countless people walked by asking what the line was for and assumed that a line so long must be for something incredibly awesome.\n\nI only tried the egg tarts; I had one freshly baked, as a reward for waiting in line, and the egg custard was warm and pleasantly sweet.  The sweetness and moistness of the custard balanced well with the light, flaky pastry.\n\nI had another egg tart the next day and since the custard had cooled and firmed, it was easier to eat, but just as good.  It still tasted fresh, despite lacking that fresh-baked warmth.\n\nOther notes:\n-You're better off walking, since the street is small and crowded.  (What do you expect?  It's Chinatown!)\n-Of the two women working the cashier and fulfilling orders, there was an older, friendlier woman who spoke pretty good English, and a younger, hastier woman whose English was a bit difficult to understand.  The non-Chinese speaking customers before me had a miscommunication in the price, and there was a good 20 seconds of verbal exchange between them before the older woman cleared things up.

The bag holding the dan-ta was drenched in grease, so were my hands. I had to put the greasy dan-ta in a plastic bag so they don't grease-stain anything else. The dan-ta was okay, It was liquidy and not enough eggs. It's got a eggy flavor but it tasted like it was water-downed. The color wasn't very pretty, it was yellow on the white side, not a solid nice yellow you get when you know they use enough eggs. The crust was not up to my expectations either, it was crumby and made the whole thing bland. \nMy boyfriend had half of one because he was starving, but refused to take another bite afterwards. If a starving person's not eating it, you know there's something wrong with these dan-ta. \nSome people say cold dan-ta is the best, I tried that, I saved it for later, and when I picked it up to try it again, I knew it was a mistake.

Super flakey crust with a sweet enough but not overly sweet custard filling.  I think it's kinda cute that lil old ladies bring them up from the basement.  I also really love how they put the goodies into lil pink boxes, which would have been ordinary, except these ladies tie those cheapy strings around the boxes...they got that down! They also have really yummy coconut macaroons.  I usually buy them by the dozens so that I'll  enough to munch on at the moment and some to bring back home. \n\nOverall, very delicious, but not as cheap as the other stores in Chinatown, but very much worth it.", "author": "Linda Y."}

Did any of the reviewers ever had a decent egg tart in Hong Kong?  If Golden Gate Bakery open in Hong Kong, they will fold in less than 3 months.  Why?  First, the crust is way too oily.  I brought a half dozen of the egg tart home.  They put it in a to go paper box for me.  By the time I was home, the excess oil from the crust managed to soak through the paper cup and the paper box and stain my car seating surface!!!  Not to mention when you finished eating them, your mouth and hand were so oily you felt like you had been munching on a block of warm lard!  A good crust is very tricky to make.  It has to be flaky, rich tasting, and not oily.  To make it flaky and rich is easy,  all you have to do is dumping butter or lard in it.  But to make the crust not oily is where the skill comes in.  In Hong Kong,  the good egg tart's crust is always dry to touch,   On Youtube there are actually some video about what authentic, good tasting egg tarts should look like.  You would not even see much oil on the paper cup that's holding the tart!  And by the way, they are way over price.  The altitude toward their customers should be improved.   The A-1 bakery on Ocean Avenue is way better.", "author": "Frank W."}

So, I was thrilled to read an endorsement of some good sa chi ma.  I don't eat the processed, packaged kind commonly sold in chinese markets.  I don't know if it's because it was dinner time when I stopped by Golden Gate Bakery and the sa chi ma was old, in which case the store should not have sold it to me, but the sa chi ma here was tooth-chipping hard.  I mean, it was like biting into a square rock.  Just ridiculous this was sold to me.  Greedy me, in a moment of glee at the sight of them, got four of them and I had to toss all of them.

It is kind of pricey for egg tarts and in all honesty, it didn't taste like anything special.

Why? Because it's so different from the traditional one and so amazingly good. The shell is flaky  and crunchy, like a Tartine croissant and the filling is creamy, like pudding (firmer but not as firm as the chinese egg custard tart), and, a slightly browned top that's formed by the egg and cream in the custard while baking.\n\nI couldn't tell which kind they make here, but it was just, really really disgusting.

Only after the first taste did I understand the treasure I'd found!!\n \n I just went to Hong Kong 2 months ago and even their most famous dan tat place wasn't as good. \n\nWe're headed up to Napa the end of the month and I purposely made reservations to stay one night in S.F. to pick up some more egg custard tarts from here...no joke!!  Besides the egg custard (best to eat them when they are fresh & warm), I also love the Old Wives Cake.

So what that you have to trek all the way into the middle of Chinatown for one?  So what that you may find yourself crammed into very tight quarters for God knows how long, waiting for a fresh batch?  So what if they're not the healthiest thing for one to nosh on?

As long as I am able to walk out of Golden Gate Bakery with one, two, or six don tats, I am one happy camper.  And I mean happy.\n\nYes, at $1.15 a pop, one of these bad boys is pretty steep (you can probably get one from any other bakery in Chinatown for fifty cents, but don't be fooled by other bakeries' low prices!  Save up your pocket change!  Scrounge around for all those coins you find in between your sofa cushions!), but well worth it.  \"How good could a don tat be?\" you ask?  There's not much for me to tell you except to TRY one, and you'll be instantly converted into a Golden Gate Bakery don tat lover.  Sorry.  I know that doesn't really help, but TRUST me.  The crust is so flakey and buttery, and the egg is so...delicious, I can't even describe it.  Splurge a little, people.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-12-16", "description": "The #1 Place in San Francisco Chinatown for Egg Tarts or Egg Custards, otherwise known as \"Dan Tat\" in Chinese/Cantonese.  Both the locals from Chinatown and tourists from all over gather at this bakery to taste their delicious egg tarts.  Of course, if the locals come here, then you know there is something good about this establishment.\n\nI recently was in San Francisco and decided to venture into another bakery that sold egg tarts (since most bakeries do), which was cheaper than Golden Gate Bakery.  It was about $.75 each, compared to Golden Gate Bakery's $1.25 price tag for each egg tart.  Unfortunately, their egg tart had a thick flaky crust, which made the warm to cold egg tart less than desirable.\n\nI've then realized the secret to what makes Golden Gate Bakery the top place to go for egg tarts, and why people pay a premium for them:\n\n1) Their Flaky Crust is thin (so you get more egg custard in each egg tart)\n2) The Egg custard is cooked just right, and not overly sweet\n3) Usually they are warm/hot since they sell them so fast they always have a fresh batch ready to sell\n\nThe combination of the 3 factors above, make for a wonderful experience when you first bite into the hot \"just out of the oven\" egg tart, causing it to melt in your mouth.  Hence, people eat their egg tart right away when they step outside of the Bakery, to enjoy the aforementioned experience.\n\nNow you know why whenever you walk by Golden Gate Bakery, there is usually a line of people waiting to get in and people outside eating their just purchased egg tarts!", "author": "Edmund Y."}

First, their very famous egg tarts were beautiful and full of finely baked egg custard, however the crust could have been more flaky with extra layers. Next, the mooncakes had a beautiful mold and the saleslady said how \"beautiful\" or good quality they were. So my friend and I both got a box of four with the white lotus seed, two with one egg yolk, two without. They were on the expensive side, about $30 a box. But hey, when can I get fresh moon cakes from San Francisco? After arriving back home that night, we gave them a try.  We cut into the white lotus seed with one egg and saw specks ... of lotus seed? Then I bit into one and found a ginger slice, hmm, new creation? And the egg yolk was very tiny and salty, more like the ones used for jong instead of moon cakes. Overall, a bit disappointing.

I've never heard of it to tell you the truth, but it's a tourist attraction from what I've heard.  And what they're famous for is their fresh baked egg tarts and I do love a good egg tart.  So we get there after lunch from Koi Palace (which some of us waited for about an hour already just for that) and there's a line going out the door from this place.  Probably no more than a shop length's line down the street, so it looked pretty manageable.  We were running short on time to make it to the Chihuly Exhibit at the DeYoung, so I left with others to try to score some tickets.  And unfortunately, we scored only disappointment, but we at least we had a consolation on getting some hot egg tarts.  About 30-45 minutes pass and our friends who were waiting at Golden Gate Bakery come empty handed.  They said it was ridiculous as they waited 30 minutes and the line didn't move one person... not ONE person according to them.\n\nAnd that's not the end of the story.\n\nThey were persistent and determined that day, so they went back to the place before we went to eat dinner.  We ended up deciding to go to R&G Lounge since it was nearby and my friend and I went to get reservations as the others were waiting in line for at least an hour at Golden Gate Bakery.  Good thing, R&G had a bar, because I was drinking the time away as we waited another good hour there sipping my alcohol before I can't stand straight.  And finally, they make it with the goods.\n\nI was starving and ripped the egg tart out of my friend's hand and ate the warm, flaky, custardy pastry.  It's definitely good and fresh (and it better be for that wait), but for 2 1/2 freaking hours for this... I don't know about that.  It's good, but not 2 1/2 hours good.  I was expecting to enter nirvana after eating this, but it did not quite happen that way.\n\nI did hear the reason why it was so fraggin heck slow was that they had half their ovens making mooncakes that day and that slowed down their process, but from what I had, I don't see the huge hype that this place was given.  Maybe I'll try it again on a better day.", "author": "David Y."}

We waited in line for a good 45-50 minutes to place our order. Once actually inside the bakery we waited at least another 15 minutes before anyone helped us. People were coming in the store to \"pick up\" their orders and walked straight in rather than waiting in line like the rest of us. This normally wouldn't be a big deal to me but it seemed like all the people coming into the store to just \"quickly pick up\" their orders were taking longer than the actual customers waiting in line. My wife and I almost walked out after waiting for well over an hour and then to not have anyone help us. It seemed like if you weren't Chinese you weren't going to get helped. Finally, after having three orders jump ahead of me, I said something and one of the older women helped us out. We got a couple coconut macaroons and a few egg tarts. The macaroons were pretty good but the egg tarts were nothing spectacular. Certainly not worth waiting over an hour for.....I will not be going back here again.", "author": "Matt R."}

I was pretty stoked to try their famous egg tart! I have never had an egg tart so didn't know what to expect taste wise. I suppose I was expecting it to be more of a dessertish taste - like more vanillaish - less total egg flavor. Nope, i was wrong. I took a bit and it tasted like biting into an egg mcmuffin (ok that's an exageration, but you get the emphasis on the EGG not tart or dessertis at all). Man, my excitement fell. And i had bought 5 of them to share with the roomate and hubby and have some extra for myself assuming i would be in love with them. Luckily i also picked up a vanilla cream filled pastry with coconut on top - that was delish and totally hit the spot for the sweet item I'd been envisioning. The little ladies behind the counter and over and super efficient and good at pointing out what's 'good' and what's 'really good'.

I also noticed the flies hanging around inside the glass pastry display, and a dead one (no kidding!!) lying on its back on one of their unclaimed coconut tarts.\n\nOkay, I know Chinatown can be a little dirty, but this is disgusting, especially if i just paid double the price!  You gotta be kidding me.  \n\nMy tip: explore Chinatown a bit more, and try some of the other less known bakeries.  This place is hyped by word of mouth because people haven't ventured elsewhere.  But the other bakeries are seriously just as good.  I'm sure that rat is enjoying egg tarts in their kitchen area though, along with all his family and friends.  GROSS.  For your own good, try someplace new.", "author": "Irina L."}

Their pineapple buns are stale and the BBQ pork buns taste like they're left-over from the night before.  I would still come here for the egg tarts if it weren't for the long lines.  Honestly, it's not worth it anymore if you have to fight your way through a bunch of rude Chinese ladies to make an order every time.  If you're not aggressive enough, people who work there will just ignore you...typical of any Chinatown business.  Anyway, I just don't think this place is that special because anyone who's been to Asia before knows that any random bakery can make egg tarts equal to or better than Golden Gate.", "author": "Eric L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-02-07", "description": "Everyone raves about how this little Chinese bakery makes the best egg tarts and mooncakes. Well I'm going to rave about their chocolate roll cake. The egg tarts are not especially tasty, they're just really big. The mooncakes are just mooncakes. They make the traditional kinds with the lotus fillings, egg yolk, and nuts. Older Chinese generations love it but I think for young people, it's just a lot of calories and fat. Now when someone can get haagen daaz to make ice cream mooncakes in America, I will Yelp about that. Now back to chocolate cake. It's not the sweet w/ a little hint of chocolatey bitterness like the ones you find in Western bakeries. The chocolate roll cakes here are moist, light, not too sweet, and come in the perfect size. Well you can buy them slice by slice or in one big roll. I go for the slice. They spread just a little bit of whip cream in the center so you don't get it all over your hands like the ones you buy in Western bakeries. Now... I'm not a big fan of cake. I won't even eat my own birthday cake, but I still can't resist buying a slice of chocolate cake from this bakery every time I pass buy.", "author": "Rennie C."}

It is definitely worth the wait at this Chinatown institution for those flaky, buttery, smooth egg custard tarts that are made to order in small, medium, and large; the curry beef turnovers are flaky with a tender filling of mildly spicy curry beef and vegetables, and the moon cakes popular around Chinese Newyear and the autumn moon fest are sinful with just the right amount of dough and smooth and sweet fillings of black bean, yellow bean, red bean, and lotus paste, the lotus root adding a salty eliment to these decident treats.  Get here early or else expect to wait; no credit cards.  The service, though rushed, is very friendly and the women behind the counter will answer any questions you may have.  So, for sublime Chinese pastries at rock bottom prices with friendly but rushed service in a clean but barebones atmosphere, Golden Gate Bakery cannot be beat.  Keep up the good work guys.!

I went during my lunch break today and was craving some Chinese bakery treats...after wandering for a while I stopped into Golden Gate Bakery because there was a huge line. The huge line was full of Chinese people, not tourists, so I figured this place was good/authentic. After standing around for 10 min like an idiot while people around me were ordering in Chinese, one nice woman took pity on me and asked what I wanted. I didn't yelp this place beforehand, but all other customers were getting the egg tarts, so I decided to get a couple along with some moon cakes. I haven't tried the moon cakes yet, but the egg tarts are wonderful. They're so fresh (still warm after the 10 min walk back to the office) and not too sweet. I wish they had more of the prices advertised in English because I emptied all my change paying for the mooncakes, which were kinda pricey (about 5 bucks for the ones I got).
