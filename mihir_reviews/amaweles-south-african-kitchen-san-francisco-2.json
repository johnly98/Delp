My father had recommended the Frickadelle flap chip roll, but I decided to try their Chicken bunny chow. If I haven't already mentioned ladies and gentleman I am very particular about chicken. A chicken hater if you will. \n\nOver the years, I grew to dislike when chicken is still slightly raw in the center. I also don't like if it is not thoroughly washed and prepped to get rid of the raw smell. Then why do I always get chicken? Well in the hopes that one day, I will come across chicken so thoroughly cooked and delicious of course!\n\nThe chicken chow is chicken curry in a little white bread loaf. They cut the top off. In the hollow center, they scoop the chicken. Then you can rip the bread and sop up the curry.\n\nI ordered the chicken bunny chow with trepidation. My worries were for not. Amawale's chicken bunny chow was everything I hoped for and more. \nHallelujah! There chicken chow was so so amazing and actually spicy!! They used cardamom pods and seasoning so that it tasted like spicy South Indian curry. \n\nYou know it's legit when they use cardamom pods. This curry is more authentic and far better than any curry you will get in an Indian restaurant in the U.S. Bow down to the awesomeness that is chicken chow!\n\nI loved their generous portion size and very reasonable pricing of $8.00. You can definitely share an order with 2 people.\n\nWhen you read the poster on their wall, the fact that it tastes like South Indian curry is unsurprising. It indicates that South African cuisine is a mix of many African people as well as Indians, Malaysians, Dutch etc. \n\nI got the Frickadelle flap chip roll the week after the chicken chow. Amawale's Frickadelle roll comes in a baguette with 2 large beef meatballs, a small amount of lettuce, fresh floppy vinegar soaked potato chips, and plenty of their peri peri hot sauce. This was not as amazing as the chicken chow (3.5/5) , but definitely worthy a try.\n\nI felt that the meatballs were overcooked and wished there was more lettuce to fill up the inside of the sandwich. Towards the end I was eating bread and the peri peri hot sauce. Their hot sauce is delicious though!\n\nI am a huge fan of Amawale's chicken chow.  Due to their generous portions, reasonable FiDi price under $11, and their amazing flavors, I absolutely cannot wait to come back and try their other dishes!", "author": "Uma A."}

Add the touching story about twins from South Africa bringing traditional recipes and techniques, and you a meal with all its layers, from ethnic roots of South African cuisine, to the sisters' passion for cooking, to a Californian sensibility for quality ingredients. (I feel bad hating on Eatsa, but seriously this is so much more interesting and real than generic food with a robotic interface)\n\nAmawele's has a straightforward but diverse menu. Essentially, any dish can be vegan or vegetarian (with butterbeans aka lima beans), chicken, or bobotie (i.e. a piquant ground beef). You can choose cape malay rice (traditional), quinoa (for the basic), paleo (over veggies instead), or bunny chow (a bread bowl, with an adorable name). For something sando-like, there's also a frikadella meatball roll, or curry wraps. Items run around $8-$10, which is very reasonable given the large portions. They are so generous with the chicken!\n\nThe only times I've tried African food include Ethiopian wraps from a cafeteria and delicious roasted meats at Jubba Restaurant in San Jose. The unique spice blends at Amawele's definitely stands out and compares with Jubba's similarly complex seasonings. \n\nAmawele's explains South African cuisine as a melting pot of influences from English, Indian, Dutch, Malaysian and Native African cookery, with some Portuguese mixed in as well. The diversity was screaming in my chicken cape malay rice, which at the base seemed remotely related to turmeric-predominant biryani, with the addition of hearty chunks of chicken that evoked a European theme of a simple yet fragrant stew, combined with a more provocative curry-based Southeast Asian style. Blend in raisins for sweetness, sour cream for a detour, and a handful of spices (the mini flavor explosions are quite intriguing when you come across whole cloves and such!) and you have a cultural masterpiece.\n\nI think my only hesitation is the sour cream; the dish does benefit from a creamy dimension, but I'm gravitating towards something yogurt based or the mythical peri peri sauce. FYI they also make their own rooibus iced tea and peri peri sauce in branded bottles! \n\nService was efficient and very friendly; as for seating, Rincon Center offers several chairs and tables. There's even a fancy indoor rain cloud in the building that incidentally helps with the building's thermoregulation as well.\n\nQuintessential SF workday lunch: authentic and delicious South African cuisine, crafted by two sisters, with quinoa and paleo options available, with a backdrop of eco-friendly indoor recycled rain.", "author": "Edna C."}

You will be full. \n\nLet that sink in.\n\nOK, so I may be biased because I don't work in Downtown, but I have friends who do and they tell me about the ridiculous downtown prices for lunch. Your experience may vary. \n\nTheir menu is small, but definitely unique. Cape malay rice/quinoa. Peri-peri chicken. Frikadella slap chip. Bunny chow. \n\nNo bunnies were hurt in the process of making bunny chow. \n\nI don't think the bunnies will like bunny chow very much either. \n\nI decided to try the frikadella slap chip roll (as in on a bread roll, not a wrap). The chips were fries, slathered in a pink, spicy, vinegary, creamy sauce, hundled together with Dutch style meatballs (frikadella) on a roll. \n\nYes, it's a lobster roll without the lobster.\nYes, it's technically a meatball sub.\nYes, it's a starch fest. \nNo, I'm not on a roll, but the meatballs are.\n\nYou can thank the people who designed that certain T-shirt. You know which one I'm talking about. If you don't, ask a friend. \n\nEating was a challenge. It was pain, it was pleasure, but I guess, no pain, no gain? The roll was too big to shove in my face, the fries too hot, and it was dripping sauce everywhere. Anyone who's had an authentic vindaloo or buffalo wings know vinegar turns spice into pain. Then the cream in the sauce comes to the rescue like the creamy dressing that comes with wings. It's a perpetual mind frik to continually jab your face with fries, bite, exhale as the vinegar drill spice into every corner of your mouth, wow your mouth, and repeat. \n\nFrik is also what they say to the cook when someone orders the frikadella slap chip roll. I don't blame them. \n\nBefore I left, I saw a man receive his bunny chow, a half load of bread loaded with what looks to be their curry. Makes sense. South Africa had/has a lot of Indians and Malays. It wasn't half a loaf of the Wonderbread (or whatever American sized loaf you may use), but it was at least as long as it was wide, stuffed with curry. Good grief, that's a good deal! \n\nVindaloo eaters, how do you eat a whole bowl of that stuff?", "author": "Chi L."}

It is located in a small corner of the Rincon Center Food Court (close to Arabi Mediterranean Cuisine) which is close to my work place. There is a small menu board outside the restaurant on the right that I was walked through by the person behind the cash register when I asked for some help understanding the dishes.\n\nI decided to get the Paleo Meal ($10.50) which is basically some protein of your choice on a bed of vegetables and a side of mashed sweet potatoes and went with the ground beef option for the choice of protein. After about 5 minutes I was on my way.\n\nTaste wise the entire dish was on the sweet side but not too sweet. I would have definitely liked the sweet potatoes mash to be a lot sweeter (it tasted almost neutral) and the ground beef to have a little more spice (it tasted a little sweet) but they worked well together specially after adding the hot sauce (peri-peri?) that I took from the counter.\n\nPrice wise it was in-line with or maybe a tad cheaper that what you would pay at other lunch spots in the Financial District but the quantity of food was almost twice of what you would get at other places. Even I could not finish everything at one go and has some leftovers for the next meal. \n\nOverall I liked what I ate and have made Amawele's part of my regular lunch rotation. Generous 4.5 stars rounded to 5 is how I'd rate Amawele's South African Kitchen (mainly for being authentic).", "author": "Ahmad J."}

Their portion sizes are ridiculously large, and you can feel it in its weight! This dish is like 90% meat. The beef was delicious though and had so much flavor, so I can't really complain. It's served ground up over a bed of veggies and fruit (broccoli, pineapple, raisins, carrots, cauliflower). Whatever seasoning they use--it's perfect! Wasn't really a fan of the potato-like thing that came on the side. Not really sure if it's even potato.

The menu has a mix of modern home cooking and traditional street food ($9-$10).\n\nOn some weekdays I only eat vegetarian. I really like the vegetarian Cape Malay rice with sour cream, and the vegetarian quinoa dishes (both get 4 stars!!). Yeah, quinoa is from Peru/Bolivia, so that's not really South African. It's a modern home cooking style dish. Both dishes can be made with Bobotie (spicy ground beef).\n\nOn my meat eating days, I tried the Bunny Chow (curry served in a square bread bowl) and Curry Roti wrap (choice of same curries on a thick Indonesian style roti flatbread). Both South African street food dishes were just okay (3 stars). Although the bunny is a better value (by volume) than the smaller wrap.\n\nNotes: the curry sauces can be too spicy for some people. So not everyone might like it. Service is friendly, so just ask the cashier if u prefer something less spicy.\n\nCape Malay cuisine (curries, sambal, masala, ginger, garlic, rice, stir fry, etc.) derived from Southeast Asian slaves, mainly Indonesians (influenced by Indian, Malay and Chinese cuisines), brought to South Africa by Dutch colonists.\n\nAmawele's is one of the few SF places that makes Peri-Peri chicken (spicy marinated chicken), a Portuguese influenced dish because they brought South American chiles to South Africa. Peri-Peri is very popular in former British colonies, including Australia. Amawele's Peri-Peri version is a very spicy stew, rather than the whole grilled chicken version available elsewhere.\n\nI wish that South African restaurant chain Nando's opened a location in SF (all US location are in the east coast).

I didn't expect it to be spicy because honestly most ethnic food is toned down for american tastes. And maybe they did tone it down but that stuff had a slow afterburn. Yet I couldn't stop eating. I would take pauses to tear off bread, swish it around in the curry to eat. Slightly less spicy.\n\nI couldn't finish the entire thing, maybe slightly more than half? Dropped off the leftovers with hubby at work and he texted to say \"Yum, curry is so good!\".\n\nI'll have to come back to get that slap chip roll....", "author": "Jean K."}

To my unsophisticated taste buds, it tastes a bit Indian, a bit Moroccan, and probably a bit East African judging by the rich stew-like consistency in some of the dishes. A pair of enterprising twin sisters, Pamela and Wendy Michaelson, have decided to share the recipes of their mother Nadia Drew to create dishes one can assume could be found in a cafe in Cape Town or Joburg (photo: http://bit.ly/15LVAfQ). It's a modest operation nearly hidden away in the Rincon Center and just open for lunch until 3PM, but it's worth seeking out for its authentically eclectic menu (photo: http://bit.ly/10oME1k).\n\nThe challenge, at least in their first few weeks of operation, was that they started running out of several of their specialty dishes as early as noon. I was there around 1PM and found that they only had the $7.50 Durban Chicken Curry Wrap left. No worries, as  I thought it was truly abundant and savory-good with huge shards of spicy stewed chicken curry with tumeric and cumin, potatoes, carrots and other vegetables, all of it wrapped in a thick pita-like bread that had been grilled (photo: http://bit.ly/11RxH5s). It was quite different than its Mediterranean cousin and certainly filling for the price. I just ate it in the food court and needed a fork to take in all its home-cooking goodness. It definitely motivated me to come back and try some of the other appetizing dishes I saw in their display case (photo: http://bit.ly/12umwi0).\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...uniquely savory and hearty fare...South African could be the next foodie magnet\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...just a food court operation, nothing fancy here\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...very charming but oh so hectic during the peak of the lunch hour\nTOTAL - 4 stars...South African fare provides the real rainbow connection", "author": "Ed U."}

Tucked in the far corner, you could easily miss this new addition if you're not aware of its existence.  It feels less like fast food and more like eating from a mom & pop stand.  I know they're relatively new, but I'd love to see some South African drinks and desserts offered.\n\nVetkoek & Ground Beef Curry: Probably my favorite dish on the menu; I mean it literally translates to \"fat cake\"!  It's basically a savory doughnut (no sugar at all) sliced halfway and stuffed with a generous helping of runny ground beef curry.  The fried dough does a brilliant job of soaking up the curry, especially the bottom-center portion of each vetkoek.\n\nChicken Bunny Chow: A thick block of white bread, about a quarter of a loaf, hollowed out and filled with a sultry chicken and potato curry.  Served with a side of tangy marinated carrot shavings which helped cut the richness of the curry.  Apparently it is a pretty authentic South African specialty, originated by Indian immigrants.  It was definitely very filling, I had to take some back to the office for an afternoon snack.\n\nDurban Chicken Curry Roti: Essentially the same chicken/potato/carrot filling as in the bunny chow, expect with a few strands of lettuce.  The roti was thick, more like a Caribbean roti than an India roti.  It held the curry pretty well, despite the filling being so saucy.  Seemed a little skimpy on the chicken though, but other than that, it was totally delicious.\n\nCape Malay Rice: Another permutation of the chicken curry, this time mixed in with rice and tons of vegetables.  Feels like one of the healthier menu options, but that doesn't mean it skimps on taste.  I'd even say this rice dish is tastier than Pakistani biryani since it has so much flavor (especially if you ask for spicy)!\n\nFrikadella Slap Chip Roll: Apparently it's the Danish version of a meatball; the grilled meat pucks totally reminded me of a Middle Eastern kofta kebab though.  Minced meat with tons of veggies and spices.  Served in a medium sized hoagie roll slathered in a very tasty creamy and spicy sauce.  I really liked the concept of adding French fries to the sandwich, but I was disappointed that they were so limp... but according to a South African friend of mine, they're supposed to be so at least they're authentic.", "author": "Adam B."}

I initially thought that was a good sign so I lined up immediately. \n\nI wanted to try one of those paleo meals but the the cashier guy had to talk, excuse me, holler, at the food preparation ladies on whether they had any paleo bowls left. I think he got an answer of 10 mins or they are out of it.  So I asked him to ask again and then he was told that they are out of it. So I ordered a chicken wrap instead.\n\nThe wait to get my food was about 20 minutes which makes me think that the two ladies that I saw buzzing around earlier, were the only two kitchen staff! Seriously?!  My other coworkers went to Yank Sing and got their food in 5 mins and by the time I joined them, they already finished their lunch.  My wrap was then given me stuffed into a very small plastic container with a thin small piece of foil enveloping it. The wrap was actually not bad, curry was legit and moderate spicy in spice level.

But wait times, running out of product during lunch, and lack of information on the menu are things that can potentially undercut their business in the competitive Rincon center environment.

I got the lemon & herb chicken over vegetables, which was flavorful, but I thought the chicken was a little dry.

Don't let the food court location bother you, just go!  \n\nSlap chip roll -- spicy, meaty, vinegar-y goodness.  A fork and knifer sandwich for sure, maybe not best for suit and tie days.  Bunny Chow -- excellent, was our kids favorite.  Its kinda like soup in a bead bowl, but with a chicken stew, almost like a jerk chicken, instead of soup.  Quinoa veggie style -- light and flavorful.  Bobotie -- meat, rice and veggies in a single dish, seems like South African comfort food.  \n\nWish they were open for dinner...this place is too good to be in a food court.!  \nLarge portions, you likely will have enough for the next day.", "author": "Joe P."}

A week later, I looked at the pasta I had made for lunch and promptly abandoned it and headed across the street for some South African food.\n\nAmawele's is located a little south of the corner of Spear and Mission, and you really can't miss it if you head in the first door on the Spear Street side. There you'll find a small booth with a glass display and a chalkboard menu. There's sandwiches and stew-like dishes, but I was drawn to the meat pies. I went right when they opened, so I had to wait a little for my meat pie, but I didn't mind.\n\nMy meat pie was of the bobotie variety, which is a ground beef sweetened with small chunks of fruit and is really pretty spicy. The pie was perfectly flaky and soft, and the bobotie was unbelievably flavorful. I'm drooling as I'm thinking about it. It doesn't like that it could fill you up, but this meat pie is definitely chock full of flavor and fills your stomach perfectly. Just keep a glass of water handy.\n\nIt's definitely more of a take out place, but Rincon Center provides some seating if you need it. Go to Amawele's. Try everything on the menu.

It took a pretty long time to get out food; I came at 12:40 and it took over 30 minutes to order and get my food, but it's really flavorful food and you get a lot for what you pay for. The bowl of quinoa I got had to be over a pound. The dish was quinoa spiced with curry and had a good mix of vegetables, broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, and some starchy one that seemed like a potato, but I wasn't quite sure.. It's a little spicy, which I really liked, but if sriracha is too spicy for you, then this might not be good to order. It was also pretty heavy(not just physically) given that it was only quinoa and veggies, so if you're looking for a light, simple lunch, this might not be the best. \n\nThe bowl had enough food for 2 meals. You could definitely eat the whole thing in one sitting, but it's just enough to make you regret finishing it. The guy at the register has a cool accent and is quite a character.

The bread was quite voluminous and soaked up a good amount of curry and helped out with the spiciness.  You have to take your time as it is quite temperature hot.  The pie crust was quite flaky and the sauce was solid with all of the roasted vegetables.  The food is more like 5 stars.  My main issue is that for being only a lunch place, the portions are a little big.  With the pervading curry scent and taste, it's not the easiest to enjoy at your work desk, and all of your co-workers know you've been here.  I think if they made a lunch portion at a lower price and kept their full size as it is, it would definitely be a step in the right direction.

Things are pretty normally priced - about $8-$9. I got to try the Frikadella roll and the LAST bunny chow. Both were really good -  tons of flavor! The girls are also super nice, overall a win for a FiDi lunch. If I worked closer, I would definitely come here very frequently.", "author": "Christine H."}

There are a lot of great ethnic food places in here to chose from. I ordered the chicken bunny chow. But everything on the menu looks great. A lot of people ordered the sandwiches, and those orders come out faster. My order took over 15 minutes because they gave it to someone who had ordered after me in error. The owner was very apologetic. The curry is very tasty, spicy and just a tad on the salty side. It had potatoes, onion, chicken and maybe green peppers in it. There is a red hot sauce you can eat with it on the side. I love spicy food and I liked the addition of the red sauce, but there's enough heat in the curry, you don't need it. Portion size is generous. No way I could finish it. I liked it just fine and if I lived here would order it again. Be sure to grab the free water, it's sweet and refreshing against the heat of the curry.", "author": "Shelley C."}

I only wish there were some sweet potatoes in here to temper it a bit more. Vegetables are great, but it gets a little watery at there bottom.", "author": "Ashley M."}

I didn't have any reference for food from South Africa going in, but I fear I am now going to have cravings way to often.  Their Bunny Chow (a chicken and potato curry in a hollowed out loaf of South African bread) is to die for!!  I can't wait to go back and have again.  I also had the Slap Chip Sandwich - a meatball patty with succulent and spicy sauces and South African \"chips\" (french fries) served on a hearty roll that I would recommend to anyone looking for a creative and kickass take on the American burger.  I can't say enough good things about Amaweles - if you like spicy food and work or live near the Embarcadero/Financial District, you have to check this place out!!!", "author": "Terence G."}

I was excited to try the peri-peri chicken being a lover of beets and spicy food, and it did not disappoint.  The chicken is very spicy, even by my standards, and I loved it!  Great flavor, although could be considered slightly tart due to all of the hot sauce.  The beet salad was refreshing and the veggies were a nice addition.  I gave it minus one star because the restaurant was a bit difficult to find, and the menu is not self explanatory (unless you look at the display case which does not have all of the items).  I'm also not sure if I received a 1, 1.5, or 2 sized dish...I think it must have been 2 since it is enough for 2 meals.  I would say, however, just choose anything and it is probably delicious.  I will be back soon for the sweet potato curry or the other paleo beef dish.  Looking forward to it.", "author": "Nick T."}

I had their slap chip and it was spicy and lovely.  My friend had the sweet potato curry thing, which was also delicious.  I will warn that they mean the spicy, but it's not just heat-actually had spices involved in the spicy!  The food court vibe is not my favorite, but this place is worth going to.", "author": "Paul W."}

Didn't have a clue what it would be and it ended up just being all these new yet familiar blends of tastes and spices in my mouth. Definitely go here!!!!!! At the back left corner of the Rincon 2. Also, the workers are super nice!!", "author": "Alexander M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-02-20", "description": "A coworker came back from Amawele's with a little pot of hot sauce that was so delicious (it had the perfect balance of vinegar, heat and spice) that I needed to go and try the food for myself.  I ordered the Frikadella wrap and it has said hot sauce, although it was tempered down into an aioli, and it was good.  In the wrap, you get two meatballs, that were ok although a little gamey, vinegar doused french fries which were delicious, a few lettuce leaves, and a generous dousing of the hot sauce aioli. The wrap itself is dense and a little sweet. First bit was pleasing but halfway through my mouth was on fire (I should let you know that I generally order mild or medium heat when eating out). The cashier was funny as he repeated my name at least half a dozen times to ensure he got the right pronunciation and the portion was decent.  Price was a little on the higher side for what you get but the hot sauce was complimentary (not that you need more of it if you order the Frikadella) as was the sweetened water.", "author": "C L."}

If you are the type of person who enjoys the experience of an explosion of flavors in your mouth, this is definitely the place for you! They use bold spices and ingredients that honor authentic South African food, so what you are getting is for sure the real deal! If you go crazy about spicy food this is the place to go. Bunny Chow would be the way to go for having an spicy experience. For those who are taking care of their diet, the paleo meals are a great option. I personally like the chicken curry wrap, it has the perfect combination of flavors, it is not spicy and it is filling. I really like the wrap, which is called roti, NOT tortilla. Me being Hispanic, means that I know what a tortilla is and they are both very different. Roti is a traditional flat bread that complements many dishes in South African cuisine. It is usually handmade, rolled and cut into perfect circles. Amawele's roti have a some sweetness that adds an extra special touch to the chicken curry wrap. So, please do yourself a favor and go to Amaweles's South African Kitchen and have a meal experience that you will never forget!", "author": "Liri Q."}
