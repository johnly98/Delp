I've been going to the Haight Street one for years and been coming to this location for the past 5yrs on a monthly basis, usually when I'm at The Make Out Room across the street. Both locations are slightly different but are more so the same.\n\n If I'm up for two slices I usually get a meat slice, usually the pepperoni and follow up with a pesto. I have never been to NY so I can't compare to NY pizza but this place is one of my favorite pizza places and I am someone who knows pizza well. I also like a variety of pizza places so all I can say is for you to try it and see how it goes. Judging pizza is almost like judging a burrito. Not one place is the best. It depends on the day of the establishment and depends on the establishment you're in the mood for.\n\nSo I say give it a try. Also the staff here has always been super cool. \n\nPS even though I don't come all the time I always carry their punch card!", "author": "Majid S."}

After years of enjoying escape from ny pizza, I've decided to end our patronage. What started off as a love affair with the *you say potato* pizza, an awesome happy hour at the downtown location, and super tasty salads has become a series of super disappointing delivery experiences. The last three times we've ordered pizza from here the pizza has been subpar: either sloppily made, poorly transported, burnt on the bottom, or made with clearly expired dough (see pic). I realize businesses change and the closure of the location in the Castro was very disappointing but paying close to $100 for pizza to be delivered only to get pizza that is embarrassing to serve to my guests was the last straw.

The thought of having potatoes on pizza sounded unappetizing to me. \n\nI freakin' loved it!!\n- The potatoes were sliced thin enough so that the taters were nice and crispy. \n- The roasted garlic cloves were so soft and sweet, delicious! \n- My only complaint was that there wasn't a lot of the pesto, I wanted to taste more pesto in each bite. \n\nThey also have gluten-free crusts avail. But it's only avail in medium/14in crusts, and will cost you an additional $4.\n\nThese hours are for the Mission location only:\n- In-store hours: Sun-Wed 11am-12am, Thurs-Sat 11am-2am.\n- Pick-up & Delivery: Sun-Wed 11am-11:45pm, Thurs-Sat 11am-2am.\n\nThere's at total of 5 locations in SF: \n- Mission\n- Soma\n- Haight\n- Polk\n- Downtown: Think this is the only place that has happy hour from 4pm-6pm. $2.50 per slice and draft beer is a steal!\n\nThanks a bunch, Escape From NY!

I applaud you, and thank you for wrapping up my late nights/early mornings so well.\n\nThe pizza is very good. I particularly like the mushroom pizza. I also dig that they heat it up from you. Really sets it apart from heated by heat lamp pizza. For this, I thank you, EFNYP. \n\nThe line can be long, but goes quickly. \n\nSometimes you have to scour your fellow patrons for the parm or the chili flakes, but fear not, likely besotted customer: they are usually around.\n\nThe good: big slices, big attitudes, good price.\nThe bad: good luck getting into the bathroom.", "author": "Amanda B."}

The pizza itself tastes okay but is nothing remarkable. First go round I got pepperoni, the crust pretty much has no flavor so I didn't bother eating it. Second time I got one of the BBQ chicken pizzas, which I think was put together by someone stoned out of their mind because all the bacon was heaped in one corner, and the chicken in another, so some slices didn't even have toppings on them. Also strangely the toppings were cut into enormous pieces, kind of unmanageable. \n\nWhat I will say though is the delivery guys for this place are awesome. They are so friendly, above and beyond really, also accommodating as I asked them to call instead of ringing my doorbell so my dog wouldn't bark. They always say the pizza will take an hour but it seems to show up in about 35 minutes, so that's nice. \n\nWill probably order again because it's easy and nearby, but there's nothing special about this pizza.", "author": "Beth D."}

This escape is a disappointment.\n\nTechinally half of the customers that do go here are probably smoke way way too much J's or drunk way way too much to remember what great food taste like.\n\nThe only pizza dish I could say was great, was the Potatoe and Garlic. It's sometimes call 'You say Potato'.What's with the silly names: 'U say Potato' should be known as Garlic and Potato Pizza. There are others such as 'Elementary My Dear Watsonville'. That pizza is a Artichokes and Tomatoes. What's wrong with calling it, an Artichokes and Tomatoes Pizza?What's a 'Andy Warhol', do I really want to find out? Isn't Andy Warhol known as the guy who got shot by a crazy drug addict model girlfriend? What's with these stupid gimmick names?! If you call it a different title, couldn't they have thought of a easier name than that. Why are they calling their pizzas, pies? It's confusing as hell.\nThe pesto pizza is dry.Pesto Pizza based on the menu are not found in New York, huh?Normal cheese pizza might be undercooked. There is really nothing remarkable about them at all. They might look good, but my taste buds don't say the same.\n\nThe next thing on the list: 3 dollars for one slice of pizza that had little taste. The place is expensive. Waste of good money. Yes, they do free fast delivery and you do have the choice of making your own combination pizzas, good salads, but it's still sucks. The soda 12.oz can for 1.15 is a rip off. \n\nNow the location: there is a lot of 'celebrity' autographs and photos on the wall, that looks cool. The guitar in the case is tight.

My cred: I grew up in a college town near Chicago, where pizza is a religion, and I was a very dedicated disciple. Serrano's is not intentionally hip. *Hip people may go there,* but it's just a pizza place that is doing everything right. Jesus, I've had *way* more pretentious pizza in this town - Pauline's, anyone? - but Serrano's? No. In fact, they were so unhip, they went through a phase of handing out little cards that pushed a real estate biz one of the owners had on the side. Yeah, if you closed a deal with him, you got like $300 worth of pizza or something. It was hilarious. Did I give a shit? No. Their pizza is classic and perfect.\n\nI was happy with Serrano's being the only pizza place in this neck of the woods. I considered myself fortunate. If EFNY forces them out of business, we as a city will have reached a level of lameness I previously thought unattainable.\n\nI suggest you program Serrano's # into whatever crazy-assed thing you are using as a phone, and when you get the urge for quick pizza, take a deep breath, dial, and wait the extra 10 minutes.

That was a great gesture but I had folks I needed to feed in a certain time frame, there was no time to wait for another delivery so I asked them to remove the charge from my credit card and they said it would.\n\n- Later that day I checked my credit card statement and they charged me for the full amount.  I called them and the manager told me to call and talk to a different manager tomorrow....", "author": "Jinenne S."}

I don't care how many times I've tried Nizario's, Marcello's, Serrano's, or Blowjo's - this is my favorite. \n\nThe ingredients are fresh and the potato-garlic-pesto is so good, I can't not get half the pizza to have it when I order.\n\nTip for ordering in person by the slice: scan the pizzas that are there for the taking.  Order the one that glistens the most.  It is the freshest and greasiest and will taste the best.", "author": "Christian H."}

I was ordering 2 slices and was more than $5 dollars. That's for sure. I told the cashier or server or whatever I have not enough cash. She says I can use the ATM there. I am not going to pay extra fees just for two slices of pizza when other places take credit cards or must pay a certain amount instead of CASH ONLY ON SLICES!!!

This is strictly because I've stopped by three times and got slices to go and the pizza tastes totally different than when you get home delivery.  They reheat it and it looses it's awesomeness.  It's way better delivered.  And they don't have to-go boxes. They slap on another paper plate on top of your slice and put it in a paper bag.  I'm telling you, order delivery., and if ordering online, ask for the WHOOODEEEHOOO instead of the knock or door bell.

And I would be back in perfect time for my pizza. When I came back, my pizza was done....or so I thought. They had burnt the pizza. The guy at the front was very apologetic. And we only waited for another 10 minutes for our new pizza. He apologized again, let us keep the \"burnt\" pizza (we figured we could pick off the top and the crust) and gave us 4 free slice vouchers (probably a $15 value!). This was much nicer than what Celia's did to us. They once delivered us a half burnt pizza like it was nothing.
