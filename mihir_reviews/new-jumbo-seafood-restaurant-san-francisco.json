If you are lucky, you can find a spot right in front of the restaurant on Noriega. Otherwise, be prepared to drive around the area. My family loves authentic Chinese food so we had to check out this place. \n\nWe had a reservation for a party of 8 at 5:30PM on a Saturday. The restaurant was packed - there were a few tables hosting a social event so it was lively. Despite the restaurant being so busy, service was quick and they came to check our table often. The food was delicious! Some of the highlights are reviewed below. \n\nYam and Wolfberries Turtle Soup \n* Very comforting on a cold day \n\nYang Chow Fried Rice \n* Rice was not mushy or oily \n* It was packed with flavor from the dried scallop pieces\n\nHouse Special Spare Rib w/ BBQ Sauce (my favorite) \n* Meat was tender and juicy \n* Sauce was delicious - sweet with a hint of soy sauce in every bite\n* Leftover sauce was so flavorful with rice\n\nCrab w/ Salty Egg Yolk (another favorite) - It was messy to eat but I was impressed by the flavor combination \n* It was salty but it didn't overpower the dish \n* Crab was slightly sweet and tasted very fresh \n\nSauteed Lobster with Ginger and Scallion \n* Flavored nicely with ginger and meat was soft but still had a bite to it \n* Noodles on the bottom were a little too soft \n\nFamous Deep Fried Squab \n* Meat was so tender and juicy \n* Skin was golden brown and crunchy \n\nOverall, the food was great. However, I just want to mention that you should eat at your own risk - Yelp warns of a poor food safety score. \n\nOur bill was a little over $400 with tax and tips so that's about $50/ person.", "author": "Courtney H."}

I would agree with most of them. However, I can tolerate the service (or lack thereof), flies, grease, and what have you if my fam is pleased with the food. \n\nWhile engaged in meaningful conversations with each other, my fam is surrounded by authentic dishes that revive old memories in China.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-11-30", "description": "More on the 3.5 stars.\n\nMy parents really wanted me to try the wasabi marinated pig stomach with chicken here, so there I went with the family! I arrived at about 1pm on the weekend and it was busy, but not packed. My family (4) were seated pretty quickly. I am told that from the time of 11am - 1pm, there is a steady flow of people going in and out, which I kind of saw. Pretty good indication to me that ingredients don't sit and some people actually like the food.\n\nUpon seating, we were given the complimentary tea and Chinese soup, which was okay. Pretty basic and standard soup provided at a Chinese restaurant in SF. We ordered one squab (pigeon), steamed three-egg dish, wasabi marinated pig stomach with chicken (yellow - wong mo), house special spare rib, and stir-fry pea shoots with garlic.  \n\nSquab: pretty dang good. Having had the Hong Kong squabs and my parents' praise, their squab is pretty similar to the HK squabs. Tastes very similar, but just a notch below in that the squab itself wasn't as moist and juicy. But that can't be helped if it's an ingredient issue. Nice that they provided the 5-spice salt with the squab too (as it should come with).\n\nSteamed three-egg: We simply just wanted to try it and it isn't bad, but as expected, a bit lacking. The three eggs are salted egg, regular egg, and preserved duck egg (century egg). The egg batter wasn't whisked enough, because when you spoon the egg upside down into your bowl, you can see the egg white and yellows are still separated, and not uniform. You can't see it on the top, because soy sauce was used to mask it. There was also very little salted egg and preserved duck egg, but that's expected. The egg batter was steamed pretty well as it was very smooth and silky, but given the thickness of the dish, I would certainly hope they can steam it well.\n\nHouse special spare ribs: Again, simply wanted to try it. My family aren't a huge fan, but it was worth a try. The sparerib comes out in a special bake ware and smells great. The sauce isn't the American BBQ sauce, but it's the Chinese BBQ sauce where yellow sugar, soy sauce, and dark soy sauce (and some other sauce) is mixed. The spare ribs were most likely fried and then re-baked with the sauce. Quite tender and there wasn't a thick layer or fried batter/flour. \n\nWasabi marinated pork stomach with yellow chicken: My goodness. First off, the pig stomach and chicken were great in that the presentation looks amazing. The only downside was that the wasabi was too strong and my family can eat wasabi. Our sinuses were cleared and we definitely had a few more coughs than we should have during the meal. Aside from that, the pig stomach had a crunchy bite (some pieces did and some didn't), didn't have the foul pig stomach smell, and the chicken mixed well with the wasabi marinate with the pig stomach. The dish overall was nice to eat - just minus the overly strong wasabi. It's funny, because when we asked the server if the wasabi is mixed when ordered, and he said yes. We said it was a bit too strong and to let the chef know for next time, and he said to just let the dish sit and let the wasabi disperse. (Laugh!)\n\nStir-fry snow shoots with garlic: Basic stir-fry vegetable dish and they did it pretty decently. The garlic wasn't minced, but it was pan-fried and used to stir-fry with the snow shoots. Came out steaming hot and didn't taste 'old'. Pretty solid stir-fry for this dish.\n\nOverall, I did like the food and wouldn't mind coming back again for the wasabi marinated pig intestine with chicken and squab. I think this place is worth a try and depending on what you order, you can be surprised. \n\nSide notes: Looked like a lot of local workers tend to come en masse to enjoy a meal together. Even on the weekend, we noticed some Asian construction workers eating a meal together at one of the large round tables. On another note, the restaurant does appear to be understaffed. Last note, they do charge rice.", "author": "Alex W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-04-20", "description": "Quality of food is eh here. Came here for dinner here tonight because a family relative recommended us try come for their fried squab. \n\nEnvironment: \nVery spacious and lots of seating. There are many tables in the restaurant with comfortable chairs. I actually really enjoyed the dining space inside--table cloth and the set-up reminded me of a higher end banquet-style restaurant. However, I felt slightly uncomfortable because of the attentiveness of the staff. There were several staff that were standing in the back watching intently at those that walked in. Not sure why they were so alert. We arrived at 6:00pm and less than half of the restaurant was filled.\n\nFood:\nOverall, not really pleased with the food. Food is generally pretty good, but needs work in terms of seasoning and flavoring.\n\n-Braised Lamb w/ Mushroom (2/5): Upon first glance, the clay-pot dish looked very fancy. I was quite excited since I really like lamb. After taking a bite of the lamb, I was disappointed that all I could taste were flavors of salt and ginger. Tofu skin was dry. The lamb was very tough as well. Not very flavorful.\n\n-Chicken and Salted Fish Fried Rice (4.5/5): YUM! This one was definitely a standout. I am a big fan of salted fish fried rice, so when I saw this on the menu, I was certain I wanted to order this. Exactly how I wanted it to taste--not too oily or dry! The only reason why I didn't give it a 5/5 was because the fish was very OVERLY salty. Otherwise, it would've been perf!\n\n-Ribeye Steak w/ Mixed Mushroom (3.5/5): Ribeye steak was extremely tender. The dish was filled with flavors of garlic and sweet soy sauce; really delicious sauce and the mushrooms were delicious! This dish was also salty (more than the braised lamb w/ mushroom). \n\n-Clams w/ Black Bean Sauce (3/5): Not a big fan of black bean sauce, but the sauce was pretty good. The clams were very watery and tasted bland. Flavors of the sauce didn't seem to have seasoned the clams very well. The only good part was the bell peppers and onions.\n\n-Deep Fried Squab (4/5): Must-try! Tender and soooooo juicy! The flavors of the squab were delicious. The skin of the squab was the best part--super crunchy and so satisfying. \n\nService: \nWhen we walked into the restaurant, our waiter didn't even greet us. He was on the phone and made us wait several minutes. When my dad suggested that the lamb be cooked longer because it was really tough, our waiter said that other customers like it just the way it is and questioned his thoughts. Food arrived fairly slowly too. \n\nLast Thoughts:\nOverall, I thought the food was alright. There are definitely better Cantonese restaurants than this one. Low marks of the night were that the dishes (ribeye steak, braised lamb, and fish from the fried rice) seemed all-around really salty. Don't think I would come back again.", "author": "Rebecca C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-04-01", "description": "So I'll agree with some points that have been previously made:\n\n1. Maximum capacity? Yeah. Not really adhered to. It's more about maxing profits. Our table was literally backed into another table with very little room to maneuver around.\n\n2. Customer service is totally not existent. Aside from the lady up front, all the other waitstaff are pretty incompetant. It takes a lot of effort to flag one down because they are tunnel visioned on turning tables as fast as humanly possible.\n\nBut where these two points raise a few red flags, I do have to say that since their remodel...their food is generally back to being top notch.\n\nMy favorite dishes of the night where the green beans with salted fish and ground pork and spareribs. The green beans, despite being chopped to bite size, were still crisp and fresh. Flavors were pretty strong from the salted fish and from the chili oil, but my brother and I basically competed for this dish opting for thirds....fourths even. Second favorite were the house spareribs. The meat was crisp yet tender and tossed in the most delicious honey, garlic, soy reduction! \n\nAnother standout of the night was the fried rice. It wasn't too oily or dry and was tossed with just enough snow peas and dried scallop to really accentuate the flavor and textures.\n\nAs for the rest of our dishes, we thought they were all still good. The pork neck was incredibly juicy and tender and the shrimp was clean but difficult to eat with a honey based coating and shell on. The low marks of the night included the flounder which was deep fried a bit too much and the ginger chicken clay pot which had too many bones imo.\n\nAll in all, very consistent meal from Jumbo!", "author": "Elaine Y."}

Yes our table was super cramped and it felt like there was very little room to walk, but I took it all in stride as I don't expect too much from Chinese restaurants. \n\nTheir menu was interesting to look at...they have sections like \"Good Food\", \"Preferred Dishes\", and \"Chef's Specialties\". Luckily we came prepared. My coworker recommended we get the fried squab as well as the spare ribs (there were mulitple pork rib dishes but the popular one is the house special spare ribs in bbq sauce), so we ordered those two dishes along with beef chow fun and a veggie dish. They were all pretty good picks, especially the spare ribs! \n\nThe squab meat was very tender and flavorful, though ultimately a little harder to eat because of all the bones. The spare ribs were soft and juicy and also had really good flavor. I couldn't pinpoint what flavors went into the sauce, but it was the perfect blend of sweet and savory (a combo that I usually don't like that much). My friends spooned all the extra sauce from the spare ribs into their bowls to eat with the rice, it was that good! The beef chow fun was pretty standard, a little on the bland side but that's not a bad thing to have less sodium in your food. There was also complimentary red bean soup for dessert after we finished our meal.\n\nFood came out very quickly after we ordered, and service was decent; we didn't have too much trouble flagging the servers down for stuff. \n\nAnd our meal was SO cheap too, only $15 pp after tax and tip. I really need to start eating out \nat Chinese restaurants more often!\n\nParking was a little bit difficult on a Friday night as the restaurant is in a busy area of Noriega. All of the metered spots around the restaurant were full, but I got lucky with a residential spot 3-4 blocks away.\n\nAs we were walking to our table, almost every table we walked by had ordered some kind of crab or seafood dish (makes sense, given the name of the restaurant and the fact that crabs are in season), so next time I definitely want to order some of that yummy crab as well!", "author": "Dianna H."}

Maybe for all the unique, authentic/traditional dishes that is. But IMO, I dislike this place for several reasons. \n\n1. Maybe it's the other customers, maybe it's the restaurant...but either way, there are too many damn ppl in this little place. I'm PRETTY sure that the limited amount of walking space up in here is a fire hazard. AND the other customers get REAL, REAL aggressive in the TINY little waiting area up in front (that should be for 5ish ppl but 25 ppl try to jam themselves into). People have no chill here. At all. \n\nMy family was seated in the large table near the front window tonight for a party of 13. Since it's their biggest table in the restaurant, we had to be seated there. The worst part is that that table is RIGHT next to the TINY waiting area. My cousins hubby got elbowed by one person, smacked by a purse from another, andddd one lady literally leaned so far back onto him that her hair was on his head. WTF. PERSONAL space is not a real thing apparently. \n\n2. The waitstaff here literally hate their lives. For the amount of ppl in this restaurant, the waitstaff to customers ratio is completely disproportionate. Do not bother asking for water, napkins, missing food (this has happened every time I've been here), or anything beyond your order, bc they really dgaf. I'm usually less opinionated about Chinese restaurants service if good food balances it out, but this place has got some of the absolute rudest service I've ever seen and not good enough food to justify the rudeness level. My aunt had to tell one waiter to be a nicer human being bc that was how much attitude he had.\n\n3. Bc the fam likes this spot SO much, I sometimes have to just sit thru the meals here even though I'd much rather be somewhere else. Anywhere else. TWO times I've found foreign objects in my food. Once was a staple in my veggies?! that I could've choked on. So disgusting. Another time was hair in my noodles. So gross. Some of these visits were followed by stomach aches (not surprising). \n\nTBH, the quality of food here (that I've had), the lack of service level (which I typically forgive if the food is good, but it's not worth it here), makes me barely able to give them 2 stars.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

For example, their crab is usually about $37 but they raised it to over $53 during Chinese new year. The price for the same dish varied for over $15 in one month! To me, that is just pure greed 3) I ordered a duck egg crab today and it came out to be stinky. I had only a couple bites and complained it to the owner/the lady in the kitchen because I didn't want to make a scene. I told her I have ordered this duck egg crab many times in the past and I am 100% certain today's crab or the duck egg was not fresh. I have a sensitive stomach and I could get violently sick if I had some bad seafood. The owner/the lady became defensive, rude, and physically violent (she accidentally hit my hand with her big gestures), and refused to let me return the dish. Then they chef (a tall guy) came out and yelled at me. They both tried to intimidate me and created a huge scene.

We decided to go here tonight for dinner so we couldn't really think of any other options and I wanted to see what all the rave was about. \n\nThis restaurant is located on Noriega St. and parking is all on the streets. It's a pretty big sized restaurant in my opinion with a good number of small tables and large tables. Bathroom is located all the way in the back. \n\nMy family and I got here around 6pm and thank god we did 'cause a line started forming after we were seated. The restaurant was pretty clean and the menu had a load of options to choose from so I was pretty excited about the food here. Yelp recommends the squab and the spare ribs so I got both of those and we also got string beans and cold pork stomach. They have a lot of items listed as \"house special\" which makes you think it's gonna be great except it's probably a lie. \n\nThe spare ribs are good except until they get cold and it gets super oily. Cold pork stomach didn't have much flavor to it and the string beans were okay, but not insanely flavorful. The only thing I could probably recommend to you is the squab. They don't give you big cuts, but the skin was crunchy and it's good when it's dipped in some salt. \n\nMy biggest problem was the service. Now I read on the tips section that service here isn't really all that, but I didn't think much of it because I believe that everyone has off days. Unfortunately, I guess I was just being too nice. We had already gotten our dishes when my mom asked a waiter if she could add one more dish and the waiter actually had the balls to say no because they were too busy. I get that there's people waiting for a table, but I've never actually heard of a waiter rejecting a customer. Like, wtf. Okay, fine. And then when we were packing up our leftovers, we had a wet dish so my dad asked for a plastic container instead of the paper one, but the lady boss told him \"no, it'll work just fine.\" Uhm, rude. \n\nOverall, food wasn't all that and service sucked.

The worst part is if you pay with card, the owner fills in the (always 15%) tip and total amount before handing you the receipt to sign. She also rounds up the total amount to the nearest dollar amount. So if your subtotal comes to $75.50 and the (automatically deducted 15%) tip is $11.33, the stingy owner will write your total amount as $87 instead of $86.83, along with other questionable additions to the receipt (your orders aren't listed so you can't tell if it's totaled up correctly).\nSTAY AWAY FROM THIS RESTAURANT AND ITS SHADY OWNER.", "author": "Derika L."}

However, there is an upper limit to my patience, and Jumbo has exceeded it.\n\nMy family and I came here for my dad's birthday at my grandma's request. She's the type of lady who will complain if she doesn't get what she wants, so we gave in. The four times we visited in the last 6 months or so, we've eaten here twice, mostly because there's always a huge wait for a table...around 45 minutes or so. The other times, we elected to go somewhere else instead. Experience has been the same here both times.\n\nOnce inside, it'll be crowded and loud. If you grew up having family dinners at Chinese restaurants, you know what I'm talking about. Loud yelling everywhere, children running around while parents are shooting the shit at the table, waiters bumping into your chair, etc.\n\nWith the huge wait and crowded restaurant, you would expect great food...but you'd be wrong. The food here is merely okay (2 stars for being reasonably tasty). The fried items such as fried chicken wings, fried flounder, sweet and sour pork ribs are over fried. The other items tasted like any other Chinese restaurant in the area. The seafood items being brought to other tables -looked- good, but my family wasn't down to buy market price crab, what with the shortage recently. Portion sizes were also laughably small.\n\nI suspect the huge wait is not for great food, but merely being a prominent restaurant in a largely residential neighborhood. Service is slow (I suspect the restaurant is understaffed to reduce expenses), and the diners even slower. In addition, service is slow thus creating a bottleneck. My family and I waited 20 minutes to even have our order taken. The upside was that our food came out fast.\n\nService towards us was cold at best, but mostly rude. I suspect this is because we don't speak Chinese like the other patrons (we are indeed Chinese, fyi). Part of this is language barrier, but also culture. I experience this cold treatment whenever I go to an establishment like this...I'm never surprised, but always disappointed that this still happens in this time and age. While other patrons received warm and welcoming service, we weren't even served the complimentary dessert (as we saw given to other tables).\n\nOverall, this restaurant is your run-of-the-mill Chinese restaurant.", "author": "Denise C."}

I certainly didn't expect that since its kind of hidden (Noriega & 23rd.) My mom brought here because she always drove by and wanted to try it. Glad we did. The service was alright, I don't have high expectations for chinese restaurants anymore - but they were decent. We kept it simple, ordered squab (apparently they're really popular here) some gai-lan, and a meat dish (I forgot what it was now that its been some time since I visited.) Overall, flavorful dishes that felt like home cooking. \n\nWill I be stopping here post travel into SFO, you bet I am!", "author": "Leanna S."}

Everything we ordered, except for the squab, was covered with a sweet and salty gravy. It was very unappetizing. \n\nI would say come here and just get the squab and some rice and be done with it, but I'm concerned about what they do with the rice. We wanted to pack what little rice we had leftover along with our other leftovers, but the owner lady quickly whisked the rice bucket away. She disappeared back into the kitchen with the bucket so quickly that we didn't even get a chance to stop her. When she came back out, we said we wanted to pack the rice to go also. She said she doesn't allow that, but we can eat as much rice as we wanted if we ate it there.\n\nAlright so... what are you gonna do with that rice? Serve it to other people?\n\nThen jokingly, my mom said, \"oh if we knew we would have eaten more rice.\" Then the owner lady snaps back, \"you can eat as much as you want, but if you get sick then it's not my fault!\"\n\nUm, excuse me?\n\nI hate to think about other people's chopsticks digging into a common pot of rice after it's been in their mouths, and that same rice is served to others. Ew!\n\nI would understand if we asked for a fresh pot of rice and then decided to take it to go, but we didn't even get a refill for the rice (we had 5 people) so there really wasn't much left at all. I can't think of what they would do with the leftover rice but dump it back to serve to other people.\n\nService overall wasn't great anyway, except for one of the ladies who brought us soup and tea in the beginning. She was nice. The waiter that took our order kept trying to get us to order their seafood. Yeah... $32 for crab or some type of clam for $14 a pound. We were just there for lunch, dude!\n\nSafe to say we probably wouldn't come back here unless we really, really wanted roasted squab.", "author": "Sara K."}

After the renovation and change management, this place has made major improvements. My grandpa used to always want to go to Jumbo back in the days. He liked the huge huge portions and low prices. Grandpa is all about quantity over quality so we'd always end up there for family dinners, while I'd think in my head....\"Again???\" on countless occasions! The old Jumbo was what you would classify as a whole in the wall Chinese restaurant that you know is usually unclean and the service is far from stellar. Don't even mention the restrooms! Anyway, out with the old and in with the new!\n\nLast night I had dinner with la familia (13 deep). Yes, it was grandpa's request again but thank goodness it's the New Jumbo! We ordered many dishes as follow:\n\nRoasted squab - good but some pieces had little meat.\nSteamed chicken - standard.\nMustard greens with sea cucumber - not enough sea cucumber...sliced too thinly.\nStir fry veggies with fish fillet - my favorite dish of the evening. \nFried rice - standard, but a little greasy for my taste. \nStir fry veggies with chinese sausage - did not eat bc I don't eat sausage, noticed it was the only dish unfinished.\nSteamed tofu - OK but nothing special.\nSweet and sour fried tofu - did not try but others said was good. \nStir fry mushrooms, veggies and fish cake - alright. \nStir fry veggies with pork neck - OK but not enough meat.\nWhite rice - the usual.\nChinese sweet soup for dessert - poor....sugary, flavorless...left untouched.\n\nNew Jumbo is OK, not great but good for what it was. We had a little more than enough food for our family. It was a little over $200 including tip for 12 adults and 1 kid.The service was alright. Only gripe was that one of the seemingly clean bowls brought out for us wasn't exactly clean so I must dock them on that. \n\nI think my grandparents are already planning to return next month.

I would recommend many of their chef special. However, my first experience in this restaurant was terrible due to one of mid age lady (I think she might be part of owner) as she dressed up with casual without restaurant standard uniform as other servers. At first she tried to rush our order and we called out many dishes more than 9 for 5 people and we asked  her to repeat the order because we wanted to replace or remove one dish. She first acted she was in rush not willing to repeat and then convinced us to take all. We asked 3 times from different people and she still told us all order were good to keep (one of friend said let it be). We then let her go back to kitchen but we all really thought her response to our request was way out of line and inappropriate as a server. Although most of the food came out satisfactory as they are tasted, final bill was a bit surprised that one of steam fish price was 1.5 pound more than she quoted to us. This was $30 more. We would expect her to tell us too. At the end, we had to go back to pick up credit card as it was never given back to us when the receipt was signed. We did not catch it at that moment but it was sure the card was not attached in the binder as 3 people recall it was not there. We had to drive back to pick it up after half hour later. I guess I would suggest to watch that lady and hope someone read this review and remind her how to be a waitress and be much cautious to her rude manner.", "author": "Alto S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-02-17", "description": "This is my first time going to this restaurant so I am using Yan Yan Seafood Restaurant and Empero Taste as a reference benchmark since the prices are the same. This was on Monday, February 17, 2015 at 12PM with my mom. Typically when my mom and I got to any chinese restaurant for the first time, we will order two dishes to use as a reference point as listed below.  This restaurant had some people inside which was a good thing! ;)\n\nThe waiter was slow as they basically made the two of us share a table with another two persons who had been waiting for a small table.  The waiter only handed everyone the lunch specials menu but not the full menu.  Then the boss lady comes with one pot of tea, one pot of hot water and one small plate of spanish redskin peanuts as she did not realize there were two different tables at the big table.  Instead of offering to bring another tea, she tried to give us the hot water only and then she basically gave each of us half the peanuts.  The waiter did not know how to ask if we were ready for ordering until we had to flag him down so we ordered off the regular menu that was on printed on the take out menu that I looked at while waiting for the table.\n\nThere was complimentary free house soup which consists of dried vegetables and pork with lots of mini bones with lots of Monosodium Glutamate aka MSG in a soup sized bowl with enough for 1 refill for each person. \n\n1) Beef Chow Dried Chow Hor Fun or stir-fried flat wide noodles $7.50 - This dish was more expensive than either Yan Yan Seafood Restaurant and Empero Taste which were $7.00.  On the menu, it has a funny name called Old Classic Style Sir-fried Chow Hor so I asked the waiter if it was the same thing just to be certain I don't get something else all out of surprise.  It took 30 minutes for this dish to come out.  It was about 2/3rd the portion size of Yan Yan and Empero Taste.  There was not much beef.  The flavor was okay as it was cooked in lard since one can tell from the taste and how sticky it is.  The beef was heavily coated in sodium bicarbonate aka baking soda as they were basically making lower quality beef taste better than it is.  It does have what the chinese calls wok hei.\n\n2) Mandarin/Peking Spare Ribs $7.50 which are just a type of Sweet and Sour Pork Chops, this one is listed under the \"Good Food\" section in the take out menu, I wonder where is the \"Bad Food\" section as Capital (Peking) Beautiful Meat Spare Ribs, do they have a \"ugly\" version as well? ;)  When this dish came out which was another 20 minutes after the #1 above, it was 1/2 the size or slightly less of Yan Yan and Empero Taste as far as portion size goes at the same price.  Instead of big pieces of pork chops which is how other places serve it, they basically fried small pieces of pork chops in batter.  The flavor of the actual pork chops was okay but the sauce was a joke as it is basically canned sweet & sour sauce since it tastes exactly like the sweet & sour sauce one would get when eating Fried Won Ton at chinese restaurants catered to caucasians and not chinese.  \n\nSo after eating, it was already 1:15PM so we were trying to flag down the waiter to get the guest check.  It took 15 minutes before the waiter even recognizes us and another 5 minutes before he brought us the guest check which was roughly $16.00.  I took out the credit card and the waiter says no credit card under $25.  Now this one is funny because other than Chinatown restaurants which has a $20 minimum, all other places in the Sunset & Richmond districts has a minimum purchase of $5-$10.\n\nAt this point, instead of paying cash, I decided to order which took another 5 minutes for the waiter to come take the order:\n\n3) Honey Glazed Walnut Prawns $11.99 under the \"Good Foods\" section.  Another 20 minutes goes by and finally this comes out.  This order is basically 1/2 the size of Yan Yan and Empero Taste as I have seen other people had this at those restaurants which is about $12.50 over there.  There was exactly 12 medium sized prawns and about the same amount of half pieces in the small sized walnuts department.  The taste was not that good as the mayonnaise lack taste, the walnuts were not crunchy and seemed like it had lots of moisture in it which made it chewy.\n\nIn case you were wondering, the menu has the following sections:\n(A) Appetizers, (B) Healthy Soup, (C) Preferred Dishes, (D) Chef's Specialties,\n(E) Good Food, (F) Home Style Cooking, (G) Rice & Noodles, Beverage, Rice Plate.\n\nSo we had to flag them down for the new guest check and paid with credit card which took another 10 minutes.  There was no dessert which appears to be the normal these days at Chinese restaurants. Yan Yan does not provide free house soup during dinner but they always provide free marinated chicken feet for lunch and dinner with a unlimited quantity of desserts of which you can choose from 5 different options.  Empero Taste provides both free house soup & free dessert.  Service was really poor.", "author": "Vincent P."}

Clams were also fairly small and meatless. I'm pretty sure they made a bulk batch along with another table's order because we had some empty shells but no meat floating about at the bottom of the plate. Big bummer\n\nDau Miu(Snow Pea Sprouts) with Sea Cucumber - Was this even on the menu? I don't know, all I can say is that Dau Miu is one of my favorite veggies and I love it. However, I don't like sea cucumbers, so I can't speak for that. ( I don't like the mushy grossness of sea cucumbers in my mouth) \n\nBeef Brisket with Turnip Clay Pot - I personally wasn't a fan of it, but I think others didn't have a problem with it. \n\nFried prawns in sweet and sour sauce - The sauce tasted like ketchup (but i think they need to use that as the ingredients though, I'm not sure).

A lot of the dishes were huge, and we had a good amount of leftovers to take home. The food in general was ok - nothing outstanding but nothing horribly awful.\n\nAppetizer Combo - It's one of those plates with the jellyfish, pork shank, and sliced beef. I liked how they mixed pickled radishes, carrots, and cilantro with the pork shank. It was like a banh mi without the bread. The sliced beef was pretty tasty, too. I could taste the five spice used in the braising liquid, which made the beef tender and sweet. Jellyfish wasn't good, and was just bland. \n\nFish Maw and Sea Cucumber Soup - Pretty good. In addition to the sweet seafood flavors, there was a good amount of Jinhua Ham that added saltiness and umami. The soup was a little too starchy, but the flavor wasn't bad. \n\nBraised Fish Maw and Sea Cucumber - I don't think I've ever seen so much fish maw on one plate before. There was sooo much of it piled in the middle mixed with some sea cucumber, shiitake mushrooms, and other various edible fungi. Some of the fish maw was undercooked so it was a little more rubbery. The flavor was still ok. The mushrooms and fungi helped put the seafood flavor at the forefront. \n\nLobster with Supreme Broth - The lobster was cooked well. It was smooth with a firm bite but wasn't tough or too chewy. The sauce could've been seasoned better to bring out the lobster's flavor, but it was still decent. \n\nStir Fried Sticky Rice (Loh Mai Fan) - I really liked that there's a lot of goodies mixed in with the rice. It was packed with dried shrimp, Chinese cured bacon, and Chinese sausage. This gave the rice a lot of highlighting flavors, but the rice itself could've been more savory. Just a little more basic seasonings like soy sauce and sugar would've made the rice that much better. \n\nNew Jumbo works well as local neighborhood dinner spot.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-03-31", "description": "Very mediocre first experience. \n\nThe place was packed when I got there so I had some hopes of it being good. Parking is easy enough but if you come during prime dinner hours you most likely will have some trouble or have to park far away. \n\n- Soup of the day\n\nProbably the best thing we had all night, it was hot and flavorful and hit the spot. Strangely (but pleasantly) was still hot after our meal when we went back in for another bowl. \n\n- Beef spareribs w/ Bell peppers on a hot plate\n\nBesides the small show you get with this dish with the sizzling hot plate it comes out on, the taste left something to be desired. It was overly salty and thus impossible to eat without rice. The sparerib meat is fatty by nature and it did not mesh well with the glaze that the dish had...it's like when you add beans to a dish with potatoes...it has a similar texture and makes it weird to eat. \n\n- Pork neck meat sauteed with onions and peppers\n\nBland as all heck, and one of the pricier dishes on the menu. Waiter suckered my mom into getting this before I arrived. Never, ever listen to waiters when they recommend anything, it is almost always disappointing....this is yet another example.\n\n- Clams sauteed in black bean sauce\n\nClams were the smallest clams I've ever had. The meat was literally the size of my fingers we went through the dish instantly with minimal satisfaction. Taste was just right and probably the high point here. \n\n- Fried whole flounder\n\nThis thing took courage to eat because it came to us glistening. It was almost blinding how shiny this thing was, which meant it was drenched in oil and greasy as hell. Flounder by nature is quite bland but usually comes with a spicy black bean sauce for dipping/drizzling. This place just gives you soy sauce, which when dipped is awful. Don't know how this is even offered, as black bean sauce is not hard to make. We had to use the sauce from the clams for dipping here...until they took the dish away and we couldn't anymore. \n\nWe also had a veggie dish that I'm not 100% sure on how to translate to English, but it was bland and lacked flavor too. \n\nOverall most of our dishes were either overly flavored or lacked flavor. They just couldn't seem to get it right. Service was slow and almost non-existent throughout the night,...we were mostly ignored until someone came by and took our oyster dish which we were still using. which annoyed us. We asked for our check, and they brought out some boxes for us and some dessert. only to forget our check. Wow. We had to flag her down again to get it for us and it took another 5 minutes for her to come back to pick up our money. \n\nNot even close to my first choice for Chinese food in the city (or even the area), I'd like to say that I won't be back but feel like I probably will some time in the future.

Even after the management change, we'd go here as the upgrades were pretty good.  But something now makes us wonder if it's worth it.   They offer 3 dish specials for lunch.  They've always included steamed rice as a complimentary gesture.   We've seen many times the laborers and workers at lunch ask for extra rice and they've always complied.   At a table next to us were three elderly ladies who ordered several dishes but when they started packing up the leftovers, the waiter rushed over to take the rice away.  When the ladies asked for him to leave the rice as they wanted to take it with them, he said it was the policy to not allow people to take the complimentary rice with them.   The owner lady then came over and shouted out rudely that people were taking too much rice, she wasn't getting her money for it, so she was going to stop it by not allowing people to take the rice with them.  The ladies kept asking well if we can't take it, what are you going to do with it.?  You're not re-serving it to others, are you?  (Highly unsanitary). The owner quickly said no but she refused to say what they did with the uneaten rice.  \n\nThe whole incident makes me wonder if these people are so greedy and uncaring that they'd risk spreading unsanitary used rice and passing it off to the next diners.  \n\nYeah, I know this is a average Chinese joint in the Sunset so some of these practices are probably widespread but it saddens me to think that people on a tight budget like the elderly are treated like this.

There are mirrors on one side and pictures of Chinese characters on the other.  The floors are clean and laid with Pergo type oak.  The tables are covered with a cloth and topped with a series of paper place mats.  It seems that many of the tables are meant for large groups.  We came during lunch and many of the large tables were occupied by parties of two.\n\nThe service hasn't changed.  The serving staff is not very welcoming and are also not attentive.  They seemed harried and rushed people to their tables, but then took a long time before taking food orders..  A little better organization could rectify that.\n\nWe started off with some complimentary soup that did not look appetizing, though it did have a good flavor.  It consisted of chunks of bony and fatty meat with re-hyrdrated vegetables, and some sort of nuts.  We first tried to order dry sauteed string beans, but the waitress rushed off to the kitchen and said they were out.  We then order classic style beef chow fun ($6.50), Mongolian beef ($7.50), and bitter melon beef over rice ($5.50).  When the food came out, it looked very similar with this brownish gravy.  The beef seemed the same for each of the dishes.\n\nThe chow fun had a nice flavor and had chunks of bean sprouts.  The fun was thin and not stuck together.  The bitter melon was surprisingly good as it wasn't as tart as I expected.  The Mongolian beef had lots of onions, green onions, and peppers.\n\nThe chopsticks were made of plastic and food kept slipping off.  I always preferred wooden chopsticks.  No water was served or offered and there were no spices or other condiments on the table.  The waitress noticed that we were finished eating, but just ignored us until we asked for boxes and the check.  She then placed the check outside of our reach (we were sitting in one of the big round tables).\n\nCertainly lack of focus and caring of their customers is a trait of many restaurants like this.  They seem to prefer catering to only a certain type of clientele.  We didn't eat here much when it was the old Jumbo and unlikely to eat often at the new Jumbo.  We are still searching for the ideal value Chinese restaurant.", "author": "Robert J."}

The place is brighter and not as outdated as it used to be. I think they used to have carpet, but now have hardwood floors. I also heard the bathrooms are now both uni-sex where before there was one male and one female bathroom.\n\nFunny story - when my sister and I were kids, I had to use the restroom soo bad. Someone was using the women's for THE longest time. My sister told me to use the mens (which there was no wait). I told her no way 'cos I would never go into the men's for whatever reason. She would say it's the same, just go, she'll be outside waiting. I still didn't want to use it. We waited and waited, then finally, the door opened and this guy runs out!! I think he was more embarrassed than we were! Ah...poor guy. Well now the problem is solved!\n\nAnyway, came here with the grandparents and family. Requested no msg and no sodium. Food was still tasty. Ordered from the menu since it was cheaper. Got westlake soup (super yummy and my fav), sweet and sour chicken, seafood and veggies, ground pork over tofu for my toothless grandpa, white rice for my grandma, fried rice for everyone else, round eye steak with greens (very good), shrimp with candied walnuts (portion was little), fried fish...and we still got taro tapioca dessert!", "author": "Lori L."}

We had to wait about 15 min to get seated for a party of 2.  I was thinking 1) the food must be decent or 2) everyone is checking this place out since its under new management.  After eating I think it's the latter. \n\nWe ordered 4 dishes:\nFried Squab - dine in for $8.99 which is a good deal. Take out is 12.99.  It was pretty good - very meaty with a crispy skin. Only complaint- it was a bit too oily...you can tell its straight from the fryer and plated right away. \n\nClams with Blk bean sauce - dish was very bland and watery. Yuck!  Worst than the ones they serve at buffets!  The onions, pepper and ginger you see in the dish did not do anything to enhance the dish. Would not order it again.  \n\nSalt n Pepper Spareribs - this was disappointing too. Way too much batter! And the taste was a little off - not sure what it was..a little gamey maybe? The quality of the meat however was decent. Tender and just the right amount of fat. Yes I like my meat with a little fat in it! \n\nCucumbers soaked in black vinegar, garlic, chili pepper and sesame oil and topped with bits of black duck eggs.  This dish was good and refreshing. Would def order again if I come back.  However this dish don't require any cooking so they couldn't really mess it up.  \n\nService was slow as they were busy and pretty much non-existant. They show up to take your order and bring u the food. They never came back to check if we needed anything. I was in desparate need of an extra napkin but never got the chance to ask for one. And our dinner did not come with house soup. Boo!  But complimentary red bean dessert was served. Was also hoping they would have grand opening specials but nope!", "author": "Cathy M."}

Let's just start by saying I only came back for the food, not the service. Make sure you call in and reserve a table before coming. We didn't and group after group that \"insisted\" they had made reservations (in Cantonese) to the hostess were seated before us. We even wrote down our name on the sign-in sheet and the hostess did not look at it at all when seating people...after 3 parties were seated when they came in after us, I had to verbally tell the hostess how many people was in my party. Why is there even a sign-in sheet??! I would recommend having a Cantonese speaker if you want to be able to communicate with the hostess. She will start yelling at everyone in Cantonese when it gets busy, even when she's only taking orders from guests (Maybe that's just the way she talks?). I saw a big table of 10 wait 30 minutes before the hostess acknowledged them and finally took their order. 0 stars for her.\n\nThe kitchen staff is definitely shorthanded because 75% of the tables are just waiting for their food to come out.\n\n For our group of 7 people we ordered:\n\n-Crab Meat w/Fish Maw Soup: 4/5\n-Crab w/Salty Egg Told: 5/5\n-House Special Spareribs w/BBQ Sauce: 4/5\n-Famous Deep Fried Squab: 5/5\n-House Special Stir-fried Frog with Peanut: 4/5\n-Honey Glazed Walnut Prawns: 1/5\n-Sea Cucumber w/ Veggie & Abalone Sauce 4/5\n-Stir-Fried Chinese Watercress w/ Garlic 3/5\n\n\nAll of the seafood tastes fresh and delicious.

So, I just asked another waiter to replace it for me. The waitress was being really pushy and asked us to get the soup where some other big tables ordered, but we only had 4 people and the soup seemed good for 8-10. I would expect something better if they price at this level. \n\nThey should understand how competitive it is in their area.

The restaurant before served good old fashioned Cantonese food, though the consistency of the food wasn't great. The decor was pretty old, it felt run down every time I would walk in with friends or family. \n\nNOW, the restaurant has been cleaned up, there is a nice modern contemporary feeling to it and it feels very welcoming. I think the use of brighter lights and certain coats of paint is what makes this restaurant look vibrant. My family and I felt very comfortable while we ate dinner and chatted while waiting for our food to come out.  I came here with my elderly folks and we ordered a variety of dishes that accommodated our Chinese food palates. Delicious!\n\nFOOD: \nWe ordered the Dry Tangerine Peel Stewed Duck soup, Deep Fried garlic chicken wings, Steamed Oysters, Braised Lamb with mushrooms, dry fried string beans and salted fish meat loaf; I know it as gee yurk bee-ang.. Food was yummy yummy in my tummy! \n\nSERVICE: \nThe wait staff were friendly, jovial, bi-lingual; yes, they do speak English too, and accommodating to our needs. For example, food allergies and salt content.\n\nOVERALL EXPERIENCE: \nI would definitely come back with my family and friends for dinner since the restaurant is in the comfort of my neighborhood. Parking is around the neighborhood is decent if you don't mind walking 3-4 blocks to your car. The food is well worth it. Portions weren't totally huge, but it was enough for a group of five of us. The variety of Chinese food is geared toward the local Chinese population, but also accommodates the non Chinese person as well. \n\nHowever, my only complaint would be the price of food here, it has definitely risen since the previous \"Jumbo Seafood Restaurant\" had their $5 specialty menu. I was used to paying for 8-10 deep fried chicken wings or a pound and a half of boiled shrimp w/ sauce for $5!

There were big tables open and still people had to wait in line. I know you want to save the big tables for big parties, but it was already pretty late. \n\nWhen we first walked in, we weren't greeted by anyone. Everyone there was super busy even though the restaurant seems to only have a few tables with customers. We were standing and we were asked 3 times how many people were in our party. Failed. \n\nOnce we sat down, we looked through the menu and ordered 3 things: XO sauce seafood fried rice, Classic style beef chow fun, and Egg with beef over rice. Usually the order of events is-- get seated, tea, get your order, give you soup, then your food comes. Here? Seated, got your order, you had to ask for your own tea, food comes, you asked for your own soup. So let me review the food-- seafood fried rice was good, but definitely did not notice any XO sauce. Egg with beef over rice, not enough salt. What got us mad was the beef chow fun. My mom saw another table and noticed theirs definitely look good. She knows her beef chow fun-- the dark soy sauce tells you whether or not it's good. Ours? super light and not even the same type of chow fun. When we asked the waiter, he said, you ordered the \"classic style\", not the regular one. I looked at the menu and there wasn't the \"regular one\". When my mom walked out after paying, she had to ask the owner, she said that's the same thing, so my mom told her about our plate(you know how chinese ladies are-- complain, complain, complain). But she was right! The owner took out a $5 bill and gave it to my mom. We don't want your money lady, we just want good food! Maybe you should start making some discount cards where you can give to regulars and people that got you aware of your new restaurant. One last thing about the food, one table sat down and wanted to order appetizers. The lady asked for potstickers, waiter said sorry we don't have it. Ok, well can we have the egg roll? Waiter once again said, don't have it. If you don't have it on grand opening days, why do you put it on the menu? \n\nI need to talk about the service, oh boy was it a JOKE! We sat down and noticed the kitchen was very slow. The workers are so confused about everything! They never bring you soup, only when you ask. Their order of food came out all wrong! the same dish that 2 tables ordered went to the table that just ordered while the older tables had to wait for another 15 minutes. Next, they didn't know who ordered what and was running around the restaurant trying to get the right dish to the right customer. We got 3 plates put down on our table that's not ours. The owner also yelled at a waiter for bringing soap to a table! She said hes not supposed to bring any soup, his role was to set up tables and clean up tables-- but tables needed their stuff and so he offered to help. That-- he got yelled at. At some point, I wanted to walk up and help the waiters/waitresses.\n\nI know they're new, but the place wasn't busy and already ran into so many problems!

There must have been a massive influx of new Asian immigrants into the Sunset District in the last few years because I thought I knew everyone in the Sunset and I did not see one familiar face this time. This place is under new management and seems to cater to big groups of mostly Cantonese-speaking extended families. The menu is intimidating and confusing to those who have not been to Hong Kong or Guangzhou where the decor, ambiance and service at an eatery has no correlation with the prices they charge. This place is pricey despite the crowded, loud, no-frills, bright fluorescent light, third world atmosphere but it still attracts big crowds because they offer value for those familiar with the more expensive Cantonese delicacies like braised abalone with goose web feet, squab, sea cucumber, Geo Duck Clam and big earthen crocks of traditional double-steamed herbal tonic soups simmered for hours from exotic things like freshly-slaughtered sea turtle, Cordyceps & Conch that are supposed to heal all that ails you. Each one of these ala-carte dishes has a price tag of $15 to $38. Most of their live fish & seafood is priced by the pound and prices fluctuate seasonally. It is killed to order in true Cantonese-style, so a single steamed fish dish may run as high as $300. So if you are looking for cheap Chinese food, this is definitely not the place and if you think Chinese food is cheap, think again. The clientele here seems to consist mainly of newly-minted, multi-millionaires from China who recently bought their way into the U.S so dropping a few hundred or even a thousand U.S dollars on dinner every night is no object as long as the restaurant has enough dishes to keep it interesting. The management seems to have been so spoiled by these cash-paying, big-spending hordes that they treat those of us who order under $50 worth of food and try to pay with a credit card like red-headed step-children. The lady at the front actually told me their new credit card machine only accepts the new credit cards with a chip in it and since my card does not have a chip in it, I would need to pay cash. I used to sell merchant credit card accounts and I had never heard of this before so I decided to call VISA and found out she was full of shit and most likely,this was a ploy to keep the profits off the books. Needless to say, it backfired on her because I gave her all the cash I had and I was actually short a buck.", "author": "John T."}

You would think any restaurant owner that they do this after restaurant hours because nobody in the right mind want to see what's in the kitchen being taken out if just down right tasteless.", "author": "J H."}

Pretty standard, but I love it anyway!", "author": "Laura H."}

They always have tables reserved which are always empty. It gets crowded easily so I would write my name on the sign in sheet. The problem is they don't follow the order and table only people who has more people in their group. After a half hour wait, being on the top of the list, without even a word from them letting me know of I'll even get a seat, I left. I've had it here, I could have gone to any other restaurant in the area and gotten a seat and food on the table with the time it took waiting to be seated there. Don't go here if you expect to get a quick table and food. And this happened to me on multiple occasions!! As I was walking out I noticed the reserved seats which has been there longer than I had, still empty, just as their customer service. Their food is at best average and not worth the long wait. Save yourself some money and majority of your time by going somewhere else..", "author": "Chris K."}

When we arrived on a Friday evening around 6 pm only to find 4 tables of people. My wife thought the restaurant would be busier in about a 1/2 hour. The waite staff seem be be slowly bringing out food. The person that appeared to be the owner of the restaurant seemed to be just standing around. Took 10 minutes for someone to take our order. Around this time, a guy with two small children was seated next to our table. The owner seemed to \"spring alive\". She quickly gave him a menu and food was on his table in no time. Obviously he knew the owner.... \n\nThe prices seem to be a bit on the high side. We ordered shrimp with scallops with greens... tasteless... jelly fish appetizer was good. Clam and black bean sauce seem to have more empty clam shells than meat. Perhaps I was not looking hard enough. Sweet tapioca drink for dessert. Heavy on the corn starch. Could have stood a spoon in the middle of the bowl. \n\nBottom Line: Great place to go if you like to pay high prices for mediocre food and to check out the great model job. As we left the restaurant, we noiced the Chinese restaurant next door was full of diners. Wonder why....", "author": "M N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-03-06", "description": "This place probably started new ownership about 2 years ago.  Since we saw that grand opening sign, we'd been going there a lot.  The food was great and very authentic Chinese and varied.  The lunch is particularly awesome with the choices and the bargain price of $21 with 3 entrees, a nice soup and free rice.  I would've given it 5 stars before.\n\nSadly, we've seen the waiter/waitresses' attitude/service quickly deteriorate about a year after its opening.  It was probably because they got so busy with the ever increasing business that the servers became very grumpy.  That bothered us but we continued to go for another year or so because the food was good and prices were reasonable.  \n\nThe last time we went there was two months ago and we decided not to go back.  We brought some friends for dinner and the waitress was grumpy and rude (as she had been for a while) and kept selling us the $30 expensive soups.  That wasn't the first time we saw the waitresses doing that when we had friends with us.  They probably thought we couldn't say no when we're entertaining friends as it'd look like we're being stingy.  That time I decided to refuse all those rip-off expensive soups the waitress proposed one after another.  I told her it's too much for a soup and she proposed another and another--I couldn't believe it.  And she was very grumpy.  In the end, the dinner cost $150 for 7 people (including a few kids), but we once or twice had a table for 8 and it used to cost just about $100.  Even though $150 was not excessive, their dinner entrees had certainly shrunk in size (and quality) and the service had become unbearable.\n\nThe other reason I decided to stop going there is because I suspect the restaurant has a cockroach problem.  When I was there once getting a lunch take-out order, I overheard the owner saying to the waitresses that they had to do something to \"control/stop/prevent\" (that's my best translation from what they said in Cantonese) cockroaches that night...", "author": "Linda A."}

This is mainly based on the mediocre food and the horrible service. As my group of 3 was walking in, we were semi acknowledged by a waiter playing on his phone. Reluctantly he asked how many people were dining. First impression of the decor was nice, floors were new along with mirror adorned walls and wood flooring that was creatively used as a wall base. The waiter grabbed 2 menus and sat us right next to the only other diners who were in the restaurant. All cramped up we decided to just move to a table a bit further away from the other party. Seemingly a strike one in the waiters book. He was annoyed we could all tell. We sat and looked over the old greasy menu and waited for him to come back to take our order. My group ordered a  squab, walnut shrimp, some seafood noodles, and a string bean with fish fillet dish. The squab was the first to come out, it was absolutely delicious, perfectly crispy and flavorful. The next was the walnut shrimp. That's where it all went wrong. The dish came after the kitchen bell rang, a female waitress came out and delivered out table the plate, as soon as she set it down I looked at it and automatically was disgusted. There was a long wavy hair that was mixed into the shrimp. Automatically called her back and even she seemed as if she didn't have her vision all in check as we told her there was a hair in it and she just stood there attempting to see it. When she finally did, she had a shocked and annoyed look on her face and took it back into the kitchen. My table and I were worried that she would just take it back into the kitchen, pick out the hair and bring it back so we called over the waiter who took our order to cancel the dish, he was even more annoyed.  We then asked to order another squab and he seemingly nodded, like he acknowledged our request and put the order in. Our filet and string bean stir fry dish as well as the seafood noodles came and we just about finished the dishes as we were still patiently waiting for the squab. It never came.. We asked the waiter if he did put in the order and he said no, rudely and had the nerve to say to us that we never said anything about ordering it. We then just asked for the check, he was extremely rude about it. One of the worst dining experiences I've had. Crap service, under staffed and rude. Never plan to come here again.", "author": "Michelle C."}

That is the cold feeling you will get from their head waitress and co-owner.   For a party of 10, we order a mix of their expensive dishes and budget conscious dishes, like their Squab special.  We ordered three squabs since each squab is cut into 4 pieces  so everyone would get a quarter piece (note they are small unlike other restaurants that can cut them into 6 pcs.).  Well, the waitress/owner was not happy.  She gave us a dirty look and it went all down hill from there.  She continued to ignore us the entire evening.   When the squab came, she brought only two out of three and grunted, \"I owe you one more\".  The next one took 20 more minutes to come while we see other tables served with squabs.     Asked for water - looked at us and walked away.  Asked for the rice we ordered - looked at us and walked away.   We spend over $180 for a party of 10 and treated like beggars.  Who do they think they are?  The place looked like a cafeteria, tight, and not very clean.   You are not welcome unless she feels you are worthy to eat there.  I wish the restaurant next to them upgrade their food and put this Sh*t hole out of business. Then maybe she will put a fake smile back on her Sh*t face.", "author": "Henry L."}

Despite having made a reservation and the place being nearly empty when we walked in, the lady at the front gave us a seat nearest to the restroom. Seeing that there were so many other tables empty, we asked for a seat away from the smell of the toilet. She frowned at us and said this table was right for the number of people we had when I clearly saw many other tables of the same size. I asked persistently for a better table so I got one but I wouldn't have known this would be the start. We were waiting on one of our friends and the lady started yelling at us that we didn't have the exact number of people as we reserved. Dirty looks continued. I am never coming again to this place.

The only plus side was we got a free bowl of salted peanuts and free tea... at the cost of a 60 minutes of our lives staring listlessly at the Jumbo employees as hope of service steadily dwindled away. We waited without even a greeting  - all they say is \"Wait.  Can't you see it's busy?\" in a disdainful tone that's bad even for a Chinese place.  Each of 4 waiters PLUS the manager have the bad habit of actively avoiding eye contact so that they don't have to talk to you again. Looked at the table left of us, two customers were sleeping. Looked to the right, old Asian ladies loudly complaining that it's been an hour and only one dish has come out. It's not even the chef's fault - Jumbo people are just slow and inefficient [I was so bored I began watching them and noticed that their waiters need both hands to hold one dish from kitchen to table and STILL spilling stuff... I'm used to waiters doing near-circus level balancing acts at other places]. I'm not a sucker - I made an executive decision to get out of this death trap, checked next door for another option and there was, and coaxed my overly nice family out. Ended up going to New Hing Lung and one guy [the manager] was overseeing the ground floor BY HIMSELF competently, the food began coming out within ten minutes, and my family left full and satisfied.
