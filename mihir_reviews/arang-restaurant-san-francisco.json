Food was decent but not the best. They do give bon chon but it didn't taste as \"authentic\" or fresh as other places. The potato salad tasted like it was from Safeway. \nFor our food we ordered the Kimchee pancakes, kimchee fried rice, and the soft tofu soup. The pancakes looked amazing! They tasted good but a little too heavy on the onions in my opinion. The kimchee fries rice wasn't that great. Kinda bland and felt like the ingredients weren't cooked or blended well together. My favorite was the soup. It was a cold-walk from the concert venue to the restaurant, so the soup really hit the spot! Great flavor and tofu was nice and soft.\nGood for a late night snack, especially if you are around the Filmore. Not too many options at night other than Subway.", "author": "Christian N."}

Their sides weren't too good besides their seaweed. I love how they have barley tea as a given and of course tbeee small sides with our meal.

Pork Plate: Spicy, Grilled thin-sliced pork marinated in a spicy sauce ($16.95)\n77. Bibim Neng Myon: Spicy, Cold buckwheat noodles mixed with hot sauce ($11.95)\n82. Bone Soup with Potato: Spicy, Pork ribs and potato stewed with mixed vegetables in spicy sauce ($15.95 for one serving)\n\nI ordered the kalbi. The meat had great flavor. Smokey, savory, with a hint of sweetness. The pork was okay. It wasn't spicy at all and I thought it was a little mushy. The cold noodles were okay, but overly sauced. And I love sauce. The roommate added some soup to thin it out, but it was still too saucy. The soup was okay. Not much complexity in flavors. It just tasted mostly like bean paste.\n\nOther than the galbi, everything else was just okay.

And instead of giving us the normal portion of meat, the cook gave us a larger portion of meat and was extremely apologetic for his mistake. As upset as we were, the cook's apology and make up gesture actually made us very happy. When we got home we enjoyed our meal and felt really good about it :) \n\n\n\nMy usual here is the stir fried kimchi pork and tofu, military soup and kimchi fried rice with no corn. The kimchi fried rice is really good, but their portion is pretty small :/ The sea bass soup is pretty decent as well, a lot of flavor and not too fishy. The great part about this restaurant is that they're open til 2am everyday!\n \nThis is a good place to grab some good Korean food if your ever in Jtown!", "author": "Amanda R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-03-14", "description": "This review is for a takeout order of kimchi fried rice and japchae. \n\nBefore moving away from SF, I frequented Arang regularly because of their phenomenal kimchi fried rice. It was spicy with a strong kimchi flavor and generous amounts of meat. Over the past few years, during visits, I still went to Arang for the kimchi fried rice. \n\nI am sad to report that I picked up two orders of kimchi fried rice yesterday, and both orders were underwhelming. In fact, I could barely taste the kimchi and it was not spicy at all. I also ordered japchae, which was lacking in flavor. I don't know if they changed recipes, or chefs, but the kimchi fried rice of recent is nowhere as good as it used to be. \n\nTwo stars for easy phone ordering and friendly staff (as usual).", "author": "Cora L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-10-25", "description": "Arang has this home-y vibe of being tucked away on the corner. You really feel like you're away from the outside world since you can't really see the door from the tables and I think the windows are all covered up if there are even any. Maybe that would be bad if you were claustrophobic... but to me, it feels just like being back in Korea where most of the restaurants are sometimes tucked underground and away from the noise of the outside streets.\n\nWe got the back booth as a group of 5 on a Friday night. The server was really courteous and understanding when we needed more time to decide. You get barley tea and a small tray of side dishes. In the background, they are playing a mix of recent K-pop songs and Top 40 mainstream. \n\nFood here is amazing! I'm so happy that the food hasn't changed and possibly, may have gotten even better? It's been awhile so I can't remember but I also ordered new dishes this time.\n\nKIMCHI FRIED RICE - 3.5/5 Delicious but pretty standard. Came with a fried egg on top and the spam is really addicting. Wasn't super spicy so there wasn't really a strong kimchi taste but I enjoyed it since it was flavorful and I just love spam. \n\nBBQ PORK BULGOGI BENTO - 4/5 I was supposed to order the plate but I think I accidentally pointed to a bento. But the bento came with a decent amount of pork so it was all good. There was also 2 fried dumplings, salad and white rice as well as these potato tasting strips. Pork was really good and not overcooked or overly spicy. \n\nFRIED CHICKEN WITH SPICY SAUCE - 5/5 I don't know the actual name since we just referred to the picture hanging in the front but this was amazing Korean fried chicken. If only we had some beer to go along with it for chimaek. The chicken was tender and the breading was done so well. It was nice and crispy and just melted in my mouth. The spicy sauce was sooooooo good. I thought SanTung was my favorite for chicken wings but I was wrong. It's Arang. The chicken is also really meaty so you get big pieces! Not some dingy tiny little chicken wing. I think there were about ten pieces given that five of us each ate two wings.\n\nSLICED RICE CAKE STEW - 4/5 We thought it was going to be spicy for some reason but it wasn't... or maybe it was and we couldn't tell since we were using our bowls that had the spicy chicken. It was a white broth and it tasted a bit like seaweed/sesame. I thought it was a nice contrast to all the spicy foods we had earlier. The rice cake was nice and soft but what I really enjoyed was the broth. This may be a good hangover stew. \n\nOverall, it was a great meal and food + ambiance + service were all around excellent. Prices are around $10-13 for dinner which I find average for Korean food in SF (actually quite cheap since some places can go up to $15...)", "author": "Diana C."}

Well, except that it's better since they have Korean food and they play K-pop (makes it taste that much more authentic!), but you get my drift.\n\nThe menu is extensive, filled with the usual staples (bibimbap, BBQ meat platters, haemul pajun/seafood pancake, soups/stews), along side a number of more unique dishes and a handful of Japanese items (oddly enough).  Of the things I've tried though, my favorite of the bunch is easily their Kimchee and Sausage Jeongol - meat and ramen stew/casserole.  Although they don't do it as well as my favorite place in Oakland (sahn Maru), it's plenty good regardless.  Loaded with ramen noodles, spam, hot dog, sliced rice cake, and kimchee in a spicy kimchee soup, we're talking about a whole lotta goodness going on.  Granted, it's on the salty side like how most Korean soups/stews are, but it packs a ton of flavor and spice.  The best part is that you can order an individual portion in a bowl, or go with a large pot of it that sits on a burner for the table to share.  Woohoo!\n\nBeyond that, the other dishes I've tried have all been pretty decent.  One of my friends likes their kimchee fried rice, and their japchae and haemul pajun are good.  The BBQ meats are solid and will hit the spot if you have a craving, but they obviously can't compare to actual Korean BBQ joints.  Their ban chan offerings, on the other hand, leave a bit to be desired.  They only offer four or five for the table, and even then the taste is just \"meh\" (at least the kimchee still tastes okay).  \n\nAlso, one last note that's not really specific to Arang, but about the parking lot for the complex - be VERY careful about how long you leave your car there for.  Make sure you check the signs for the posted limit because the Safeway/property manager will tow your car, especially if there are events going on at the Fillmore or Yoshi's.

It's pretty hard to get a seat here at lunch, surprisingly. I wish they'd just drop the \"Japanese\" part of their menu--they're removed enough from Japantown proper that I don't feel like they need it. Service is good--there used to be a super nice lady who worked there who was very attentive, but she disappeared all of a sudden a little over a year ago. \n\nAnyways, on to the food. Our standard was a spicy pork or spicy chicken plate and a labokgi (ramen with rice cakes in spicy sauce). Alternatively the kimchi pancakes and soondubu were okay. Soju cocktail is reasonable as well. \n\nI would say don't go for the bone soups because they're honestly pretty bland. \n\nSadly before we moved away the quality seemed to go down a bit--rice cakes would get overcooked..sauce wasn't spicy enough..but fingers crossed next time we go back for nostalgia they'll be back to normal.", "author": "Vivian C."}

If you aren't a big eater then you should share this. Comes with gyoza (small but tasty), salad (doesn't feel Korean to me and eh), shredded potato (overly salty), vermicelli noodles (not bad).

My brother and I were midway through our meal when my mom joined us and ordered her food. I also notice couple people coming in and asking the waiter if they can seat 8 people in about 30 minutes or so. Anyways, while my mom is clearly still eating, he comes by and tells us that we have about 5- 10 minutes to finish our food. He proceeds to say its because he has 8 people to seat soon (actually in a pretty rude standoff-ish tone), but I answered back ..\"she's not even halfway done with her food..\" He then says, \"I know, thats why I gave you 10 minutes. I think that's plenty.\" I asked \"so ..you're telling us to leave while we're still eating... are we not customers ourselves?.... that's odd. \" \n\nhe had nothing to say and turned back around, but obviously that interaction made me not wanna be there - also making my mom rush through her meal which was so unnecessary. \n\nIt's fine when the restaurant gets too crowded and we're DONE eating to come ask us to possibly take off. As considerate people, we'd get up quickly and get going if that was the situation. \n\nI just think it's so rude to ask a customer to finish ASAP when they're mid-eating... - aren't those basics? my mom already eats pretty quick, don't rush her.  just sayin.", "author": "Dina K."}

We were all so frikken hungry that it didn't really matter where or what we ate. Luckily, we saw a korean restaurant, so that was pretty awesome (I love korean food). \n\nIt was nice and homey inside the restaurant and the workers were really accommodating to all 10 of us. We were served some sesame tea which wasn't too bad--- tastes like Rice Krispies tea. \n\nGood thing they weren't that busy so our orders came out pretty fast even though there were so many of us, but since we were all coupled up, most of our party kind of shared, but not I! Hahha. I ordered the (cold) bibimbap which was good. In my opinion, all (cold) bibimbaps taste the same no matter what restaurant I go to (could be different in Korea, who knows). I just added some hot sauce and I was good to go. I enjoyed my meal very much.\n\nIt wasn't the best korean restaurant I've been to and it wasn't the worst, so I would come back if I was in the area and if I was hungry late at night.", "author": "Jorgess M."}

One of our friends used to live in Filmore, they knew what restaurants were actually good. Considering how packed everything was, having a server say that the wait was only 30 minutes was great.\n\nIn the end, the three of us waited for about 45 minutes and there's the place is super small so I'm okay with the wait. However, things from there went downhill. First of all, the service there was horrible. We barely has our server come by wnough to get her attention that we were ready to order. Plus, the table wasn't properly cleaned so sauce dripped onto my friend's jeans. Then we had to move tables because apparently the servers cannot figure out how six people can be seated at a table of four.\n\nNow onto the food itself. How come there was no banchan? I've never gone to one Korean restuarant and had no banchan. I've lways at least had 2 banchan served before my meal and this place is not one of those fusion places where you could look over it. Plus, there was no red chili paste to put with my food. Considering how they didn't really season my food, they should have offered that. The wait for our food was short, but that probably had to do with the quality of the food. I got dol sot bibimbap. The stone could have been hotter since my rice didn't get crispy towards the end. The egg was at the right consistency and they put all the usual vegetables. It was an okay dol sot bibimbap, but nothing that would draw be back to going there.\n\nFor the price I paid, I was expected a little more for my buck since I've paid the same amount for the same thing in San Jose.

It was difficult to find anything else in the soup (aka meat) since everything was tofu lol The broth was a bit spicy but tasted good and they give you a side of rice.

Fortunately, Arang does all the grillin' in back so that you can sit back and enjoy your meal and company.\n\nI've been to Arang several times.  The menu features your typical Korean dishes...Bi Bim Bop (stone pot rice), Bulgogi (marinated beef), Galbi (marinated beef short ribs), and even other non-Korean items like Tempura.  And of course, your meal is complemented with Banchan (Korean side dishes)\n\nBut what you NEED to order is the meat casserole!  Everytime I'm feeling a little down, this pot of goodness provides me with a quick pick-me-up.  They bring out a propane burner and a pot full of deliciousness.  Think kim-chee tofu soup.  But instead of kim-chee and tofu, the caserole contains slices of spam and hot dogs (sounds random...but I promise it's delicious), ramen noodles, and rice cakes.

Maybe I DO have a couple of years before I officially become 'Cougar Status'!\"\n\nLast night's dinner at Arang was like a trip down memory lane for me. In the early 2000s, this was the \"spot\" to come for underage drinking before/after karaoke. Past forward 10 years, it's good to know that they NOW check IDs b/c I absolutely do NOT condone underage drinking *eyes staring at the ceiling*. \n\nMy friends and I came to here at about 9:30 PM for a post-movie dinner/drinking. A table of four had just left, so we were promptly seated.\n\nFOOD/DRINKS:\n*Peach Soju (Pitcher - $24): It was ok. We used this to chase down the Chamisul.  The peach taste came from peach syrup from a can and not juice as it was a bit syrupy, sweet, and an odd yellow/orange color. If you like fruit sojus made w/ real fruit juice, check out the \"The Spot\" or \"Toyose\" in the Sunset. \n\n*Yogurt Soju (Small - $6): Better than the peach soju. It was creamy, sweet, and tart with a slight hint of alki flavor. \n\n*Chamisul (375 ml - $9.95): It was GOOD! The filtered sake was clean and refreshing. \n\n*Soondubuchigae (Tofu Soup - $8.95): I didn't have any, so I can't account for the taste.\n\n*Tteokbokki (Korean Rice Sticks -$9.95): Meh! The cylinder rice sticks were boiled and then stir-fried in gochujang (chili and fermented soybean) sauce. Because the rice sticks are very glutinous and wasn't cooked thoroughly, it was like chewing on stale gum. \n\n*Kalbi (BBQ Beef Shortribs - $16.95): YUMMY! The short ribs were perfectly cooked and were fatty, tender, and very flavorful from the soy, ginger, garlic, brown sugar, and sesame marinade. \n\n*Stir-fried Soon-dae (Korean Sausage - $12.95): Eck! This looked nothing as pictured on the menu nor on Yelp which displayed slices of fried sausages. What we received was sausages mixed with jap chae (vermicilli) and gochujang. Soon-dae is made of pig's intestines and stuffed with a mixture of pig's blood, rice, green onions, garlic, minced pork, and vermicelli. It's definitely an acquired taste. Because it's steamed first, it's has a mushy texture and an irony after taste. The jap chae was overcooked and soaking in the gochujang sauce. \n\n*Spam and Sausage Jeongol (Casserole - $22.95): YUMMY! Essentially, you get a big pot of kimchee soup filled with sliced rice cakes, kimchee, SPAM, hotdogs (not the soon-dae), green onions, topped with a block of raw ramen. After letting everything simmer on your table for 5 minutes, mix everything and you have a stew-like concoction. If you like kimchee tofu soup, ramen, and most importantly SPAM, you will LOVE this dish! The soup was rich, savory, and super spicy. And, the other ingredients depend on the cooking time, cook it shorter if you want al-dene ramen and rice cakes and longer if not. \n\n*Kimchee Fried Rice ($7.95): YUMMY! Spicy al-dente rice w/ cubes of spam and an egg over easy with a runny yolk....may I need to say more? I don't think so...\n\n*Bingsu (Korean Shaved Ice - $4.95): YUMMY! The shaved ice is topped with vanilla ice cream, red beans, bananas AND cinnamon toast crunch! It's basically a Korean version of Halo-halo. It's had a good combo of texture combos: cold, creamy, rich, sweet, and crunchy. This is a definite MUST order to cool down your tongue after devouring all the spicy dishes!\n\nSERVICE: \nFor an Asian restaurant, I thought it was pretty damn good. The waitress was very nice and friendly. She took our orders promptly, we got ALL of our food within 15 minutes, and she came to check on us every so often.\n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR:\nHasn't changed a bit from the last time I went in 2001. They still have the same neon sign inside and out, bamboo plants, and hanging bubble lights. The dining area to the left has 4 tables that sits 4 people each and there's 3-4 booths on the right side that sits 4 people each. \n\nPARKING:\nArang is conveniently located in The Fillmore Shopping Plaza (Safeway, Popeyes) across from Panda Express and next to Subway, so you can park in the lot. \n\nAlthough some of their items were a Hit OR Miss, Arang's pricing and service has an edge over other Korean restaurant; e.g. Won Mi charges $25.95 for Kalbi while Arang charges just $16.95. So, if you're having a late night craving for Korean Food (closes at 2 AM everyday) and don't feel like dropping $$$, Arang is definitely a place to check out esp for their bento boxes under $10 which comes with a meat of your choice, jap chae, gyoza, rice, and salad!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Service is hit and miss: sometimes you have good service and sometimes you have bad service. Food here, however, is delicious! The best time to come is during their lunch hours. Their prices for their lunch menu are unbeatable for the large amount of food you get. You basically get full dinner portions for the lunch items. Their dinner menu basically has the same items as the lunch menu with more entrees but dinner is more pricey than the lunch items.They have the best tofu soup, and seafood bibambap (rice with mixed veggies and seafood in a hot stoneware bowl) in SF. Their seafood pancake is also something you should try! And see if you can get it cooked with Kimchi (only certain servers know you can add kimchi to the pancake to make it a seafood kimchi pancake). They have a variety of non-spicy dishes too for those who cannot handle the heat. They serve lots of banchan (korean side condiment dishes), and these are refillable. You just have to ask the servers to do it. Their entrees are big enough for two people to share. They also serve you green tea with toasted glutinous rice on top. They also have regular sodas, and soju (alcoholic korean mixed cocktails)! You can buy the soju in pitchers.\n\nThey play korean pop music at night, and an american light rock music station during the day time. \n\nThere is parking on the street, and some people even park in the Safeway parking lot since the restaurant is located in the same plaza area. However do this with caution! I been told that some cars actually do get towed away for parking in the Safeway parking lot!\n\nOther than hit and miss service, and the parking, I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to try authentic Korean dishes.", "author": "Elaine W."}

Box includes all that I listed above but plate gives you more of the meat that you order with rice but excluding all that I listed earlier and plate is more expensive.

Unfortunately, I did not bother to do my research and when I skimmed through Arang's menu choices, I defaulted to my usual Japanese favorite, Salmon Teriyaki.  When deciding between a box or plate, I chose the plate, thinking there would be less extra side items (which I usually waste), and went for the plate.  Turned out the plate was all Salmon in Teriyaki sauce with a few onion slivers along the sides.  The small bowl of rice was on the side along with a plate of some other side items.  \n\nThe salmon itself was okay, but a tad on the dry side.  The warm sake was presented in a little jug with two tiny tea cups.  \n\nThe service seemed to favor the right side of the dining room as we found it difficult to get the attention of our waitress as she spent a lot of time over there.", "author": "Carol Y."}

Otherwise the only other option would have been Won Mi which would have been more than fine. Wow... in hindsight that was big mistake to eat here. \n\nFirst of all, when we stepped into the restaurant we were told to wait 15 minutes, even though there were at least 10 open tables and the whole restaurant holds maybe 20 tables in total. Then I realized it must because they were understaffed, so we sort of shifted our way towards a booth and sat down in one that still hadn't been cleaned yet, and watched some basketball being played on the big screen TV. At this point, while sitting around in a dirty booth we also became aware that everyone who was sitting down around us was drinking and playing drinking games at their table, with food being ordered as well, but not as the focus. We also started feeling very cold, perhaps it was the hunger and the long drive, but then the high ceilings, corner location facing wind, and lack of heat in the restaurant were very apparent. By the time I walked back to my car to get everyone's ski jacket the table had finally been cleaned and we ordered a few dishes with no alcohol. \n\nThey did not even have the normal BBQ chicken that I usually order but some Asian fusion orange chicken hybrid, Kalbi, and seafood pancake so we ordered that. The food finally came out some time later, and everything was totally forgettable... the chicken tasted a bit strange, sort of like a grilled version of something I would expect to find at Panda Express. The Kalbi was cut LA style which always reminds me of a lunchtime rice plate rather than a dinner style cut, and the seafood pancake was overfried and dripping with excess oil. \n\nWe ate our meal in silence with regret that we had rushed back only to have NOT eaten at Won Mi across the street. Well, let's just say I won't ever be making that mistake again when faced with these 2 choices. In my mind Arang is more like a bar you can come to enjoy some big screen TV action and drinking games with your friends, just don't come for the food.", "author": "Mark Y."}

Furthermore, it takes a lot to get their attention while my friend had to constantly ask the server to come over to get us more water, utensils, menus, and etc. The worst part was that they overcharged me and my friends for what we had order, since we asked for separate checks we didn't know that they included tips already when we were paying, therefore we payed extra tips.

It's around the corner from a Subway Hut a little ways along some open space. Very small storefront where the door is.  I'm a fan of everything Korean (I'm Chinese). Discovered a Korean dessert called Patbingsu which is really good. I think Arang is the only restaurant in SF that has it (at least mentioned on Yelp). Found 2 places in Santa Clara and 1 in San Mateo. I started off with dinner. I had the Soft Tofu Soup. It was only $9.95 and was decent size. Not the smallest or biggest I've ever had. This place has Japanese and Korean food and lunch specials. Have to try the Fried Chicken tossed with Spicy Korean BBQ sauce (I've made it myself before. It's less messy to have someone else make it). I'm going to have to try other dishes. Prices are reasonable. Saw another table that had this relatively large metal bowl over a portable stove that had noodles, spam, sausage, vegetables in a spicy broth. Have to try that next time. Ordered my Patbingsu. Took only about 5 minutes for them to bring it out. It was sized for one. Had ice shavings, red beans, corn chex flakes, fruit cocktail, a little ice cream and thinly sliced banana. I finished the whole thing. Only $5.95. I forgot to take a pic of my food. Next time. Service was decent. No issues. I'll write another review after I've tried a few more dishes.\n\nAtmosphere in the place was nice. Only had about 8 tables in the place. So probably not good for groups.

Prices are decent for the food, the soju is a different story. But starting off with the food, my friend and I split the Kimchi Fried rice, and the Spicy Tofu Soup. The tofu soup was delicious, so was the kimchi fried rice but I wasn't a fan of the corn bits in the rice. You get of course as with any other korean mean, ban chan. I usually love the ban chan korean restaurants have to offer but this place was alright. The jap chae I tried from my friends dinner box was disappointing. It was mushy and didn't taste like how jap chae should taste. But I would say for the price, they offer pretty big portions. \n\nAs for their soju, I think it was $9-$10 for a bottle of plain soju which is I guess normal with most places. HOWEVER! I would not order the flavored soju again. They sell it by the \"pitcher,\" which in my mind, I was thinking of your average water pitcher. No, it's not, it's about half. Which I wouldn't have minded so much if it didn't cost $25? It was either $25, or $25+ And also, they don't have the price written up for how much it costs, maybe the menu did, I don't quite remember. But $25?!?!?! Really!?!? I can get 2 bottles of it somewhere else. \n\nAll in all, if you're coming for food, this place is pretty good. If you came to drink, I'd say go somewhere else.

We ordered the kimchi fried rice, kimchi tofu stew, BBQ beef bento box, and the redbean and mixed fruit icee dessert. Everything was good and came in pretty big portions. Our waitress was very nice and quick with giving us more fish cakes and kimchi. The pitcher of yogurt soju was big and even though you can taste how strong it is, it was still very good.

I liked it.

It's basically a hole in the wall restaurant. No, like literally, the front was just a door. We walked in and seated ourselves, without much of a greeting from the staff. The tables were pretty small and very close together. It didn't make a very comfortable seating arrangement. We were quickly served with that barley or rice tea thing. It took a while before we could order, or get a glass of water for that matter. I requested a glass of water three times before actually receiving it. We ordered what was like a Kimchi hotpot and some fried chicken. The hotpot came very quickly. It was filled with Kimchi stew mixed with some random processed meat like spam and hotdogs, and a hint of ground pork, and some packaged ramen noodles topped with some refried beans. It wasn't very appetizing to look at or taste. It was the most bland Kimchi stew base I've ever tasted, and they weren't even generous with the \"meat.\" It took a while for our fried chicken to come, and when it did it looked very.... well, it looked like they fried it while it was still frozen.

We were told the wait would be 2 hours and after coming back in 2 hours we were told it would be 2 more. Some regulars outside told us chances are we wouldn't get a seat no matter how long we waited. So I was so thankful we ended up coming to Arang because we were seated promptly and people working there were very nice and friendly. The food isn't as good as what you'll get at a place like Meogeoboka or Ohganae but it's quite a lot cheaper and still tasty. Here's what I recommend here:\n\nSea food bi bim bap - actually very good even compared to other more expensive and nicer Korean restaurants\n\nBeef bone and potato casserole - tasty and spicy, it has chunks of beef on the bone, potato, sprouts, jalapeno, other green thing, in a spicy broth. If you order the large one it can be enough for 3-4 people no problem.\n\nSea food pancake \n\nMussel soup - I try to always end the night with this. It's so soothing and tasty, just mussels, white onions, green onions, jalapeno, salt and pepper. \n\nSoju cocktail - lemon one tastes the best for me\n\n \nI also really have a crush on the waitress working here on Saturdays. She's really cute and nice. My friends think she's a little old for me but I think it's ok because she's so friendly. So that's a plus! \n\nSo, I give it 4 stars because I don't think the food is really AMAZING like places in LA or Oakland or Korea House in Hayward, and the panchan is not really very good, but I always have a great time here and the food is good.", "author": "Mastiff B."}

And most recently, maybe 3-4weeks ago. And usually it's late at night (after 10 or 11p.m.) because really, when we can't think of places to go, it's Arang to the rescue.\n\nThe first time was great. We had kimchi fried race, a plate of the chewy rice noodles, and a plate of bulgogi. I had never had the chewy stuff before so it took a while getting used to the extra chews I had to take before swallowing, but it was pretty good after that. Some of you might find it very different from \"regular\" textured food, so be careful.\n\nThe second time, I had the tofu soup and my gf had the bento box. The soup was okay, I've had better. The tofu had a good consistency (I think...). Bento box, eh..I never really bother with buying these anywhere. It's just the default item you choose when you can't make up your mind.\n\nThe most recent time I go the mackerel. I had eaten some a week or two before it and was just craving some more, so I ordered it. It came out EXTREMELY OILY! be forewarned..each bite of it and I could feel the oil oozing from the fish. I had to grab 2 napkins to pad that sucker down before it was safe to eat, haha. But once I did that, it was pretty good.\n\nOverall, 4 stars. Food is pretty decent, parking is widely available with the huge lot right there for Safeway. Then again, I've always been there late at night with no one around, so I can't say during the day. Service is shoddy..the ladies don't come by often enough, so I feel you guys about the water refills. Maybe the ladies are so tired by the time I get there? haha But really, I don't expect great service when I go to Asian restaurants.

He ordered the Kimchee Chigae/kimchee soup.  And we split an order of Mandoo/Korean pot stickers.  Soondubu Chigae was mild to medium spicy, but at Arang they add sesame oil to the broth.  What it lacked in spicy kick, the sesame oil made up for in taste  My friend's Kimchee Chigae was ok.  Nothing to call Mom about.

For some reason that night the idiot security guard inside safeway was keeping tab on ppl parking in that lot.  Literally we saw tow trucks coming in and out towing ppl's car.  The messed up thing was Arang had a notice written in Korean telling their customers not to park in the lot.  Ummm... Hello, non Korean readers need translation.

It is Oh-So-GOOOD!\n\nI had the lunch Seafood Bi-Bim-Bap in hot stoneware, for $7.50!!! There were about 5 HUGe and fresh shrimps in the pot, with abundance squid and some calamari. Not too much rice. And, the flavoring is perfect! I'm a big eater, and I was barely able to finish the whole thing, so I guess we can call that a BIG portion.\n\nThe service wasn't at your beck-n-call like a high-class place, but they're definitely attentive. The servers came to check on us twice to make sure that everything was OK, that's a lot to say for lunch hours.\n\nWe were lucky that there were no wait because this place is very small. And, for the price and quality they offer, I'm sure Korean food fans will be here very often once they discover this little hole-in-the-wall.\n\nI'll definitely be back!", "author": "Faye H."}

My bf likes to order the beef bibimbop, but like I said , for me it was okay. I do have to say though, the price of the food was very reasonable. The service was slow and there was just one other table that was being served. The restaurant was really warm and there was just no circulation going on in there.

The week we discovered it, we ate there 5 times in 2 weeks, and the waitresses even gave us free soda the last time we were there.  Arang is great when you want a quick Korean fix, especially when it's late at night and you don't feel like greasy diner food or horrific fast food.  Really reasonable prices!!!\n\nOrder the bi bim bap & the spicy pork plate - great combo to share for 2 people.  Even though I like to attack my food when it comes, make sure to let the rice of the bi bim bap sizzle, get crispy and delicious in the hot stone pot.  Just like the method to get great grill marks on a piece of meat, leave the rice alone!  Once you think the bottom has gotten crispy enough, mix in that spicy/sweet/bbq-esque sauce they give you.  I could probably funnel that sauce directly into my mouth because it's THAT good.  The crispy rice, the soft rice in the middle, the beef, and veggies (bean sprouts, spinach and mushrooms) and the sauce from heaven are a delicious combo.  The panchan are okay: tofu, bean cakes, kim chee, and my favorite pickled veggies (usually carrots and radishes).  If you finish a side, they are really nice and will give you more for free, which always happens to me because I only eat the kim chee and the pickled veggies.  One time, they randomly put potato salad in the panchan dish, and I thought I was at Hawaiian Drive-In and not Arang.  However, the service is always quick, and their servers are kind and attentive.\n\nThe music will make you go bonkers at times while simultaneously making you laugh or roll your eyes.  Their bathroom is one I would normally try to avoid.  The last time I was there it wasn't particularly clean, and there was a dirty mop in the corner.

It was really watery but I like how it wasn't too salty & overpowering . The dressing had a light flavorful taste . The noodles w/ strips of potatoes were fantastic ! The strips potatoes were cut perfectly the right size and it went really well with the noodles .. very yummy . I tried some of my friend's chicken katsu it was pretty good too . My friend thinks I'm crazy but I could actually taste the difference between the chicken katsu & the ton katsu . The chicken in the chicken katsu tastes more thick while the pork in the ton katsu is not as thick and tastes more smooth . I ordered a dish of spicy rice cake which was alright but kind of too sweet . My friend agreed . It wasn't really that spicy either . Their dessert (they only have one) was good , but kind of dumb & a rip off . It was basically just a lot of shaved ice , some sweet milk , some Cinnamon Toast Crunch , red bean and pieces of fruits .

(go to tofu house for that). waiter is slow but very nice. (used to hook me up with BI BIM BAP until a bad experience with a friend. now i'm a full paying customer. \nin a nutshell:\n\nFOOD: pretty decent, but go for bi bim bap\nPRICE: average, but lunch is CHEAPP!\nPEOPLE: who doesn't love young drunk people straight outtof a karaoke bar?", "author": "Rob C."}

The person who neg'd the jigae with spam, hot dogs and ramen...that's what that dish is all about.  That is probably my favorite dish there!  For the spam and hot dog lovers out there this dish rocks!  Throw in the ramen and it's an instant comfort classic.  For those who want this to be a cleaner, nicer place like Won Mi, go to won mi or other restaurants up and down Geary.  Stick with the basic korean bar food and you'll be happy.  I had a plate of gizzards with the ramen jigae and it made my weekend.", "author": "Al L."}

Please do yourself a favor and don't ever ever ever go to the  Won Mi place on Fillmore. I don't know why people are recommending it, but I always eat at Arang cause it's the best thing in that area. Last time I ate at  Won Mi, it was strangely empty, hard to get the server's attention (as most Korean restaurants anyway), and the food wasn't as good (the kimchi especially was spoiled- seriously).", "author": "kuju w."}
