By the way they do not serve hot sake or beer here. \n\nI ordered a sushi roll with the salmon teriyaki and both were really grim. The sushi roll seemed like it had imitation crab in it, & it looked rather odd. The salmon teriyaki was luke warm/cold to the touch & the portion was tiny and it oddly had bones in it. They both seemed like they had been sitting around somewhere waiting; not made to order. Also I was served a tiny portion of rice & the waiter said they were low on rice which left me clueless.\n\nI should've complained but I was very tired/hungry & the waiter was so lovely that I hadn't thought the food would've been so terrible. He was friendly & served an extra bowl of miso soup in the beginning which had my hopes up, but once my food arrived I was put off; it was frightfully terrible.\n\nThe food again was really grim & I won't be returning but I did give 2 stars instead of 1 only for the friendly service, not for the food & drink (lack there of) really.

Almost all of them  fell apart when trying to pick them up, which was terribly unfortunate and honestly not something I've encountered a lot of before. Perhaps the rice was prepared in a way that lacked some of the regular stickiness? In addition to that though, the rolls weren't rolled particularly tight and seemed to have a sort of loose end to them. \n\nBesides the presentation of the rolls though, we were not at all impressed by the flavors either. It might have been the ones we chose or just the restaurant in general, but at least for the rolls we got, we would never try them again. \n\nI definitely would not recommend this to my friends, and would highly suggest trying one of the other sushi places in the area (of which there are a few) before visiting Miyabi.", "author": "John B."}

We ordered 4 lunch special bentos - 3 #22s and 1 #28 (?), and a lion king roll. Miso soup was saltier than other ones I've had. Salad was watery and my bf tasted something rotten in it and lost his appetite (probably old lettuce). Chicken teriyaki was decent. Tempura could've been better - the batter was coming off before we even touched it. Rice portions are smaller. The worst part was the lion king roll. We were halfway done with our bento boxes before it arrived and it was burnt af. The roll itself was small for what it was priced at - $12.95 (?). We asked to have it refunded and the waitress seemed super stressed out and frustrated and upset when we asked. But she kept asking if we would order something else and pushing us to have the sushi roll replaced instead of refunded. It took 3 people to tell her we didn't want the lion king roll and we didn't want to be charged for it. She took the roll to the back and we saw her talking to the sushi chef, possible owner, and another worker about it like they were confused as to why we didn't want it.

Yep, hate to admit it but, the Acia bowl is one phenom that has slipped through those ample gaps.

Tempura fried in oil from the Edo period. Salad from a bag with a pungent unidentifiable dressing. Dinner guest with a safe and sane version of a bento, Teriyaki chicken.

I decided to give Miyabi another go, since it had been well over a year or two since I had been there last. The last time I went I had a bad experience which was MOSTLY based off poor customer service. I have never had much of an issue with food quality here, so figured it was worth giving another shot. Especially since not many places offer a bento box with EVERYTHING I want for under $15. My favorites/must haves are Salmon Teriyaki, Shrimp Tempura and tuna sashimi/maki/nigiri etc\nThey used to have one called the \"Shogun\" special but now I think it's called the 'Deluxe Salmon Bento\" or something along those lines. \nI came in for lunch around 1:30/2ish on a Saturday for my birthday. The front of the restaurant was full so we sat in the back, which was pretty empty. The customer service was GREAT (compared to previous times) considering they were a bit busy for lunch. The waitress was friendly and overall the customer service was great. She checked in with us to make sure our food was okay and overall had NO issues with customer service this time. The food was pretty good! My dad got the Deluxe Chicken lunch and my only complaint would be that some bits of the chicken were overcooked and really dry. Other than that though the food was really good and the fish seemed pretty fresh. I'm actually pregnant (Yes I am VERY well aware it is not advised...but keep in mind women in Japan consume it but prob cos quality is better) so I was actually being a bit picky about where and what I ate. Call me a daredevil or crazy but I had 2 pieces of nigri and was impressed by how good the quality was, for it not being a super fancy or upscale restaurant. I've been craving maguro sashimi (my fave) for quite sometime and decided I would lt myself have ONE piece while pregnant. Was very happy with the quality and freshness. They have tons of really affordable lunch specials for about $10! I think they have at least 5 different combos to choose from? I really enjoyed my lunch and will definitely be getting this again! Really filling and great for the price!  \nThe one I got was $14 for the Deluxe Salmon (Or Chicken) Bento lunch, which you get the following:\n- Miso Soup, Salad and Rice\n- Salmon (or chicken) Teriyaki (good portion size especially for lunch!)\n- 1 pc Shrimp Tempura, 4 pc veggie Tempura\n- 1 gyoza \n- 3 pc California Roll\n- 1 pc Salmon Nigiri\n- 1 pc Tuna Nigiri\n\nOverall was a good experience and they have definitely improved on customer service and quality!", "author": "Tara S."}

Read on, you won't regret it.\n\nI've been a year-long customer of Miyabi, managing to order twice a month or so. I always felt that it was a decent Japanese restaurant and was always content with exchanging my money for some of their food -- not the highest quality, but certainly not a place that I would be concerned with being unclean. PS: I'm one of those guys that has a Mother that's OCD about being clean, and so some of that passed on to me. My expectations are fairly high (though not unreasonable).\n\nOn July 23rd, I ordered by phone: Two rolls and vegetarian sukiyaki; this is my usual order. I have a little food now and enjoy some for leftovers. The order is always ready within 20 minutes, which I think is a fair amount of time. I pick up the order, take it home and start to enjoy the rolls. I work my way over to the packaged up sukiyaki, peel off the lid and find a COCKROACH soaking on top of the food. Words cannot describe how displeased I was/am...seriously, wtf.\n\nI marched back into the restaurant and calmly told the lady at the front that there is a cockroach in the food that they gave me. She said, \"excuse me?\"...Of course, I repeated it once again, a little louder and pulled off the lid to show her. She seemed fairly surprised and apologized. She offered to have the kitchen make more (uh, no thanks) or give me my money back -- the choice was obvious.\n\nThis is where my moral compass was tested:\n\nI considered going in, making an announcement to the restaurant that there was a roach in my food and offering to let people see for themselves so that they could make the decision as to if they wanted to continue enjoying their food. Honestly, I don't know why I didn't do it. I know that I would appreciate the warning if this had happened to somebody else, and for that I am truly sorry.\n\nMy two concerns:\n\n1) There was a cockroach in my food. That's disgusting and makes me wonder what else has been in my food -- cockroach eggs? cockroach feces? Other vermin?\n\n2) The cockroach was sitting right on top of my food (see photo). Restaurants should always pride themselves in cleanliness, but I hold restaurants that serve sushi to especially high standards. Mishandling food could cause extreme sickness and possibly death. If the kitchen let something this obvious go out to be served, what are they missing that isn't as obvious?\n\n--\n\nThe health department inspection from January correlates with my review: High risk vermin infestation.\n\nYou have plenty of sushi options in San Francisco and at least half a dozen in the Castro within walking distance from this place.

YUM!! \n\nThe only thing that made my intuition-gut detector go off is when we ordered a large saki and then said Nigori and the waitress came out with one large hot saki and a large bottle of Nigori. She thought we wanted both. Obviously some miscommunication and she took back the hot saki with a little attitude. Upon looking at our bill she didn't charge us for any saki... So that made up for any awkwardness and we'll go back for sure! \n\nOur dinner, along with a large, cold, unfiltered Nigori, and a sprite, was heaven.", "author": "Roya D."}

As a self-diagnosed hamachi addict, I get frustrated when the only hamachi-centric roll a restaurant offers is the hamachi-negi (because scallions are evil, foul-tasting things that should be burned off the face of the earth). It was so gratifying to find a sushi roll that offered twice the amount of hamachi and combined it with avocado (Nature's butter). The Salmon Ngiri was also pretty tasty and thankfully not made using wasabi. Cuts were rather thick and generous, and the fish was good if not the freshest I've ever had.\n\nAll of the servers were attentive and friendly, knowing when to appear and when to slip away.

The twists and turns of life have been induced by less consequential dilemmas, but I will put myself on the line and say...no, it's better to fry a catfish than have unfresh sushi.\n\nThat was the problem I was having when I decided to get a quick bite here after a Yelp Elite event at the Cafe down the street. I was thinking of going to Warakubune on the corner but didn't realize it was a sushi boat place. I don't care for those boat places since I never know how many times the uni plate has been around the flume.\n\nMiyabi is much more of a standard-issue Japanese place with absolutely nothing distinctive about it. I was intrigued by the $2.95 Steamed Green Mussels with Spicy Sauce, so I ordered them (see my photo). Three to a plate, it was a strange barbecue-tasting concoction that would have been a better hit had I been at Minnie's, I suppose. It was so gloppy that it obscured the mussels underneath.\n\nThe $9.95 Rainbow Roll was a tad fishy, not a good sign, and the avocado sliver was completely unnecessary. Hmmm, maybe the avocado was a cover for the fishiness. I also went for two pieces of Uni Nigiri (sea urchin) at $5.50 and four pieces of Hamaichi Nigiri (yellowtail) at $7.90 (see my photo). Both were adequate, but the damage to my palate was done. Game over. A few points for the nice server though.\n\nFOOD - 2 stars...a bit fishy...mediocre in a neighborhood that deserves better\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...standard-issue decor like the one hundred other Japanese places you've been to\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...she was nice and came by often\nTOTAL - 2 stars...pulled down by the food, I'm afraid...better to go to (gasp!)

Tonight was no exception.  Except one of the rolls I always order?  They added raw carrot to, which I cannot eat (I'm allergic to it, it will close my throat).  So we thought, okay, maybe the chef decided just to change things up a bit, we'll call them, explain, and ask them to redo it, since it's not supposed to come with carrot.  This *should* have been easy, right?\n\nWrong.  The woman on the phone ARGUED with us!!!  She claimed that they've always put \"mountain carrot\" (what on earth is a mountain carrot??  It looked like an average carrot from Safeway to me!) in this particular roll, that she's been working there a long time, the sushi chefs are the same, and nothing's different.  Um, wow.  My partner kept trying to explain to her that we order the SAME THING twice a month, and it's never had carrot in it before, and that more importantly, I'm ALLERGIC, so it's not like I've just \"never noticed\" before!!  Trust me, I would notice!  But more importantly, why argue with us?  We've been their customers for over 10 years!  I've brought zillions of my friends there over the years and given them good Yelp reviews.  We spend lots of cash there.  Why is she trying to tick us off???  I told him to tell her that, which he did as politely as he could muster at this point...and she continued to argue with him!  Eventually, she agreed to remake the roll, grudgingly.  \n\nWhen he drove all the way back to the restaurant to pick up the carrot-less roll, she was smiley, but CONTINUED to berate him about how she was right and he was wrong!  Wow.  Incredible.  He thanked her politely for the new roll and left, because he could see there was no point in arguing, it was just beating a dead horse.  She had decided that she HAD to be right.\n\nThere are MANY other sushi restaurants in this city and we would be happy to take our money elsewhere if they no longer value us as customers.  \n\nDear restauranteurs (and business owners in general), when you read a bad review of your business, before you start arguing and castigating the customer, try to stop and THINK about what you're doing first.  Is it worth losing a paying, long-standing customer just because you HAVE to have the last word?  Could there possibly be a better way to address the situation, one that will end with the customer going away happy and then coming back to your business again in the future to spend more money and bring his/her friends?  \n\nIn the meantime, I'm looking for a new sushi restaurant to spend my bucks at...", "author": "Amy L."}

DON'T PATRONIZE THEM.\n\nI totally got harassed & embarrassed @ #Miyabi Japanese Restaurant on Church st & Market for having a service dog. They didn't believe me when I said he was a service dog and asked to see his license, so I showed it to them, no problem. It seemed strange because I've eaten there several times before with my service dog and never had a problem, even when they were really crowded. There were never any problems before so why now when it's not even busy?\n\nThey sat me in the dining room with everyone else and as soon as I got settled in, they returned to ask me to sit in the back of the restaurant so as not to \"bother their other customers\", which I did. I wasn't happy about it, but I did as they asked because I was hungry and I didn't want any problems. Before I even had the chance to get settled in, they came back again and asked me to tie my service dog in a small dark corner, on the far side of the table where he couldn't be near me and where he couldn't move, because they didn't want anyone to see him & possibly complain and they didn't want him \"in their way\". \n\nThat's not providing good customer service and it also happens to be disability discrimination to treat me differently from your other customers. Any business can deny service to anyone for any reason, but if you're going to allow me in your restaurant with my service dog, you're supposed to treat me with the same courtesy & service as you would any other customer, not embarrass or make me feel bad or treat me differently. \n\nYou're only supposed to ask if he's a service dog and that's it. I pay the same money as everyone else, so why can't I sit in the front, in the lit part of the dining room with the rest of the customers? Why do I have to sit in the back of the restaurant, by the bathroom, by myself, in the dark, where the employees are sitting?? Don't treat me like some kind of 2nd class customer because I'm disabled and require a service dog! I'm so damn angry with them!  I was personally embarrassed & ashamed to be asked to sit in the back of the restaurant like I had to be hidden away. They made a scene about it. It's a tiny dining room so everyone in the dining room was staring at us. You're not going to treat me like a damn 2nd class person and get my money. \n\n\nI'm never going back to this restaurant again and I don't recommend them at all, especially if you're disabled or a friend or supporter of the disabled. Forget trying to get a seat if you're in a wheelchair. It's too small and uncomfortable for a wheelchair. Learn from my mistake and definitely don't go here if you have an assistance dog. AGAIN, DON'T GO HERE IF YOU'RE DISABLED. YOU'LL REGRET IT.\n\nIf you take the time to read the reviews for this restaurant, you'll notice that they do have a loyal base of locals that enjoy the food and have had good experiences there. I'd been a customer for 2 years without any problems and I thought the food was reasonable and conveniently located. However, you'll also notice a lot of 1 & 2 star ratings for bad customer service, bad quality sushi and food poisoning. Until this incident, I would've rated them as about a 2.5-3 but now I wish I could give them a NEGATIVE rating. I'll also tell all of my friends about my bad experience and encourage them to go elsewhere.\n\nDon't support businesses that discriminate against the disabled.", "author": "Vincent P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-03-06", "description": "On my first visit to a sushi bar I generally order sunomono, agedashi tofu, chirashi, and maybe something from their Specials list. On this occasion the special item was katsuo nigiri.\n\nPacing: Poor. Miso soup and green salad (included with the chirashi) came right away from the server. Before I had finished the soup, the chef handed me the sunomono. Finished the soup and was midway through the sunomono when the agedashi tofu arrived from the server. In the midst of the tofu when the chef handed me the chirashi. Halfway done with the chirashi when the chef handed me the katsuo (I expected them to come at the same time). For most of the meal there was at least one untouched dish waiting in front of me. Arrived at 8:00 on Thursday night to a mostly empty restaurant, out by 8:45.\n\nMiso Soup: Standard. Nothing about it stood out but it was competently made, with a few small cubes of tofu and some wakame.\n\nAgedashi Tofu: Different. Squares of tofu, about 1 1/2\" on a side, 1/2\" tall, nicely battered and deep fried. There were 5 of them served on a plate, on top of a piece of lettuce, topped with a sauce like a sweet version of katsu sauce. No ginger, scallions, or broth. Reasonably tasty but I prefer more traditional accompaniments.\n\nSunomono: Below average. They used Asian cucumber, seeded and thinly sliced, which was nice. The dressing seemed somewhat off-flavor - not terrible but not good. The salad came with 1 piece of ebi that was not very good - grainy texture and a sort of 'old' flavor. It also came with 1 piece of what I think was akagai, which was OK quality. The dish included two orange slices, which seemed incongruous.\n\nKatsuo Nigiri: Worst katsuo I've ever had. The fish seemed very off-flavor and it looked like it had been sitting around for a long time. Traditionally served tataki-style (seared on the outside), this fish did not appear to have been seared at all. It was drowned in ponzu such that the rice was falling apart. I ate the second piece hoping it would be better and wished I hadn't. I should have sent it back after the first piece.\n\nChirashi: OK. It came with about 20 pieces of 5 kinds of fish but they were cut small and thin (which I consider to be an appropriate size for chirashi) so I'd say it was about the equivalent of 10 pieces of sashimi. It also had some tamago that looked store-bought, a spoonful of seaweed salad, a few thin strips of oshinko and gobo, and a small mound of what I think was pickled plum. The fish quality was fine except for the ebi, which had the same texture and flavor problems as the piece that came in the sunomono. Plenty of rice. Standard presentation.\n\nShari: Great! The sushi rice was excellent in flavor and texture - just the right degree of sticky, chewy, and tender.\n\nCondiments: Wasabi from powder, standard quality. Gari (pickled ginger) was fine. Suma (shredded daikon) was typical rotary-grater style.\n\nTea: Standard with sufficient refills. No alcohol currently, so no sake or beer though they both appear on the menu.\n\nAtmosphere: Fine - clean and neat but nothing special. A lot of plastic containers and some plastic greenery in the sushi case, which I don't find very visually appealing.\n\nOther notes: No one behind the bar or hostess stand when I came in, took a few minutes for someone to appear. At one point an older lady came from the kitchen to behind the bar, took out a plastic container of something, and sniffed at it questioningly. This did not inspire confidence. Not a very impressive Specials board - it listed toro of tuna, white tuna, and salmon, as well as the katsuo. Considering how unspecial the katsuo was, I wonder about the various toro options. No oshobori (hot towel).\n\nOverall: OK for the price ($32, including tax) but not really worth another trip. If it hadn't been for the katsuo and ebi, I'd rank them higher.", "author": "Adrian S."}

BUT, the problem was the waitress' response, or rather lack thereof!\n\nShe didn't even seem to think it was a big deal or apologize or anything when we told her about it and sent the food back.  She just said that \"oh, it's cause it's sweet stuff, that happens.  it's not like a dirty fly, it's just with sweet stuff\". \n Umm, first of all, sweet stuff?  This is sushi here, not some dessert dripping in honey.  And second, it's \"not a dirty fly\"??

They give you a lot of fish and rice in each roll.\r\n\r\nMaguro - (tuna)  very shiny looking but didn't taste that great\r\nTamago - (egg) definitely not the best, freshest egg omelet\r\nPocky - (spicy white tuna with onion) this is the BEST one - very yummy\r\nDynamite - (spicy tuna fried in tempura batter with tuna and tomiko on top) OK, it was wasn't great but it wasn't bad\r\n49ers - (California roll with salmon and a small slice of lemon on top) This was a treat - the lemon brought out a great taste in the California roll. \r\n\r\nOverall, the sushi was good - there are definitely some good rolls and the service was ok.", "author": "Gladys C."}

I enjoyed what I had, but was kinda surprised to see they didn't include salmon in their Philadelphia roll.

I usually get the salmon teriyaki & sashimi combo box, but also love their sushi nirigi combo and rolls. The salad dressing used to be the bomb, but they kind of lost the flavoring in past year or two. \n\nQuick note on their soju cocktails: you are never able to order whatever you want!

All were well prepared, non-greasy and very tasty! \n\nI wasn't incredibly moved by the miso soup, but at $1.00 a bowl, what can you really expect? The waitress was positive and friendly, and in such a small setting, the personalized attention to details and service are omnipresent. \n\nWhen leaving Miyabi all of the chefs kindly say, \"arigatou gozaimashita, mata kite kudasai\" - which means \"Thank you, Come Again!\"\n\nFantastic!\n\nDefinitely recommend this place for small groups and late Saturday night eating (as they are open till 12:30am).\n\n:)", "author": "Carlos H."}

I've found myself with my nose pressed against their glass windows too often for my own good. So, here's the skinny in my own fine words.\n\nGOOD WHEN:\n1.

You just want to hang out with a friend (s), catch up, chat and are not looking to go all out... again, unless he/she pays\n\nGOOD FOR:\n1. Combination Dinner Boxes at $11 a pop are filling coming with soup, salad, rice and whatever combination you picked\n2. The Love Boat (I know! It's hilarious and comes in a boat) is a good deal with a nice variety of sushi\n3. Good old Japanese beers and saki (both hot and cold... like Kate Perry)\n4. Gyoza\n5. Oshiashi (boiled spinach with sesame seed) is nice\n6.

The seaweed they use for their rolls stood out for its flavor and texture, the kind of attention to detail that tells you someone is really paying attention.

When you get more fish than rice, meaning, they SHOULD NEVER pack on inches and inches of rice in your rolls or nigiri.  And sad to say, a LOT of sushi places in city do this. I call this cheating.  I'd say for amateur sushi eaters, they wouldn't mind or even notice, but I wouldn't qualify myself as an amateur anymore and good sushi is hard to find in the city.

Decent sushi, comparitively priced with the neighborhood, and a special treat to myself during my financially scrappy years.\r\n\r\nThe 6th time must have been a charm, or omen. I ordered the sashimi, which the chef decided to slice paper thin. For the price they charged, I swear it looked like 3 slices were cut from one normal sashimi slice. I asked the server if this was the usual serving and she flew into a tirade at me arguing. She told me that this is how it's served in Japan. Huh??!!! I've had sashimi all my life, and in Japan, as well, and it was never like this. I shouldn't have lost my cool, but her instant outburst pushed my buttons.\r\n\r\nThe server proceeded to talk out loud to the chef in Korean obviously berrating me. I've not gone back since, and checking out the reviews here for the first time, it's apparent I'm not the only customer fallen victim to their service.\r\n\r\nIf you're hankering for sushi in this area, go to Warakabune down the street, or Hanabi near Haight & Fillmore.

Miyabi proprietor, if you're reading: any product containing the term 'Love Boat' is supposed to be for two people, ok? Anyway, the Love Boat has about 12 pcs of your standard assortment of basic sushi, and provides a nice staple around which you can order some more inventive fare.  Saigon rolls are spicy tuna with tempura batter on the outside and Narita rolls are avocado, unagi, and shrimp tempura.  I thought both were well done.  \n\nI also had a soju cocktail.

Taking the M line, I mentioned how Ive never gotten off the Church stop. She said she has gotten off there before and knew there were a few restaurants there. I was starving, so I agreed to stop there. \n\nWe look around at all the different restaurants and we saw Miyabi. We were both craving sushi a few days before so we decided to try it. It was really empty when we first got there but it was probably cause it was 11am and I dont think a lot of people get sushi at 11 in the morning. We ordered a bento box with beef teriyaki, tempura, and california rolls. We also ordered a double dragon roll. We decided to share it because we knew it was gonna be humongous.\n\nA lot of people started coming in for lunch, so we knew that this place must be good if there were people coming in.\n\nThe waitress brought us two miso soups since we were sharing which was very generous of her considering the bento box only comes with one miso soup.\n\nOur food was brought to us shortly after. Fast service.\n\nThe food was delicious. It wasn't super spectacular like the best sushi ive had in the world but It was good and I was hungry. It totally satisfied both me and my roommate even though we shared.\n\nThe double dragon roll was delicious! especially if you love avocado! \n\nI definitely liked this place, way more than the usual sushi place we settle for at west portal, Suki sushi.

The quality of the fish, especially the albacore and maguro were pretty bad. The quality of the salmon was also mediocre. When you have 3 out of 5 nigiri in the entree at a substandard quality, it means any other dish with those fish will be of substandard quality... at least until they receive their next order. \n\nFortunately, I decided to give it another chance. The next time I came back, I ordered a deluxe bento box. It comes with tempura, ca rolls, 2 pieces of nigiri (salmon and tuna), gyoza, salad, miso soup, rice, and whatever main entree you choose. I usually get chicken or salmon teriyaki. For the price (around 10 dollars before tip) it is a great deal. Nothing stands out , but nothing fails greatly either. Maybe that first time was a fluke.. but the fish that come with the bento box always seems to be fine. \n\nService is good, they refill tea often enough, and the waitresses are friendly. For the price, portion size, and location (close to Market) it is a good place to satisfy your craving for basic japanese food. If you are looking for super fresh, quality sushi with an ambience to match, go elsewhere.", "author": "Jim Y."}

I could tell from walking in not to expect fresh off the boat sushi, so thank god I didn't go for an all sushi dinner. I went with sesame spinach starter and salmon teriyaki with a side of sashimi. While the salmon was edible, the spinach was as bad as the sashimi. Typically when a restaurant says sesame, you get the thick sweet peanut like sauce.

Like most others have said, it's a good place for sushi, but not excellent.  Service was a little weird (the hostess/waitress didn't speak a word, and the waiter left a lot of stuff uncleared on our table) but at least they were fast bringing us our food and the check.  The unakyu and mushroom rolls weren't as tightly wrapped as I'm used to but they packed a lot of fish/veggies into them, and they were only $3.50 each, if I remember correctly.  The bf got the udon and liked it well enough.  Salads were a little watery and they give you the dressing to put on yourself, which would be fine, except it's a little disgusting staring at a huge, unattractive bottle of mayo dressing while you eat.", "author": "Gina K."}

We had tried a couple sushi places in the area, but we were really wanting something new.  We stumbled upon Miyabi and figured we'd give it a try. There wasn't a wait, which can either be a good or a bad thing, for this occasion it was a good thing, a very good thing. First of all, the fish was fresh, the rice  was fresh-as rice should be when one makes sushi yet so many  sushi chefs seem to disagree with me on this. On my first trip I tried the tai, ika and the kappa maki,and  all of my selections were excellent. I also tried a kiwi soju cocktail, I was impressed by this as well. There were actual bits of kiwi right in the cocktail, it was pretty amazing. When the check came I was impressed, yet again. The prices were insanely low, I actually thought it was a mistake. However, I got over it and accepted the low fee. \nI have returned to Miyabi on several occasions and I have yet to be disappointed by the service, the food, the drinks or my tab!

However there are a few things worth trying. The seafood tempura combo is more than worth the price. Usually when ordering said dish at other places, you get the standard 2 pieces of shrimp, and filler vegetable tempura. Not the case here, you actually get more than just shrimp, you get scallops, and crab tempura, and a mix of vegetables, I think even squid. It is quite filling. If I'm in the mood for sushi I get the dynamite roll, a combo of white tuna, and regular tuna, which I don't think is on the menu but it's up on their specials board. The asparagus and sour mango roll is also good.\nThe sashimi however is not the best I've had, so I probably wouldn't order that again.  Some of their soju cocktails are just okay, I would say go for the plum wine instead.  An added bonus; its one of the few places  serving sushi at 1 in the morning, and you get seated right away.

He said the texture was off, even though the flavor was right. I guess I'm not much of a tuna connoisseur. The other rolls I had were: crazy roll (I got the end piece, not very much fish in it, but good), some sort of spicy tuna spring onion roll (pretty good but I don't really like spicy tuna all that much), whatever the sour plum roll is called (that was an experience!), and some sort of mystery roll that was deep fried and spicy (yum!!). My vegetarian friends got a roll with mango and deep fried asparagus that looked to die for, but I didn't try it, sadly. My boyfriend's beef sukiyaki was quite delicious as well--very flavorful & savory. I loved the rice noodles in the bottom.\n\nService: Only okay. It's a small restaurant and they were nice enough to push a couple of tables together to fit our party of 9--though they seemed a bit annoyed that we didn't just want to sit at 2 tables. The food came within a reasonable amount of time, but they were bad about filling up our water glasses--to the point where we were having to share waters because some people ran out and needed water immediately. When my water first came, it smelled icky, like moldy towels, but when I told the waitress, she was VERY prompt about replacing it, and very sweet and apologetic. So that was nice.\n\nFinal analysis: I'd go back! But I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to go there. Though I do want to try that mango asparagus roll...\n\nOn a sushi scale of 1-10, I'd say Miyabi gets about a 6.5 or 7.", "author": "Heather H."}

Every single roll I have ever gotten here has been amazingly amazing (try the Narita roll...or the Oshinko...or Jumping California...or Tobiko...or Inari...all of them, actually) and the service is excellent.  I'm quite the regular so I tend to get a free bowl of edamame or miso.  The Udon is also quite tasty although I like my soup very flavorful and theirs is very tame so I usually have add some spicy ground chili-peppery-stuff.  A+++!", "author": "Suzanne K."}

At 1am on a Friday night you could get a crispy spider roll fried in clean oil and a spicy tuna hand-roll with a wrapper that snapped in against your teeth, but lately it's been rubbery seaweed wrappers, dry-ish rice and stale fish.

This place is so authentic they don't even give you a soup spoon and you drink it straight from the cup. Both were good. Then we had a California roll, a roll with fried salmon, a roll with fried crab, and some roll with unagi in it. All were good except I wasn't crazy about the unagi since it had some sort of BBQ sauce in it. The crab legs were sticking out of one of the pieces, making it difficult for me to eat...even with my hands, because I fail when it comes to chopstick usage. Overall I'd definitely go here again.", "author": "Matt H."}

It's inexpensive as japanese restaurants go, and the food is good. Not spectacular and won't knock your socks off, but will fill you up enough to go back to work. I usually go for the bento box as that's the best deal in the house. I do notice that if you go when they first open at 11:30am, they'll fill your bento box with the previous night's chicken teriyaki. It comes out kinda tough as if it was recooked. So go around 11:50am if you can wait. The sushi is ok as i sometimes go for the tekka maki. So if you're on furlough or your credit card is maxed, then this place is for you as you'll still have a dollar or two left when you leave. Service is better when the newer waitresses are there. the older veterans tend to make you wait for your tea, as if they'll get to you when they feel like it. i wouldn't recommend this place for large groups. Probably good for groups no larger than 4.", "author": "Hagow C."}

I ordered a dinner combo - tekka maki with 6 pieces of chef's choice ngiri plus salad and miso soup.  The miso soup was not good.  The salad was even worse.  Wilty, questionable looking lettuce drowned in dressing.  The tekka maki was ok, but the ngiri was definitely not fresh.  The worst were the tamago and ebi ngiri.  The tamago was a dull yellow color and extremely rubbery.  I didn't even know egg could have that texture or (nasty) flavor!  And the shrimp looked like it had been sitting on the counter for several days... and then dropped on the floor.  Blech.  It is a little cheaper than the average sushi joint, but Sushi Delight has actually edible sushi for about the same price (if you can get over the kitschy name).
