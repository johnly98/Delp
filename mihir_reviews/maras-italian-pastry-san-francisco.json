It was my first time trying one, mainly cause I wanted to wait to be in a little Italy somewhere. With that said, I have nothing to compare it too in regards to quality & price. Here's how our experience went....\n\nAs we strolled down Columbus on our tour of Little Italy, we stumbled across Mara's. We walked in to a few people sitting & talking, a few men & a young lady that seemed to be doing homework. We walked up to an empty counter and looked over the menu, we didn't see any prices on the pastries which was odd. One of the gentlemen gestured to the young lady to help us in which she replied, no. Lol.. all good, like I said she looked busy. I'm guessing she was the owners daughter, but the gentleman ended up helping us. \n\nWe ordered two Cannoli's & two Lattes which came out to $20 ... as mentioned above, not sure if Cannoli's usually go for over $5 but it seemed a little much for a single pastry.

Flaky pastries proudly on display caught my attention and I made sure to come back after lunch to pick something up. The inside is quite small, just a counter with 2 employees; one barista, the other helps with the pastries and doubles as a cashier. \n\nWhat caught my eye was a bear claw ( I know, not really screaming authentic Italian here ) and a rasberry ring. Also got few small cookies (about one bite each) The bear claw was surprisingly dull, as in.. even though they were generous with the almond paste filling, it was dry and very mildly sweet. I can easily forget what I was eating. The rasberry ring was much better, with its flaky shell that's full of rasberry jam swirled into the twisted dough. I'd get this again. \n\nBeing in a tourist area, I expected to pay a bit more. But perhaps living in SoCal for many years has gotten me used to reasonable prices. Prices for the items were not posted anywhere. So 2 pastries and 3 tiny cookies that can be mistaken for crumbs came out to be $11. No biggie, but what got me annoyed and prompted me to give this place a 1 star is the service. \n\nThe lady that helped me acted like she just found out her husband left her for a young bimbo. Very impatient and did not seem like she had any interest in helping me, even though she seemed fine with the group in front of me. No eye contact, no words exchanged besides \"what do you want?\" I charged it on my card and when I asked for a receipt, she pounded on the keys, ripped the receipt off the machine and handed it to me while showing me what appears to be an eye roll. I bit my tongue from chewing her out in front of a room full of tourists ( and my friends ) \n\nMy thoughts were \" If you're the owner, you best take your ass in the back and not face the public, and if you're not, you should be fired on the spot and go check into therapy. \" \n\nI quickly found out other bakeries throughout North Beach has the same rasberry ring, so there's absolutely no reason for me to come back.", "author": "James L."}

Does NOT taste like coffee...maybe cheap office coffee that's cold. Yes I know that tiramisu is supposed to be served cold, but in the case of this cake the coldness just made the taste and texture of the cake more disturbing. \n\nThe cannoli: tasted a LOT like thick, lumpy cream cheese. Don't know if cannoli is supposed to taste this way, but I didn't like this. The \"chocolate\" cannoli DOES NOT TASTE LIKE CHOCOLATE. \n\nThe price for 2 cannoli and a tiramisu is $16. With the quality, not worth it. Sigh.\n\nThe cherry on the top is when we asked one of the staff to clear a table, he rudely told us that \"we could've sat at a clean table\" as he cleared the coffee cups.

Their neighboring businesses have come & gone, but Mara's hasn't moved or changed in decades.  It is this contributing continuity that helps make up the strongest leg this neighborhood is still standing on.  \n\nLike all bakeries, Mara's has its strengths & its weaknesses.  Their biggest strength is their cannoli.  And their weakness is the sometimes spotty service.\n\nThe cannoli is legit, even according to pure Italian standards.  Having cannoli w your coffee here is an authentic experience...from the first, ricotta filled bite, to the nondescript, card-room like interior.  This isn't a heavily ornamented, high end space in pac heights.  It's an old school NB bakery.  They expect the pastries to speak for themselves.\n\nThe honorable mention has to go to the raspberry ring.  It has never been my thing personally, but they basically have a cult following.  I have to say they are pretty fantastic when they're right out of the oven, or heated up.\n\nNorth Beach is still high on community & low on gentrification.  As a result, there are the old shops that can be standoffish towards folks they don't know.  Good business?  Certainly not.  But, it's a small bark with no bite.  And it is not at all personal.  Take it as the idiosyncrasy that it is.\n\nI have to give a shout out to Vince, who didn't mind chatting w me about a particular Italian cookie that used to be available at Victoria.

It made us so uncomfortable that we got up and left.  Even though the cafe was not closed, when other people came in she turned them away.   Five minutes later when we were walking by, the woman who worked there was sitting in the cafe by herself and eating dessert.  I would not recommend this place and I would not go back.  They obviously don't want anyone's business.", "author": "Ghazal S."}

We are talking really seriously delicious & fresh gourmet treats that you cannot find elsewhere in the SF/ Bay area, as far as I know.  This is not the processed garbage that they sell you at your local Star Bucket, Supercrapmarket or Costpoop Bakery.  I am sure that alot of this stuff is serve at the local upscale hotels & restaurants in SF....but they will not tell you the source.

You did not bother with crappy Supermarkets....you went to the Butcher, The Baker, The Fish Market, The Meat Market, The Bagel Store, The Ice-cream Store, & so on.\n\nThe only other pastries that we now go wild over are some real very limited homemade stuff made by a talented young lady at the Arroyo Grande, CA Farmers Market.  It sure beats traveling hundreds of miles to get to SF.\n\nBut if you are in SF anyway, this is the go to place for amazing Italian Pastries, which is right on the fringe of the North end of Chinatown.  It is a quite a good walk from either Union Square or Fisherman's Wharf...but you can alway cab or bus it back to your home base hotel. Parking here, like almost all places in central SF, is a nightmare...I always leave my car at the hotel & join the hoards of tourists & Chinese that are roaming every which way.\n\n& if you are wondering, it is so so so superior to Chinese poor excuses for creamy pastry!\n\nChinese excel at many things, but not at this type of pastry.  Chinese Mooncakes (filled with Lotus Seed Paste & preserved Duck Yolks) & some Dim Sum (Mochi Hot Black Sesame Balls) can be amazing & may bring you good fortune & fertility to boot!\n\nIn regard to the many other whiny people:\n           Who whine about using cash (bring cash dummy, this is Chinatown), this or that is better in Boston or NY (yeh, sure I am going to fly 3,000 miles for a Cannoli), or this was not so fresh (tough luck), that was too buttery (what?), the service sucked & they did not kiss my ass (kiss your own), the coffee was bad (yes, it does suck, it is not a coffee shop), the Biscotti was not flavored enough (WTF?), the Cannoli was soggy (life is tough), it was too sweet or not sweet enough, they do not clean enough, and ad nauseum.....\n\nwell all I can say, I have zero sympathy for all you whiners, grow-up or get out, no one really cares about your isolated one shot tourist experience....\n\nyes, there will always be hits & misses at any shop that has such an extensive selection\n\n.... but if you buy a box of a dozen things, you are bound to find some treasure\n\n& guess what if you really want the freshest, go when they first open in the morning....all you whiny Einsteins....", "author": "Paul M."}

I'm gonna let you know that the food delicious items here are easily 5-star. Let's not get this twisted from the beginning. If I was simply basing this review on the food, it would be 5-star. Screw those that say \"it's too sweet\" or \"there's too much butter\" or it is too much anything. It's Italian Pastries...so, get with the program people. You think Italians are walking around going, \"Do you have this in a glutten-free option?\" or \"Is there a sugar free option?\" No. Because they love food. So there.\n\nHere is the reason why Mara's had to lose two stars from their delicious 5-star worthy food:\n\n#1 - they only take cash. Ok...really? I know that you have these methods of making delicious food that is all old school Italian. But you should not have your methods of old school extend to the entire business you run. How many times have I stopped in for a quick bite and then realize that you have no cash. And then you have to figure out if you want to find an ATM close by or use the one they have there which charges an additional fee. Can you seriously not take cards? Or get a Square account?\n\n#2 - many a time, I've walked in and had the unfortunate luck to get the douche behind the counter. I love when it's one of the older people, because they're sweet and they're friendly and they'll usually chat you up. I like that. No, I very often get the younger folks who can't be bothered to help and don't offer any assistance until you have to yell at them that you're ready. And then when you do, they give you this look as if to say, \"Excuse me? Are you coming into my place of employment and asking me for assistance? How. Dare. You.\"\n\nSo, if you can overcome these two obstacles, stop in for a delicious treat. It's worth it. Trust me. Seriously. Honestly. It is.", "author": "Nicolas H."}

I walked in yesterday and I bought a cannolo with custard and croissant with chocolate sprinkles. The ladies behind the counter were not particularly friendly and they were just there to clearly pay the bills. One of them put the pastry on a napkin in a precarious position over the glass that divides customers from employees, displaying her lack of training or attitude (you won't see that in an Italian bakery in Italy). The lady then proceeded to put the pastry in a white paper bag and when it was time to pay she told me that the total was $11 so I thought \"HTF can 2 pieces of pastry cost $5.5 each?\". The cannolo looked like a traditional cannolo from Piedmont which is extremely hard to find around the Bay Area because every bakery and everybody is so self absorbed into glorifying the cannolo from Sicily which is completely different and, in my opinion, a flamboyantly overrated pastry product (as you know, Italy does not have 20 regions but only one: Sicily). The cannolo had the right dimensions, shape and proportions but it was filled with way too much with custard. I had it this morning and I ate 3/4 of it. I threw away the rest of it because the amount of custard completely ruined the balance between the filling and the pastry (one thing Americans still didn't understand is that it's about the balance of the ingredients and not the quantity). Next to the cannolo with custard there was a cannolo filled with whipped cream which is a blasphemous aberration of the true cannolo from Piedmont. I suggest you don't get that: it's not nice to curse on other people's culinary traditions. All in all I doubt I will ever stop in Mara's Italian Bakery. If it was truly run by an Italian family had the business for generations I would have certainly noticed it since I know something about cannoli from Piedmont and I am quite familiar about a wide variety of pastries from many countries and cultures.", "author": "X.

I love Mara's because they have many types of coffee, they have good gelato that is cheaper than most of the other places on Columbus, and they have more baked goods than your big heart (or tiny tummy) could ever desire. \n\nRarely is this place crowded, probably because many people end up stopping at the more expensive places along the way to Mara's (or at the Italian restaurants they were just eating in), so this place ends up being a little hidden gem. It's not a fancy place, and there isn't too much room to sit down and eat, so don't expect to bring a number of people and comfortable eat gelato and drink coffee. \n\nThe service can be a little slow, even if there are only a couple of people at the store because the worker needs to switch off scooping gelato, making coffee, and handing out baked items, so be patient.", "author": "Shreya G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-02-01", "description": "[11/20/2011, 11:00am]\n\nI am pretty surprised at all the positive reviews. Let me tell you our experience with Mara's. It was a Sunday morning. 11/20/11. We were leaving that afternoon for Washington DC after a nice weekend visit to San Francisco. Everything had been sublime...until Mara's.\n\nThe night before (11/19/11) we were walking along Columbus and saw the mouth-watering delicious looking display window. We had already eaten and were stuffed so we made a note to come by in the morning.\n\nThe next morning:\nIt's about 11:00am and we come into Mara's. We're starving and I can't wait to sink my teeth into a flaky, buttery pain au chocolat. We open the door. There's only one other person there, the owner, and the guy at the counter (first red flag). \n\nWe look over at the display of pastries, which looks a lot like it did the night before (second red flag), and pick out a few including a nutella-filled croissant, which had chocolate sprinkles (third red flag). I also order a hot chocolate to stay. \n\nThe guy behind the counter places the pastries we ordered on a few plates and goes to make my hot chocolate. He squirts an unknown syrup into a mug and pours some milk in, and warms it up. It's pretty cold when I get it. I taste it, not really what I expected for $4.00. I think it was probably some Hershey's syrup. \n\nAnyway, on to the pastries. I pick one up and bring it close to my mouth. No smell. No scent of fresh baked goodness, nothing. I bite into it. My teeth hardly make it through the hard shell. I force them down and manage a bite. It crumbles in my mouth and is stale, brittle and flavorless. Okay, maybe it's just that one. I move on to the next. Same story. I'm disgusted. We just spent $15 on three pastries and cold chocolate syrup milk? How has this establishment survived on serving old, stale and unappetizing pastries?\n\nI could not believe it. As I searched my memory, I recognize that the focaccia and all the other pastries were the exact ones that had been there the night before. How dare they. And how could I have been so foolish. How did I not even notice that there was no kitchen or oven in the place? Duh. Some of their cakes/sweets resemble the ones at Costco.\n\nI was so angry. Needless to say we left, and threw away the uneaten pastries. As another couple was about to walk in I warned them that the pastries were old and stale. They quickly turned around. I felt somewhat redeemed.\n\nI still wanted a good pain au chocolat, so we walked up the street to La Boulange. http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-boulange-san-francisco-3\nAMAZING. Highly recommend. We ordered the almond croissant, pain au chocolat, and a hot chocolate. A world of difference. Fresh, delicious, buttery, flaky, rich, quality chocolate. It was even cheaper. Go figure.", "author": "Michele E."}

No worries, it's Sunday, I'll wait.  When my turn comes up I order 2 Chocolate cannolis, a napolean slice, a sfogliatelle and a cream puff stack.\n\nThe cannolis are very good and very rich.  If you were to compare them to Stella's, the filling is a bit heavier with less chocolate chips.  Stella's cannolis are always chock full of chips when I get them.\n\nThe napolean slice was dreamy.  I really love a good napolean and that's a pretty good napolean, not the best but still very good.\n\nThe Sfogliatelle I ate right when I got in the car.  It's really nice with the crisp layers and citrus flavored ricotta.  My only complaint is that the ricotta is a bit too dense and I felt clogged with cheese afterwards.  I much prefer lobster tails but I guess I'll have to wait for the next time I'm in New York. \n\nThe cream puff stack had a pretty sugar glaze drizzled over the puffs which I thought was a nice touch.  But the filling I didn't like so much.  I was really hoping for a plain cream custard but this one tasted boozy and wrong.\n\nSo this place gets a solid 3 stars.

They had Florentine cookies, profiteroles, tiramisu and the largest Palmier cookies I have ever seen (Also, the biscotti and chocolate cake were very tempting on this warm, late, vibrant night in North Beach).  Gelato served here, too.  Other yelpers say they're pretty generous with their servings!\n\nLove Love Love the late night hours.  On Columbus, at Beach Blanket Babylon Boulevard (right across the street from Naia).  Cash only.\n\nPlus: if you sit outside, there's guaranteed quality people-watching opportunities.

The atmosphere is very basic, so don't plan on table service, but instead take your time indulging in the sight of the lovely baked goods.  Busy foot traffic with most patrons taking their treat and coffee to go, but a handful of tables are available for those who can linger to stay and enjoy their treat.  Mara's is one of the few places in the Bay Area to have my favorite, sfogiatelle, a scallop shaped southern Italian pastry.  It's not as good as the one I had in Italy, but good enough to stir the memory.  I loved thinking that I got THE LAST ONE, only to learn that they had put more in the oven; they bake them off a few at a time so that they are only serving the freshest pastry possible.  I think I fell in love a little bit when I heard that.  \n\nI took off one star due to them only taking cash only.  So bring cash, and enjoy.", "author": "Michele M."}

The gelato was probably the best of the bunch but it wasn't rich dense gelato, it was rather a unspectacular ice cream.  The service wasn't very friendly either, the girl working seemed annoyed at having to explain what everything was but there were no labels or signs and they have quite a variety.  They had a chocolate mousse type round cake and another bar type and she said they were the same when I asked the difference, they were obviously different with different layers but she did not want to describe and simply insisted they were the same.

But the lack of hospitality here really irked me. Combined with the unimpressive cookies I had here, I felt compelled to write my first one-star review.\n\nNot being very familiar with Italian pastries (well, I *do* know what biscotti are - thanks to Starbucks!), I had a few questions regarding what all the cookies in their display case were. It didn't help that most of them are unlabelled (except for the biscotti - *those* were labelled. Sigh...) When I asked though, the guy behind the counter was so rude. He barely made eye contact with me and seemed really annoyed. The one-word descriptions didn't help me much either.\n\nI ended up getting what he described as an almond cookie and a meringue. They weren't horrible, but I prefer my desserts to be good-enough-to-be-worth-being-fat-for and these were definitely NOWHERE near that. Not only were they sub-par, the \"meringue\" wasn't really a meringue. It was just a regular crunchy cookie. In fact, it was basically the same thing as the almond cookie without the thick coating of powdered sugar.\n\nEven though they were tiny I only ate about a quarter of each before throwing them away.

Especially the velvet cake. It was moist, perfectly rich while still feeling light, and laced with fresh and creamy frosting. We didn't even bother putting the pastries on plates and instead laid a pile of forks on the table and just picked away at everything until we were left with a mess of crumbs and torn pastry liners inside a battered pink pastry box. There is no need to second guess Mara's for its product, and this fact has made it difficult for me to give it so few stars. However.....\n\nThe service was outright terrible. The women working paid little attention to us when we walked in, and never asked if we needed help or were ordering for ourselves or would like a box. As soon as I was able to make contact with the counter woman, she grabbed a small bag and stared in question without saying a word. I told her I'd need a box, and as I was pointing to pastries, she grabbed them without giving me the opportunity to ask as to their contents or specify how many I wanted. When I did get questions out in time, she would look away outside or around the shop while answering- hardly making eye contact or showing any enthusiasm.\n\nIf you need a large order of Italian sweets, venture elsewhere- there are plenty of place in North Beach besides Mara's.

This time I made sure to remember the name. Hence, this review.\n\nMy mom had a cheese danish and a cappuccino. The danish was great and reminded us of the ones made by a popular neighborhood German bakery on the edge of Philadelphia. I had what I always have there: an amaretto cookie and a pignoli cookie. They just taste so good with coffee, and the folks at Mara's can pull a great espresso shot.\n\nI branched out and had an eclair there once - when I was feeling especially decadent and sweet toothed. It was delicious.\n\nThey lose one star, not because the service is grumpy (for some reason I have a soft spot for that), but because the stuff is not always fresh.

Hence, do not expect to find an amazing and cheap almond croissant, or great coffee beverages... I do think the place is unique of its gender for the proper Italian pastries, and nothing else. \n\nI love their Millefoglie: the cream (custard?) they use is really delicious and has always tasted really fresh when I tried it , and the millefoglie basis really is perfect. Also their diplomatico (or Neapolitan) is quite impressive. Finally, I also tried the cannoli, both in the big and small versions, and found both great too.\n\nok, of course they don't add stuff every 20 mins as another reviewer said they claim they do, but still all the Italian pastries really taste very fresh, and it's really really easy not to taste fresh when you have cream, custard or ricotta-based pastries. Also, maybe this really is due to cultural differences, but if the owner of a place tells me he adds stuff every 20 mins, I just take it as to mean they frequently do stuff, and I guess we both know it's just  a way of saying, I can't really see how this kind of comment can define them as liars and then having me dislike the place and not going any more...\n\nI do agree they charge too much for some items, like beverages and also the Italian products they have, like panettone, colomba pasquale...\n\nHence, again, do go there but onl for their Italian pastries, and I guess you won't be disappointed!", "author": "france d."}

The decor looked like a run-down donut shop: dusty with questionable hygiene. The pastries in the cabinet were small and charged by weight. I didn't feel like purchasing anything after seeing the cabinet, but the owner was watching me and I felt odd walking in and then out without buying anything. I purchased a normal sized palmer, which was $1. That was probably not the best choice for me to buy, but I wanted something inexpensive and not too sweet.\n\nThe palmer was flaky but slightly stale. It was overly crunchy and a little too sweet for my liking of those heart-shaped cookies. With a plethora of other pastry shops nearby, I do not think I will be coming back (unless I am really in the mood for a raspberry wreath I can wear as a necklace or a fritter 6 inches in diameter).\n\nNote: I have not tried the cannoli nor the napoleons (which got good reviews), but the sign said they were $5.95.

But if you were a sugar-aholic like me growing up... please continue...\n\nThe lemon sandwich cookie was tasty (very similar to shortbread with powered sugar and lemon filling) I didnt find this to be sweet enough for my taste though.\n\nThe cinnamon cookie was very tasty, much like a snickerdoodle, it was soft and just the perfect amount of sweet.\n\nThe bear claw was very big (enough for 2 days of snacking!) but I was not fond of the filling, it had raisons (a new take for me) and was no where near the sweet I was hoping for. I think of Svenhard's (individually packaged goodness) when I think of bear claws and I want super sweet.\n\nApple turnover, my boyfriend had this one and said that it was amazing, it too was huge and definitely lent itself for a 2 days of enjoyment.\n\nNext time I go I will try what they are known for, who knows my review may go up....", "author": "Sara Ann S."}

So I grab my honey and grab a City Car Share and we head towards North Beach. \n\nFor some reason pinole nut cookies are available all year round in San Francisco.  I have no idea why.  I thought they were Christmas cookies.  Whatever, i want them for Christmas, I will have them for Christmas Eve.  \n\nMiraculously we find a parking space in front of Mara's... \n\nI'm used to these cookies being $16 a pound.  If you haven't had a pinole nut cookie before they're excellent -- the main ingredient is butter and almond paste.  So the price doesn't bother me at first.  Actually, I don't bat an eye at it.   But I take the three stars away, dear Mara, because you get all your baked goods from Dianda's, and while they make a lovely cookie and a lovely cannoli -- the best of each in The City, I would dare to say -- they sell the cookies for $8 a pound at their Mission street location. \n\nAn $8 a pound mark up?

Unfortunately they only take cash, which is NEVER on me. So after passing by a few times and absolutely CRAVING a pastry by now I walk in finally with some cash and see a cream horn, something I've been craving for over a year. \n\nThe display of pastries is a bit overwhelming, half of the pastries and pizza laid out in the street window and the rest in a case. After seeing everything I realize I can't just order one thing! So I get a cherry turnover as well. The man behind the counter asks if I would like this to go and I reply , yes. So he stuffs everything in a brown paper bag, as I eye the little pink boxes behind him. Why does he give me a little brown bag instead of a pink box? Hell if I know. I should deduct a star because of that. \n\nExtremely excited to devour my cream horn why I get home I bite into it and realize that this isn't made of real cream, like an eclair cream, which I'm used to. It has freakin whipped cream? Not even a good whipped cream, like store bought coolwhip or something. My cherry turnover was burnt and not fresh at all. I don't understand why I came here. \n\nDon't let the alluring display of everything they have to offer fool you. The pastries suck. I don't know why everyone is loving this place?

Unfortunately we had our dog with us and no cash so didn't go in, but have been talking about it since. I had to go down that way today so decided to pull out cash give in to temptation. I have no idea what either if the things I got are called, but they were delicious!!!!! The first was this round pastry (kind of like a rope) with some kind of raspberry jam in it and sugar on top. It was really really good!! Really sweet but not so much that it was over the top. The pastry was flaky and had a great flavor to it. The second thing was recommended by the guy serving me. It was a diamond shaped pastry with two of the corners folded in to the middle, with an apricot (I think anyway) kind of jam in the middle of it. Again, this was delicious. Just the right amount of sweet and the jam was so tasty. The pastry was a puff pastry (which is my favorite) and it was just right. They were both a really good size too. I paid $7.50 which I thought was reasonable. I wish they took card as well as cash, but luckily there are plenty of ATMs around so it's not really a big deal. The guy that served me was really friendly also, which is always a good thing! Will definitely be going back soon!!!!!!", "author": "Elle B."}

Famished, I looked into the golden window and spotted the most beautiful palmier I had ever seen.  After I had satisfied my tummy, my eyes began to feast on the other pastries, cookies, and coffee drinks the authentic patrons were enjoying--most of the people in the cafe were Italians, speaking Italian, ordering in Italian, being Italian with their espresso. So, a few days later, I brought my grandmother who was visiting from Georgia here to have a coffee and a palmier. The palmier is significant because they taste exactly like an old patisserie that used to be in St. Louis, MO--my grandmother and I used to dine there, \"Andre's\" every day that she visited when i lived there. They decided to close one day, and we haven't found what they called \"butterflies\" that tasted the same since. Mara's \"butterflies\" (palmiers) were JUST RIGHT. I can't find them made like this anywhere else--crunchy and sweet on the outside and doughey and moist when you pull them apart. My boyfriend attests that the cannoli is quite good and authentic, being less cream and more cheese.\n\nI can't recommend a better hole-in-the-wall coffee & pastry shop.", "author": "Caroline C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-09-24", "description": "I have found the key to happiness in life. I will share it with you.\n\nIt is to carry a little dessert or some foccacia bread in your purse while you carry about your business during the day. Everytime you open your purse you get hit by a whiff of tasty, happy, buttery delights or take a peek at a little \"gettin' greasier by the minute\" brown bag. \n\nNow tell me doesn't that sound like heaven? \n\nI'd been to Mara's before. Who HASN'T been drawn in by the heavy scent of baked goods or a fogged up window filled with carb cloggin' delights (if I see a fogged up window I am happy because I know it's extra fresh; and that's a good thing non)? I'd more than sampled the baked goodies from the desserts they offer. Canolli? Hit or miss but when it's a hit, it's a m#therfarkin' hit! It'll hit your tasebuds with an assault comparable to the Mafia. Almond cookies, chocolate dipped, the little fruity ones--yummy! Gelato? So worth the price (because they give you a lot of it) and their coffee (lattes, capuccinos and all else) are equally worth your sipping pleasure (so much different than the \"please don't burn all the taste buds off my tongue\" variety we are all trying to hastily chug before going to work).\n\nI always get waited on by the little old woman in the shop. She might not work a register well but she always gives me a sweet smile. I think she thinks I'm Italian. She once asked me something in Italian and I responded in REALLY BAD Italian (try Spanish made to sound Italian). She actually gave me an extra almond cookie for my butchered Italian on purpose! Cool! If it means I get slighty better service for this case of \"mistaken identity\", I'm all for it. \n\nBut I'd never tried their foccacia until this weekend. I saw the tell tale fogged up window and a guy hastily pulling a tray away. Hmm...I thought...I NEED to try to that. So I made a haste right turn into the shop and bought myself a piece. Oh no, I didn't eat it right away. I had to SAVOR the smell. I walked (with John H. in tow--look I mentioned you by name for once!) from North Beach through Union Square all the way to the deYoung museum in the park. We smoked a little in the park (feeling the love of the Haight no?) and went back through the Haight, stopping at various stores along the way. Every single time I opened my purse (to find my wallet, my lighter, my cell phone b'cause I was one popular lady Saturday with all the texts) I was confronted with warmth and garlic and tomato sauce and green onions and butter in my nose! It was like having all the best parts of an Italian restaurant in my purse(ok not all the best parts--I don't have any hot Italian waiters hopping about in my purse). Finally as the munchies set in (around Divi and Haight) I plucked that little bit o' heaven from the blackhole that is my purse and me and the poor, ragged, \"why did I agree to this psycho walk?\", John H. and I DEVOURED this piece of foccacia in less than a minute. \n\nThe experience was as satisfying as an orgasm and can be done on a city street. Plus it's legal and I don't have to worry about offending children and families (nice to know even the Haight has standards).\n\nSeriously, buy a cookie, buy some foccacia, buy a canolli, buy a coffee, buy some gelato. They open at 7am and close no earlier than 10:30 at night. These treats will perk up your day and your taste buds. \nThink about a canolli or some foccacia at lunch, a latte first thing in the am the office or a cup of gelato after work. Mmmm.....\n\nC'mon you know you want to....and you know the craving won't leave until you fill it. Trust.", "author": "Veronica G."}

Canolis, danish, eclairs, cookies and many, many other fresh confections lie in the displays. This place is a dieter's nightmare! Lucky for me, I've waved off diets for life. Hooray!", "author": "n b."}

My friend enjoyed his iced mocha with a really rich looking chocolate-dipped biscotti. I had this really incredible sounding AND tasting drink: a Nutella(tm) latte! Who would ever think this was possible? Wow, so glad I ordered it! And more hazelnut-y than overpoweringly sweet, which was a nice surprise. I also had a yummy square of pizza, a very simple slice that seemed to be similar to a pizza margherita, only with fresh green onion added. The only downsides to the experience was cash only, the somewhat gruff service given by the help, and his forgetting of my pizza he had set to warm up. Random aside: open air tour vehicles driving by with tour guides pointing to Mara's like we were part of the window display instead of patrons sitting outside, so we sorta pretended to speak in Italian, then also mix it up with some Tagalog. Yes, random indeed. Back to the center of things--I think I'll probably visit again for all the cool treats and coffee. Boy, thinking of Mara's, now I have a hankering for a good connoli--anyone game?", "author": "Ryan T."}

My complaint therein lies in the price, BUT Mara's takes the gold! You get a true handmade cannoli in a decent size, done right, and for the right price. Whenever I see cannoli's I always eat with caution as no one makes them better than my nana did. The second I bit into the regular cannolo I felt like I was instantly brought back to my childhood. In addition, I ordered the focaccia pizza and fell in love instantly. The owner there told me he makes them fresh every morning along with all the other pastries there. Usually, I am like Anton Ego in Ratatouille when it comes to cannoli's and I had the same moment with the cannolo that Anton had with the ratatouille. Mara's is SUPERB! If you get a moment on Columbus Street I suggest you stroll into this little mom and pop and grab yourself a real piece of Sicily!", "author": "RaeAnne P."}

I say next time.. I'll get one of each, for review sake, ofcourse ;)", "author": "Food L."}

We went there and ordered an iced coffee, which we did not like and asked if we could exchange it.  They refused, and insisted that \"this is how we make iced coffees.\"  The guy was very rude and unfriendly, why not choose another almost identical shop which has hopefully better service?", "author": "David H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-06-14", "description": "Disappointed with the long line and general disorganized atmosphere of the ultra-modern gelato place across the street (or maybe it was the half-dozen or so idiotic, indecisive 14-year old girls), we ended up at Mara's for some chocolate gelato.  However, the cookie selection proved too tempting, and I went for an amazing pine-nut covered, almondy, chewy delight--one of the best cookies I've ever had!  The espresso was perfect too, with a nice, foamy crema.  The older couple running the place (the owners I assume) were very sweet and patient with the chaotic mess of tourists wandering in--a real talent in itself.  Very charming, unpretentious, and old-school mom-and pop kind of place--oh and the gelato was just as good as Naia's!", "author": "colette m."}
