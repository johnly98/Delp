The portion was good.  Too bad the chicken wasn't cooked.  I had to nuke it in the microwave in order for it to be edible.  \n\nPlain Udon - not sure what noodles they used, but it sure wasn't Udon.  \n\nShiitake Roll - Roll was good, but it's pretty impossible to mess up.  \n\nPopeye Roll - spinach & shiitake. I would pass on this as it tasted off.  \n\nSpicy Tuna Roll - Fish was way too pink.  It looked like it was dipped in food coloring.  \n\nSpider Roll - Tasted like mud.\n\nAside from potentially getting food poisoning, the food was just mediocre.

The beef was chewy and the sauce was rather salty than sweet. \n\nThe double sake and blizzard roll comes out and it does not look appetizing at all!! The salmon on top of the double sake roll looked so sad. I decided to try that one first and I already knew it was no fresh by the first bite. It was so fishy tasting and fresh salmon will NEVER taste fishy if it's fresh. It was disgusting. The blizzard roll had salmon inside with scallops on the top. That one was okay due the the fact that there was a sauce masking the fishy taste. I still didn't like it and only had one piece. \nMy dad had the tiger and caterpillar roll also said that was the worse sushi he's had in his life. So how was this lunch even worth $65?!?!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-11-27", "description": "After my relatives and I tried Noriega Teriyaki years and years ago, we never had a reason to go back.  The food may not have been awful, but it certainly wasn't very remarkable, let alone good.  So, imagine my surprise with how Noriega Teriyaki has suddenly become one of the go-to spots for my relatives whenever we have our impromptu get-togethers.  I mean, the only thing more surprising is how the food seems (slightly) better than I remember!\n\nFor the most part, nothing about Noriega Teriyaki stands out very much, save for the mildly random water fountain that's right in front of you when you walk in.  Both the decor and the menu are pretty typical of other teriyaki/bento box types of Japanese restaurants out there (and Chinese owned at that), but the latter does offer a wealth of choices to choose from, even if the ingredients aren't entirely authentic.\n\n-- SPICY GRILLED SQUID...$7.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/noriega-teriyaki-house-san-francisco?select=XmcR1haqkn-nBTwnc3tYvA)\nNot quite what I had expected, but not bad.  The squid itself was pretty sizable and I thought it was cooked nicely (just the right chew to it).  That said, I thought it was a little heavy on the (unagi?) sauce, which was pretty sweet.  At least they put the sriracha on the side though (which is the only thing that made this dish \"spicy\").\n\n-- CHICKEN KARAAGE LUNCH PLATE - Boneless Chicken Deep Fried and Topped with House Special Teriyaki Sauce...$8.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/noriega-teriyaki-house-san-francisco?select=YHpaPXQ_3MHQHR7-vqeIfQ)\nIt's different from most other chicken karaage dishes, but I liked it!  It's akin to chicken katsu, but with much better breading, a much juicier texture, and much more flavorful (compared to my friend's chicken katsu that I tried).  What's more, the portion was fairly generous.\n\n-- TERIYAKI DINNER SPECIAL - Tempura, Beef Teriyaki, Salmon Isobe-age, Chicken Karaage with Soup, Harukami (Imperial Rolls), Rice, and Ice Cream...$14.95 Per Person (Min. two orders)\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/noriega-teriyaki-house-san-francisco?select=dBqiHkGDH2AqbVE_dgZa_g)\nThe menu says it's \"for two\", but this was more than enough for our entire table to share.  I didn't try the Salmon Isobe-age, nor the \"Harukami\" (seriously...imperial rolls?), but everything else was pretty decent.  The chicken karaage was tasty, the beef teriyaki was surprisingly tender, and I liked the variety and crispiness of the tempura.  Solid value for the money.\n\n-- THE BOAT - 3 Slices each of Salmon, Tuna, and Yellowtail Sashimi, Tekka Maki, and Unagi,  Maguro, Hamachi, Ebi, Sake, Tako, Tai, and Saba Nigiri (23 Pieces Total)...$25.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/noriega-teriyaki-house-san-francisco?select=TTnDm0Y0oQG2_bnwUtWnIA)\nOverall, this was pretty mixed.  On the one hand, you get a good amount for what you pay and most of the fish was relatively fresh.  However, while the fish themselves looked fine (though the salmon sashimi wasn't the prettiest cut), a few weren't very tasty.  In particular, I wasn't high on the Tai Nigiri, Saba Nigiri, and Tuna Sashimi.\n\n-- BLIZZARD ROLL - Fresh Salmon, Avocado, and Tamago topped with Scallop, Ikura, Wasabi Tobiko, and Mayo...$12.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/noriega-teriyaki-house-san-francisco?select=Yi4lSzIyx8Fnnk_COyP5zw)\nEhh...this was okay.  It was cool how big the pieces of tamago were, but they overpowered the salmon inside the roll.  The scallops were nice though and I liked how the wasabi sauce added some potency too, which might have been a bit bland/delicate otherwise.\n\n-- SPIDER RAINBOW ROLL - Soft Shelled Crab topped with Tuna, Red Snapper, Mackerel, and Masago...$9.45\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/noriega-teriyaki-house-san-francisco?select=edzmm-SCSqYhcCjX_teTOQ)\nGiven how it combines two classic rolls, I can see why this is one of their more popular rolls.  Still, I thought it was just okay.  The crab was decently meaty and was fried up to a nice crispness, but I didn't care much for their choice of fish to top the fish.  \n\nAlthough the food many not have impressed, the service here is great, as it's been both fast and friendly every time I've been here.  That said, it's still all about the food.  While there are definitely better places out there to satisfy your bento box/teriyaki urges, you could definitely do worse (like with Balboa Teriyaki...).  Just stick with the hot/cooked foods, as the sushi/sashimi feels a little hit or miss to me.", "author": "Mike L."}

We stumbled upon this place and chose to give it a try - it's a rather spacious restaurant with Japanese decor. The staff was pretty welcoming and we were quickly seated as the restaurant was not even half full.\n\nThe food:\nSalmon teriyaki: I prefer my salmon cooked to more of a broil - with a slightly crispy outside and tender inside. The salmon here was rather overcooked, and rather uniform in texture, lacking the crispy exterior.\nTeriyaki lunch special: Three of us in the group ordered this ginormous lunch special including vegetable and shrimp tempura, chicken karaage, and beef teriyaki. The tempura batter was on a bit too thick, so it took away from my enjoyment of the tempura. However, the portions were quite generous. The chicken karaage was overly battered as well, and was less like chicken karaage and rather more like a katsu. The beef teriyaki had overcooked beef that was thinly sliced. Overall, portions were great, but the food was mediocre. Display was entertaining and it was fun to snapchat to your friends the ginormous stack of fried food.\n\nOverall, the food was average, perhaps a bit below average, but service and decor was nice. The restaurant was comfortable to enjoy lunch at and not too noisy or overcrowded.

And loves the ice cream that comes with it even if it is freezer burned or coated in ice. I have tried every category of food on the menu: entrees with meat that is overcooked and taste old and dry, sushi rolls with weird textured and flavorless rice with little filling, sashimi that smells and tastes old, and bland udon/ramen noodles. Even my old favorite chicken Kara age is not the same. Chicken seems boiled, then battered and fried. Super dry and they are getting skimpy with the teriyaki sauce which helps to flavor and moisten the meat. Tempura has really gotten nasty too. It used to be light, airy batter with good crunch.

When I got home, I realized that my sashimi was awful! 16 pieces of salmon, uncleaned with the skin still on. It was so unappetizing. I called the restaurant and was hung up on when they said they were getting the manager. When I called back and spoke to the manager she went back and forth telling me that the next time I had to ask to have the skin removed, which is ridiculous. Who does that? Sashimi is supposed to be clean! Then she tells me to come back (an hour trip) to get a replacement. Absolutely not..it's 8:00pm and I should not have to do this! I keep telling her that I will send her the photos of the sashimi and I'm simply asking for a refund for the sashimi.  She said there's no way for her to get the photos and she would not be able to issue a refund. Well, I made it easy for her.

It's one of our favorite places because the food is good and not expensive. When you walk in, one of the first thing you notice is a little fountain with water. I love this restaurant because it really gives you a Japanese feel. There are bamboos lining some of the walls and used as decoration.\n\nNormally, we'd each order an entree like chicken teriyaki, chicken katsu, or chirashi bowl and then order a roll or two to share. But this time, since I wasn't feeling too hungry, I opted just for rolls. I ordered the spicy scallop roll and the Pacific Roll. The spicy scallop roll wasn't too impressive. It's a basic roll with scallop wrapped inside and topped with a sriracha and mayo drizzle and green onions. What I did love was the Pacific Roll. Inside are lightly deep fried scallops. The rolls are topped with shrimp, avocado, and teriyaki sauce with tobiko. It's really worth the try.\n\nWe also ordered a Tropical Roll to share. It's filled with eel and crab topped with avocado and mango. However, since it's winter and mango is out of season, the mango didn't look as amazing as it normally does. It still tastes good though.\n\nMy friends ordered a chirashi bowl and a chicken katsu entree. These orders come with a miso soup at the beginning and a free scoop of ice cream at the end. Definitely worth it to try. I don't eat raw fish so I don't know how those taste, but I've had chicken katsu and chicken teriyaki before and I know those are good. It's very filling because they give you a lot of meat. Most of the time, I don't even touch the rice because the meat, salad, and soup are enough to make me full. \n\nThe service was pretty good. They came by to check up on us often. The restaurant was busy so I thought it was nice that they came by often \n\nI definitely recommend the Pacific Roll if you go here.

Being able to take the orders of 20 people and remember where the orders go once they arrive is quite a feat!\n\nOrdered: chicken udon, Gyoza, panda roll, fire and ice roll, dragon roll, fortune roll\n\nChicken udon was delicious, came with a lot of meat and the broth wasn't some run down, reused soup. Gyoza is like any other place's.\n\nRolls of recommendation:\nPanda Roll: if you like sashimi, unagi, and SPICYY rolls. \nFire and Ice Roll: if you like squid. It's chewy.\nFortune Roll: another one for the sashimi-lovers.\n\nAlso, it helps that they have very nice menus. Pictures always help with the ordering process!

The wait time isn't very long, the sushi is always good, the service is on point but most of all, the cost to eat there is very affordable. \n\nI have had experience both sitting down in the restaurant and ordering take out. The sit in experience is a very good one with the restaurant being very large and holding a very sizable amount of people. It's definitely bigger than most of the other sushi restaurants I've been to in the city. The menu is also very diverse, offering everything from nigiri sushi rolls, special rolls, ramen, teriyaki chicken and even curry! It's all delicious.

I find this dish to be a bit odd. There was not enough meat and not enough flavor sinked into the rice. The chicken was a bit rough for me. There was not enough sauce so after a mini bowl....it started to taste dry :(\nWe also ordered a bunch of nigiri (2 pieces). The fish was not as fresh compared to other sushi restaurants that I have been to. The fish were a bit too thick and not long enough. Fish on sushi traditionally are suppose to over extend beyond the rice itself. These one just right covered it. The fish did not taste fresh either. Though we did come a bit late, slightly before their sushi bar closing time but it is still no excuse. \n\n*Service: good. The waiter was polite enough to come to us, letting us know that the sushi bar is about to close but still take your time to order. He did not rush us in the sense that made it seem rude.

I think I keep coming here because of their teriyaki dinner special.  each set is $15 per person and you have to order a minimum of 2 sets. the 2 sets are HUGE!! and you really get the bang for your buck. each set comes with 3 eggrolls as an appetizer, miso soup, rice, beef teriyaki, mixed tempura, chicken karage AND fried salmon wrapped in seaweed. this is my favorite deal and with the minimum two sets, I feel I can feed 3-4 people. and think about it, one dinner entree is already $12, why not have a diverse selection?!!! \n\nbeef teriyaki - probably my favorite thing here, it is always cooked to a medium rare and the beef is very tender! they know how to do beef right!!!  highly recommend to order :)\n\nchicken karage - huge portion and is very delicious! sometimes they go overboard with the bre-ding on the outside, but it really depends on the busy nights. overall, very tasty and good! second favorite!\n\nsalmon wrapped in nori - deep fried salmon wrapped in nori. they put a mixed onions and carrot sauce on top so I recommend to eat it first out of the set so it doesn't get too soggy. it's pretty good, but I'm not that big of a fan of fried salmon.\n\nmixed tempura - lots of selections on veggies and shrimp.  for me, there's always too much tempura mix and the breading is too thick. however, I do enjoy fried stuff.... so I eat it... and sometimes just peel off some batter :P\n\nsushi rolls - awesome portions and pretty fresh fish. just a little heavy on sauce sometimes depending on the roll, but overall, pretty wide selection and yummy!", "author": "Josie L."}

Also, not sure if soba noodles are traditionally ever served hot, they were quite soggy in the hot broth. Usually I always see them served as zaru soba....on a bamboo mat over ice with a cold sweet dipping sauce. Or as ten zaru with some type of tempura, but this was wayyyy weird having hot soba lol NEVER AGAIN. \n\nIt was also strange how my friend ordered sukiyaki and they completely forgot to add the clear noodles that come with the sukiyaki.  They promptly brought over a side of clear noodles when we notified them of the missing noodles, and all was well.  \n\nAlso, what kid of Japanese restaurant serves deep fried salmon wrapped in seaweed as an entree???

Since they all ordered cooked food, I thought maybe I should be different and order something with raw fish so I got the chirashi. \n\nFor the price, the chirashi had a pretty good portion size and variety of seafood. The regular fishes like salmon and tuna were fine. The tuna looked a little washed out, but it still tasted ok. The best part was a plump, shimmering piece of hotate, which was sweet and succulent. Some things could use some improvement though. I think there was a piece of tai that was oddly spongy. Maybe it spent too much time in the freezer. The saba was also pretty rough and chalky, and the rice was too sweet and was covered with some weird pickled vegetables. It was far from perfect, but you can't really expect a place like this to be super stellar.\n\nThe hot food seemed to be better than the raw fish. I tried the beef teriyaki, and it wasn't bad. I guess it's hard to go wrong with grilled meat. It had a good sear and was tender enough. They used too much of the generic, sweet teriyaki sauce, but it still tasted ok. Other people seemed to like the tempura and salmon teriyaki entrees as well.

Noriega Teriyaki House was less than a block away from where we were staying, so we decided to head that way.\n\nWe were greeted by this taller Asian waitress, we'll call her Grumps McGrumperson.  She seated us in the booth right next to the entrance.  It took a bit to flag her down to place our order.  When she came over, my sister asked a question about one of the specials.  Grumps responded with a laugh and \"Oh, I don't know.\"  She walked towards the sushi chef like she was going to ask him and then headed straight into the kitchen.\n\nMy sister let her know that we didn't need to know what the specials were and wanted to order anyway, but she just kept walking away.  After trying to get her attention a second, third, and fourth time to order, it was becoming obvious that she was ignoring us.  She'd see us, make eye contact, and then look away.  We then ended up getting the attention of the only other waitress in there, we'll call her Happy.  I'd call them by their names but neither was wearing a name tag.\n\nHappy was SO friendly and took our orders down quickly.  Shortly after, she brought us some chopsticks, placemats, and napkins.  The food came out relatively quickly after ordering.  Happy would make it a point to come to the front of the table, explain what the dish was in her hand, and gently place it on the table.  If Grumps had to bring us anything, she'd slip it over the couch and just drop the plate onto the table without a word.\n\nIf Happy was occupied with another customer and we needed something, we'd try to get Grumps' attention.  Again, she'd look at us then look away.  Or, she'd tell Happy to come even though Grumps was literally doing nothing.\n\nHonestly, I have no idea what we did to Grumps other than ask a simple question.  Perhaps it was shark week for her, who knows.  If this review was solely based on service, Noriega would get 1 star.  Here's the thing, I've been to plenty of Asian restaurants and I know that you don't go for the service.  But her behavior was beyond anything I've ever experienced at any restaurant in my entire life.\n\nAbout the food?  I can't even remember if anything was good because Grumps made our experience so terrible.  \n\nI'll give another star for Happy because she was great.  We even gave her the cash tip personally so Grumps couldn't take any of that money.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

The male server admitted he made a mistake and had brought our table's rolls to another table but didn't even remotely seem apologetic. I understand mistakes happen, but it would have been nice to address your mistake and inform your patrons. After another 10-20 minutes, our rolls finally came to the table. The tuna and salmon were not fresh, and the rolls were subpar. We had to ask multiple times to have our table cleared, for more tea/napkins, and one too many times for the check.

Looks like you'd expect a Japanese restaurant to look, but not too fancy. I would've taken a long time and a lot of dough perhaps to get in a full look at the sushi menu, so I settled on the salmon sashimi and beef teriyaki \"chef's special\" for $13.95. I also wanted to try the ivory tuna nigiri posted on the board, but I was quite disappointed to find out that they ran out.\n\nFirst thing that came out was this little thing of sliced cucumbers and some sort of yellow sauce. It was surprisingly good, kinda sweet. Miso soup was next, and it was also pretty good. Then the main platter came out... well, to our other table at first because the server didn't know where it was supposed to go. But let me tell you, that first bite of salmon sashimi was heavenly. I'm sad that there were only four pieces, but they were pretty generously cut.\n\nAs for the rest of it, the beef teriyaki was good, but I wish it had been a little bit more tender. Salad was okay, but I wish there was more dressing. Daikon strings didn't seem good for anything, so I left it alone. I also had my first tastes of futomaki, which was pretty good for vegetarian, and albacore tatari, which was somewhat perplexing (for me) with its cool interior and warm exterior. It was delicious though, no doubt. And when we got to dessert, I had coffee ice cream and tried somebody else's green tea. Both were pretty good, although the green tea had more sweet and less green tea flavor than I'm used to.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't mind coming back here.

I wasn't very satisfied with their udon. Compared to the beef udon I had at Kippu in Japantown, this one was lacking. The broth was good, but something about the meal was not fulfilling. The one at Kippu was much more hearty.\n\nOverall, I would come back here for their sushi and maybe try other noodle type dishes they have.", "author": "Krystal C."}

Happened to be in the area doing some laundry, so I found this place out of convenience down Noriega. \n\nThe decor is very nice, definitely reflects a typical Japanese restaurant. Was seated quickly and given some lovely tea to start. \nWent with the sukiyaki and tempura combo. Definitely underestimated the amount of food I would receive!! Got some egg rolls, miso soup, side of rice, side of cucumbers, the actual bowl of sukiyaki and the tempura. And ice cream. I'm small and I constantly order with my eyes instead of my stomach. This is a perfect example of that. \n\nMy favorites were the tempura, miso soup, and eggrolls. All of it was crisp and freshly cooked. Burned my tongue. I get excited to eat sometimes.\n\nSadly the sukiyaki wasn't my complete favorite. Really salty, and the texture of the meat was really off. Typically I enjoy this dish. Also served in a hot pot, which was nice but may have overcooked the food.\n\nDespite that, the service was very attentive, the rest of the food was good and what I got was reasonably priced. I'm down to try this place again!", "author": "Kristine T."}

One of the things we love most is that they deliver, and they're usually really fast. They're always super friendly when we dine in or order delivery. He loves the salmon roll and I love the spider rainbow roll. Those are usually our go to rolls. I don't like raw stuff, so he usually picks off the raw fish off my roll. We also get the steak teriyaki bento which comes with soup, salad, tempura, mini egg rolls, and ice cream when delivered. It's pretty good, nothing special but nothing bad. \n\nFor someone who likes cooked stuff, I would definitely recommend this place.

Seriously, why do they list gyoza as an appetizer if it always takes the longest to come out? We had to keep flagging people down to ask about our food, and they'd explain that they were really backed up. The restaurant is like a quarter full and it's 2:30pm. What's going on here? I also didn't appreciate that they didn't tell us sooner that there would be a longer-than-normal wait. \n\nWhen our food finally came, it was just OK.

We ended up ordering 3 rolls, the Tuxedo, the Bumble Bee, and the Eclipse. The Tuxedo was mildly spicy, the Eclipse was moderately spicy, and the Bumble Bee was the spiciest. I would recommend all of these rolls. The fish tasted fresh and the flavors of each roll worked well together. The only downside is that the Bumble Bee and Eclipse rolls took significantly longer to make than the Tuxedo roll, which was surprising because the restaurant was not that busy at the time.\n\nOverall, I would definitely come here again!\n\nTip: they have a much larger sushi menu when you eat in the restaurant versus their online menu.", "author": "Stacie W."}

They loaded on the rice and the slices of fish meat were thin and tearing apart.. Not cool at all.\n\nWhat made me fall in love with this place was the fact that they have sukiyaki for cheap!

The place is big and the staff well meaning, but the place is terribly dated and the food is suffering. \nFirst, upon entering you see (and smell) this ugly 1970's looking waterfall / fake tree thing. Management - this thing has to go. It smells like an old fish tank and has no place in a restaurant. I can't imagine it's sanitary in the sushi bar. It's ugly, smelly and wastes space. \nThe next thing you notice are the huge unused \"board room\" tables which look straight out of 1963 (along with the dated but cool light fixtures). Honestly - if you have so much space that you can leave these huge empty tables... Better to get rid of them, improve the food and fill up a lot of small tables.\nThen we sat and I can't complain except the furniture, floor and decor is dated and worn out. The look of the place got me preparing for an out of date and less than satisfying meal. Pretty hard to do with Japanese food but they did not fail to disappoint. \nLook - I support small business and love it that these guys have a big restaurant for decades. But you have to update and keep up with the times. They have a big corner space - update it and make it a success again. \nOk so then comes the free cucumber appetizers which are covered in a yellow sugar sauce from 1977 which I can only describe as disgusting. Borderline old cucumber in nasty yellow goo. Not a good start. \nThe hot sake comes with the bottle floating in a bamboo thing filled with disgusting dirty water. We figured out this was an attempt to serve the sake in hot water. The funny part was that the sake was not the correct body temperature, but still tepid. So the bamboo tube doesn't work. Inside the bamboo is a lot of muck and black stuff - I don't even know what, but it's dirty. All I could think is \"great - now we have to be careful not to drip this nasty water on our food.\" Get rid of the bamboo, people. It's gross. \nThen the sushi comes. Covered in mayonnaise. Good quality fish, way too much avocado, way terrible sauce. Honestly mayo has no place on sushi - it's all we could taste. Nasty. \nThen the cooked food arrived. Since it's the teriyaki house, we got some teriyaki dishes. Beef teriyaki - the meat was completely untrimmed and about 1/3 inedible fat. Gristle on both ends. Undercooked and chewy, but good flavor from a bottle of teriyaki sauce. Salmon was quite good. However, the bulk of the plate was covered in salad - bad salad. Brown lettuce and 1 skinny tomato slice. Pathetic greens, left uneaten. \nAll in all, the service was excellent, the food was presented nicely, but the decor is terrible and the food needs a major update. Can't recommend this place at all when there are so many great Japanese restaurants right down the street. On the plus side, my dining partner has been there a few times and says the sushi is good. The rolls on the menu look interesting, but the one I tried was not impressive. The fish quality seemed good, but hard to tell covered in mayo.", "author": "Bill W."}

There was no line, but they were filled up.\n\nMy friend and I shared some dishes, so we went for the basic rolls and Soba Noodles. The basic rolls I got was Sushi Combo #3 (Hamachi Maki, Maguro, Unagi, Tako, Ebi). My favorite from that selection was the Maguro. I didn't particularly like the Hamachi Maki but everything else was okay.Then, we also got the Chicken Soba which I didn't think was very good, actually. It was plain and didn't have that much flavor.\n\nTo be fair, I did enjoy my friend's roll. I think it was the Cherry Blossom Roll, but whatever it was, it was delicious!\n\nThis place just wasn't outstanding enough with all of the Japanese restaurants around, but the prices are pretty decent and maybe I just need to give it another try with the Special Rolls!", "author": "Ivy L."}

I honestly have never seen small Shanghai-typed noodles used in a bowl of udon before.  I was expecting the big fat noodles.  They also put into the bowl chunks of salmon that were so fatty that I had to throw half of them out...and this is coming from someone who loves salmon.  They also had a chunk of cooked tuna that was so fishy it was pure disgusting.  I hated my dish.  So disappointed.\n\nAlso ordered the sushi combo B that had salmon,  hamachi,  tuna,  egg nigiris and 3 \"California rolls.\"  The California rolls came out with the seaweed outside.  Am I wrong to assume that California rolls usually have the rice outside?  When asked, they said, oh it's their style and if we wanted the rice outside we would need to ask.

It was a terribly busy Saturday evening and there were no tables available, so we decided to eat at the bar.  My daughter had ordered from the children's menu.  We got our food, but the waitress drops one of the pocky sticks from the plate onto the floor and said she would get my daughter another one.  Well, we never got the pocky stick and the waitress conveniently forgets the whole incident.  We asked and she just said she doesn't even remember that happening.  If it had been sushi or something bigger, I would have asked the manager on duty to talk to us about this.  The waitress didn't apologize or anything.  She said they don't give out extras?!  I'm sorry, but we wouldn't have asked for more if it wasn't dropped by her.  I almost vowed never to come back again.  However we did come back because of other family members wanting sushi.  Fortunately, she wasn't there that night.  Everything turned out fine that evening.  We have been customers at this restaurant for about 4 yrs and have never had this waitress or this kind of service.  Still pretty disappointed in how she handled this situation.

One of the only places open relatively late on Memorial Day, we decided to indulge in some Japanese food.\n\nI ordered the chirashi bowl, an assortment of sashimi over rice, and sort of resembled a deconstructed sushi roll.  The meal started with some miso soup, which I thought was under seasoned and sort of bland.  I enjoy the variety of fish offered in the bowl and usually really enjoy the sushi rice.  However, the rice wasn't very well vinegared in this case and was barely warm.  The fish quality was reasonable, though not nearly as fresh as Shimo's, and the pieces were impressively large.  The tuna and red snapper were definitely my two favorite pieces of fish in this particular selection.\n\nWe also ordered the San Francisco roll (spicy tuna roll topped with eel and avocado) and the double hamachi roll (hamachi roll topped with hamachi and avocado).  I found neither very special and both felt unimaginative.\n\nThe meal was finished with a small scoop of green tea ice cream, which had a neon green, almost unappetizing, glow to it.  It tasted decent enough, but like the rest of the meal, was only mediocre.  This was no Mitchell Brothers ice cream.\n\nOverall, Noriega Teriyaki House gets a passing grade from me, but I don't think that I would go too far out I my way for it.  It was fairly expensive for what you got and, for the money, I would definitely expect the quality bar to be raised.

First place that came to mind was Noriega Teriyaki House which is just a few blocks away from my place. I've been here a few times, and the food was quite decent.\n\nWe were seated right away and served green tea in a huge tea pot by this nice Chinese lady. I'm a huge tea drinker so I hate going to restaurants where I have to keep asking for refills. Here they give you a gigantic pot, so you can refill yourself. \n\nWe decided on the following sushis: \n\nPANDA ROLL (7 pieces): This is supposed to be one of their specialty rolls. I didn't find it special at all... It was white tuna, unagi, avocado and topiko on top of what might have been a California roll? I forgot... The tuna wasn't fresh, and the ingredients don't go well together in my opinion. We won't be ordering this next time.\n\nFUTOMAKI (8 pieces): Yummy, but nothing special.\n\nPINK SALMON ROLL (8 pieces): My favorite out of the 4 rolls. The salmon was hot and steamy. The fish was very tender. I've had Pink Salmon Rolls at other restaurants where the salmon is cooked all the way so it becomes dry. Here they make it perfectly.\n\nSPICY SCALLOP ROLL (6 pieces): I really wouldn't this a Spicy Scallop Roll... It's more like a Scallop Roll with hot sauce drizzled on top? The scallops were tasteless and the hot sauce wasn't even hot at all! Wayne liked it though.\n\nTAMAGO NIGIRI (2 pieces): The tamago (eggs) was sweet. I like my eggs that way but it was cold and tasted refrigerated. \n\nThis place is really a 2.5 to 3 stars for me, but I'll give it a 3 since the waitress was very attentive and the service was good.

Also, last time I went, the shrimp tempura was so awful, the shrimp tasted rotten and shriveled up.  I took the thick heavy tempura batter off and there was only a shrivel of a shrimp under there.  I think they cut the shrimp into three long little slices to save money.\n\nThe waiters/waitresses don't pay any attention to any of us in the table.

The breading was different - not as crunchy as a katsu's breading.\n\nI wish they added free green tea ice cream to the lunch combos cause I always crave for something sweet after every meal. Sad face. And I wanted a sushi roll but it's crazy expensive here.\n\n***OK experience but I was kinda baffled when I asked the waitress if I could switch my $20 bill for smaller bills.

My friend wanted to order sushi along with this. I told her not to, because the lunch combination special included A LOT OF FOOD.\n\nIt was so good, because we were starving. Surprisingly, we actually finished it. I felt so full after eating only half of my portion. I don't know if it's me or what, but the beef teriyaki and chicken karage were really salty.

I just really didn't know where to grab Japanese food around the hood, so I settled with Noriega teriyaki house. Came here on New Years day to find that they were open.. and very surprised since some other places were closed for the \"holiday\". We got seated right away, even though the place was packed.. guess we got lucky with the table. Any who, the menu is pretty big, lots of selections and we decided on two lunch plates and a roll. I couldn't decide on which roll I wanted and the 49er roll sounded good (especially since they won that day).. lol.. but sadly I didn't know the scallops were raw.. so it was super fishy and hard to go down after a crazy night of NYE drinking.. overall though, the roll was good and the sashimi tasted fresh. I got the chicken karage lunch plate and it was huge! It came with a big ol salad, a fried potato and rice. Definitely worth it and I barely touched my plate since I was already full from the miso soup and sushi.. so I had lots of left overs to take home.", "author": "Tiff C."}

So far, I've been here twice.  But...it's all about the CHICKEN KARAAGE....mmm *rubs tummy!*  It's perfectly fried with this amazing sauce drizzled on top (teriyaki sauce?).  Prices for dinner are decent considering that they give you a ginormous amount of food along with soup, salad, cucumber slices drizzled with honey mustard dressing, rice & a scoop of ice cream.  Last time I got the sherbet since I don't like green tea, it was very sweet & super cold (hurted my teeth a little) so eat it cautiously.  \n\nI've had the chicken udon, which didn't look so appealing because of how the meat looked.  I was disappointed because it lacked flavor.  Maybe I should've asked for the chili powder?  He and I shared the Super Burrito Roll, which was shrimp tempura roll with Sriracha; it doesn't compare to a similar Crunch Roll from Joy Sushi in San Mateo, but it was still tasty.  Next time I will definitely ask for more Sriracha on the side.  \n\nService has been great both trips and parking has never been difficult.

For one thing, it is not a fancy Japanese restaurant, which works for me since I have a 3 year old. I need a fast efficient and friendly place, and Noriega Teriyaki fits the bill. Yes they are chinese owned and staffed so this is not the most authentic place in the world. But the food has always been good. Usually with 3 or four people we grab one or two combo dinners, and one or two combo sushi platters/boats, and we all share. \n\nIf you are looking for fresh sushi flown in from Japan, this is not the place. This is just your basic place that buys their sushi flash frozen, then does a good job preparing it so it tastes good. Usually the hamachi, maguro, and unagi are pretty good here. And don't forget most combos come with miso soup, sunomono (pickled cucumbers - my son ate all of his and everyone else's!) and ice cream.

There is like 2 pieces and it cost $9. Thats not the worst of it..the worst of it is they decide to cut ONE piece of UNI, split it and put on top of the Salmon. WHO DOES THAT? For the price we pay, I expect at least one FULL piece of uni on each of the 2 pieces. The UNI were size of a dime.They hella try to jipp you. Oh and on top of that, the salmon they wrap around the sushi with had some of the bad parts of the salmon on it. Like the skin. Salmon,when cutting off some parts you don' eat, should be all ORANGe. But they decide to use the nasty part which is brown and white. COME ON? And u want customers to come back? I use to come here alot and the sushi chefs that make the sushi doesn't skim as much.

The pot stickers had way too many vegetables in them and the chicken teriyaki was nothing special to talk about.\n\nOver all, I should have just waited till dinner for Teriyaki.

Also, they sometimes give various \"on the house\" items such as mochi covered strawberries.\n\nI usually order Salmon Teriyaki and the size of the two salmon fillets have changed from large to small to large again. I think it may have to do with the varying size of their to-go containers. However, I love how they give you two fillets whereas other restaurants usually give you one. The Chicken Teriyaki consists of half dark meat and half white meat. Sometimes there's too many burnt edges for me to fully enjoy. The Chicken Kara-Age and Salmon Isobe-Age are pretty good as well. And I think their shrimp tempura have gotten smaller and smaller. I wouldn't recommend the udon here. You can get better tasting noodles and broth elsewhere for more or less, the same price. I like it when you order vegetable tempura, because they give you a variety of vegetables such as pumpkin, string beans, onion, broccoli, carrot, potato, and eggplant. Once I found a fly in my Spider Roll - bleck! It was delivery, so I couldn't really complain. Not to mention, I've had better, fresher Spider Rolls elsewhere.

It is ridiculous that parent cannot feed their child  homemade food.  The waiter told me they have kid's menu and I could order food for my son (which is 2 years old).  I asked him can he promise the food does not contain MSG which he ignored my question.  I requested to speak with the manager or the owner.  The waiter came back and said: \"This time we'll make an exception and let you eat here but we want to tell you our policy does not allow outside food.\" \n\nWho does this?! Outside food means bringing in a competitor's food (ie: McDonald's), but homemade food?? For a 2yr old!??! Please avoid this restaurant at all costs.", "author": "Pekkle p."}

Also, my co-worker is big guy who likes food, so he has a lot of experience in eating. \n\nAnyway...I always get the same thing here. The assorted sashimi... they shoud call it the assorted sashyummy. The assortment comes with three diff types of sashimi (three piece of each type = 9 pieces total, math wizards), and three fresh oysters! Plus a bowl of rice! Get ready for this... $14.99! Can you believe it? And the sashimi is fresh, firm and sweet. I've tasted bad preservative-doused-sashimi before, and this sashimi is oceans away from that. \n\nThe sushi rolls are the big, hunky type, not delicate, so it's good if that's what you're into. I recommend the chicken karage salad as well.

I forgot the name of the roll but it had spicy tuna on the inside with avocado and eel on top of it. I ate two pieces and had a stomach ache in the evening. I brought the leftovers home for my dad to eat. He ate it all and was in the bathroom and my grandma had to make him herbal medicine!

Food has always been passable; I have to be in a mood to settle. But I recently tried to place an order for a friend who has a shellfish allergy. All I wanted was to get the beef teriyaki + tempura combo, with no shrimp. The combo comes with harumaki (imperial rolls), which also contain shrimp. I asked for some small way to offset the lack of harumaki, maybe a piece or two of gyoza, which is the same price on the menu. It seemed like a reasonable request to me. The lady on the phone flat out refused to make any sort of accommodation for me. Sure she agreed to keep the tempura veggie only, but she refused to offset the loss of harumaki and shrimp with anything else. This restaurant would be saving money by not including those things in the meal, and they think it's okay to just shrug their shoulders and say \"hey, you have an allergy...sucks for you.\" NOT OKAY.

The area that the restaurant is located in seems more calmer than other restaurants. \nThe workers working there definitely deserve four stars because they are so friendly. I did not get anything special, just \"Chicken Teriyaki\". The reason being was because I was getting more for my money when I ordered the rice plate. It was $10 bucks for appetizer, miso soup, the main course, and then ice cream for dessert. Not bad at all. The food quality probably deserves 3 stars. There was not really anything special about it because the chicken teriyaki tasted like any other place. It was  kind of dry, but the teriyaki sauced balanced it out. They give you a good amount in terms of portions. I do want to come back here and try the sushi though. Overall this is a chill place.

I ordered the Chicken Katsu for $8.95 which included miso soup, salad, entree, rice, and ice cream after. \n\nQuality wise: so-so. The chicken katsu was not as tasty or seasoned as well as other Japanese restaurants. The meat is dry and the only reason there is a taste to it is because of the flavorful tonkatsu sauce that comes with it. They use a store bought vinaigrette type salad dressing with the salad. The ice cream is frothy and injected with air it seems. \n\nParking: not so great. It may take upwards of 10-15 minutes to find parking in a pretty busy area since there are so many restaurants and stores nearby.\n\nLarge parties: good. We had a large party of about 20 people and they have a room in the back open for reservations and bigger parties. Only downside to that room?

Which is good because it is usually stuffed with people and it is nice to have some room to breathe. \n\nI ordered Katsu-don($7.45) which is chicken cutlets cooked with egg and teriyaki sauce over rice along with a roll of Unagi Maki ($3.95). Now my friend told me a bit about my Katsu-don as we were eating. He said that this is a dish that Japanese cook as a simple meal when they are feeling lazy at home. I'm not sure if thats true but I really enjoyed it. The chicken cooked with egg and their sauce had a unique texture that was interesting to me. It was quite good, indeed!\n\nWe took our time eating and chatting in the corner with my friend. She came back to check on us a few times to leave us the bill and always said take your time with a smile. Happy staff = happy customers which was ME. \n\nI think its best when you go when it it less packed so the staff won't be so anal to you, which is around lunch time.

Being one of the only good sushi restaurants in the sunset district, it is a small place that has a good family vibe to it. The place can be a little pricey but they make up for that fact with giving you huge portions. Even with this said I know people are thinking quality over quantity but I can easily tell you that they put a lot of effort into everything that they make.\n\nThe choices of foods here are amazing... there are so many things to choose from it's insane! From combo dinners, to many different sushi rolls the thing I always get is either the Teriyaki Combination Dinner or the Grilled Seabass with Beef Teriyaki. Add along a sushi combination and you have yourself an amazing dinner! There are 3 different types of sushi combos to choose from so you have to decide for yourself what your in the mood for. The seabass here is to die for. Not only is it a fatty, flavorful fish but the tenderness of it can be matched by nothing else. The teriyaki combo has a little bit of everything including chicken, salmon, beef, and various other things. Everything was always cooked to order, everything was always fresh and it's nice to know that you can wipe your taste buds clean with a complimentary bowl of ice cream at the end.\n\nAll in all you can't go wrong with a family owned shop that people always come back to.

But honestly, I'd rather have tiny portions of DELICIOUS food than huge portions of the saltiest food I've ever had at a Japanese restaurant. \n\nI ordered Salmon wrapped in seaweed and deep fried, which in theory should be pretty decent, but they poured this thick ass cornstarch sauce all over it and made it soggy and too salty.  Their Salmon was very fishy, too, meaning it was not fresh at all.  I hate that more than anything.  When Salmon has that fishy taste, it really means you should THROW THAT STUFF OUT!  I only ate one piece of my order.  Their fried potato was good though.... Relative to everything else.\n\nI also tried some grilled Salmon which was also too salty, but I just wiped off all the sauce on the plate so it was bearable.  Then I tried the Chicken Karaage, which was pretty decent.  Although it tasted just like panko breaded chicken, so it was like chicken katsu to me.  Also had their spider roll, which was decent, but nothing exceptional.  \n\nSure, they give you miso, and salad, and ice cream, but the green tea ice cream was too creamy and did not taste enough like tea.

It's not as though there is a shortage of Japanese restaurants in The City.\n\nI had gone a few times because friends have wanted to go because it's in the neighborhood and we're too lazy to look for parking elsewhere.  I've sampled several of their dishes and was never really impressed.\n\nThings turned sour one night when I ordered the Chicken Karaage.  There were just six of us, the food was extremely slow to arrive.  (30+ minutes) Eventually everyone got their orders but me;  some time passes and I inquire about it's whereabouts.  A few minutes later, they bring out Chicken Katsu, not what I ordered but I tell them that it's fine and I'll take it anyway.  The waiter gets upset and snaps back (with lots of attitude) that it's the right order and that I was the one that is mistaken.  Not one to dwell on things, I finish my meal and we get our check.. \n\nInterestingly, there isn't a chicken katsu on there.  It's printed in plain english, k-a-r-a-a-g-e.  I point this out to our server and he just shrugs and throws the bill back on our table.  \n\nNot knowing what was going on, I paid for the additional cost of the karaage over the katsu and an additional cent for their trouble.\n\nNeedless to say, this place has landed on my boycott list.

Basically this is a Chinese run Japanese restaurant. The whole idea is pretty simple.  The general perception is that Japanese food is expensive so they just opened up a Japanese restaurant and charge people more money for their non authentic dishes. \n\nIt's kind of like you making up French names for your dishes that looks like french dishes and charge people more, because the general perception of French dishes are expensive.\n\nI also gotten sick one time after eating here.

It was reasonably fresh, the fish was cut ok, and the portions were normal.\n\nI went back again 2 weeks later, slightly before the dinner rush and I found the food to be abysmal. The sushi combo was obviously pre-cut getting ready for the rush, or was not that fresh. For example, the red tuna had \"extra\" red around the edges, ala Freezer burn style.\n\nThe slicing was not done well, every piece had connective tissue running lengthwise through it, meaning that you can not take a bite of half a piece of nigiri sushi because your can't cleanly cut through it.\n\nAt the end of the day sushi at it's most basic is just raw fish on rice. If I'm going to pay for sushi, I expect that the person making it has had at least some basic training, or hands on experience in how to slice the fish. Just pick fresh fish, and slice the right parts at the right angles! Otherwise I might as well buy a hunk of fish and start going at it like a sandwich!\n\nIf you are looking for lower price point sushi that isn't so hit and miss, try Kiki at 9th and Irving. It's even cheaper and arguably better fish.", "author": "Vic H."}

I figured we were overdue for a treat, and decided to splurge on delivery. \n\nHorrible experience. I can't say anything about the food, because I never even got that far. At 6:30 I ordered 3 items for delivery, and told the lady who took my order that I would be paying with a credit card She said \"Okay\" and hung up the phone. \n\nSo now it's 7:30, and my 5-year old and I are ravenous. The delivery guy shows up, and when I show him my card and ask for the slip, he says I need to pay with cash. I don't have cash on me, I explain, and offer to call the restaurant to clarify and have them run my card. The lady taking orders is now telling me that they can't run the card after the fact, and somehow I've got to magically pull some folding money out of thin air to get my dinner. When I again explained that I didn't have that option, she was not inclined in the slightest to help. She was like, your problem, lady. And then she hung up. I called back and got a man this time, and he actually tried to help, but the solution would have resulted in another half hour wait, and with cold food to boot. \n\nI'm impressed that this place is doing sooooo well that they can not only throw away money on a given night, but that they'd go a step further by ensuring (with cocky, \"I can't be asked to give a sh*t\" service) that folks won't order from them again. \n\nNoriega Teriyaki, y'all ain't the only Japanese delivery in the Sunset, not by any stretch of the imagination.  My advice to you is check your staff members who are acting like Dorsia maitre'd wannabes, and train them on how to write down a phone order. \n\nTake your Japanese comfort food cravings elsewhere, my friends.

I didn't have a problem with that really.  About 3/5 the way through eating my meal, one of the kids dropped a toy that rolled next to me so I turned around to pick it up and give it back.  That 20 seconds or so was enough for the ninja waitress to come in, snatch my plate of 3/5 consumed chicken katsu and run off with it.\n\nWhen I saw my plate was gone, I asked my fellow diners what happened to my dinner.  They said the waitress had collected everything because the other people in my group were done.  Who does that?  What kind of waitress collects a plate with food on it without asking?  I think even an waitress on her first day as a waitress wouldn't do that.  It kind of gave me the feeling they were trying to rush us out because we had been there for over 90 minutes which brings me to my next point. \n\nAfter we were seated, about 15 minutes goes by until someone even came to ask us about drinks or ordering.  After ordering, the food did not come out for about 45 minutes and there were only four people in our group.  So by the time we received our food, we had been there for about 1 hour.  We actually contemplated leaving because it was taking so long.\n\nWhen the waitress came back with ice cream, I asked her about my food.  She just shrugged and left the bill on the table.  I grudgingly paid the bill and only the bill, tips are for good service which was non-existent.  \n\nPaying my bill with my credit card was the last straw because when the transactions posted a few days later, my card was charged not once, not twice, but three times for the exact same amount.  I live about 1/2 miles away and I went back there at least 3 times to try to get the situation resolved no to avail.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-04-03", "description": "I've been going to this restaurant for years even when the restaurant was in it's original location. Typical Japanese restaurant, you know the usual, some Chicken Teriyaki dish, decent selection of rolls, Tempura, Udon etc... but by no means that's a bad thing.\n\nFood: Like I said typical Japanese restaurant. I've had most of their dinners, a lot of them are good, and they come in pretty good portions. Practically all will come with a salad, Miso soup, and ice cream at the end. So far I haven't had a problem with any of their dishes. The restaurant will on occasion have some unique sushi rolls that you won't find anywhere else, and that's always a plus. Appetizer's I usually skip mainly because you already get a soup with your meal.\n\nEnvironment/Setup: The location around the restaurant is basically in the middle on Sunset, not many other businesses around other than a few other restaurants a few blocks up, and a Walgreen's across the street. The restaurant is setup very simple and clean. First thing you'll notice is the tree in front of you as well as the sushi bar to your right. The main dinning room is setup very simple, tables and chairs along the sides with tables in the middle separated by partions. They have one separate room for parties although I never eaten in that room. Overall very simple.\n\nService: It's a mixed bag on this one. it's really hit or miss when it comes to service here. There were times where the service was bad. Usually it was because the restaurant was busy. It'd take a lot of effort to flag a waitress to your table. Also there were times where the sushi wouldn't reach our table until after we already received our dishes. Luckily this hasn't happen to me too often which is the reason I only docked off one star. Most times the service has been ok. Waitresses made sure we were ok, Sushi was made well, and I've talked to one-two of the chefs as well, cool people. \n\nParking/Price: Parking around this area is actually decent. Very few times I actually HAD to look for parking. Because there's other businesses around there is more parking, BUT after business hours theres not really other notable restaurant open around there so parking is relatively easy and no metered parking. Price for the meals is not bad for what you're getting. For dinner I usually grab one of the standard dinners, like chicken teriyaki or maybe some salmon. Most of the standard dinners around roughly like 9-10 bucks, and with most of the dinners (minus udon) you get some Miso soup, a salad, and ice cream at the end. so overall not bad, and the portions are relatively good sized too, never left hungry. Of course some dishes could use a little bit more work, but for the most part the dinners are good. When it comes to sushi, it really depends. Of course their standard rolls are good, I never had a problem. Of course I mentioned earlier that the restaurant does try new rolls on occasion some can be good but some can be bad as well. So it really depends on how bold you're feeling.\n\nQuick tips:\nTry NOT to go there during peak hours, it becomes really difficult to find a table and when you do the service takes a strong drop.\nThe food overall is good, there's isn't a huge selection of bento dishes though but the rest of the menu is good.\nIf you don't feel like driving there, the Muni practically has a stop right in front of the restaurant.\n\nOverall I do recommend Noriega Teriyaki, The service can deter people away, but if your smart about when you go, you'll be fine and you won't run into bad service. The prices are reasonable and the portions are generous, at times the service can be good, the sushi is fine, and it's really accessible to practically anyone.", "author": "Ryan C."}

I realized that this place isn't really as nice as it's made out to be . They have decent sushi at decent prices . I really like their spicy tuna roll .. it has just enough spice in it and its tastes so fresh ! The cherry blossom roll wasn't that good . The ny cheesecake is very good . They add whip cream , chocolate syrup & a cherry to it . It's perfect to finish off the meal . Not the best sushi but satisfactory . I would give this place 3 stars but because of how pretty the restaurant I'm give this place 4 stars . I swear .. this restaurant is very nice on the inside and they even have private rooms !

I wanted something in the neighborhood and my husband just wanted to eat.  Settled.  We've eaten here before and even walked away with one of those cute little ceramic cats they were giving away when you spent over fifty dollars.  I think we just went on a bad night and the vomit about three steps outside their door should have been a big ass red flag. We eventually got seated however, the waitress took about twenty minutes to actually get around to us. It was a Monday and there were only two waitresses working. Not their normal staff.  We ordered some sushi rolls, two dinners, and fried calamari.  It was the strangest meal I have ever had. Okay, not the strangest, but it does get an honorable mention. We got our cucumber salad but it didn't have the lemony dressing on it( i like the dressing) and soup, so it started out normal enough.  But then our dinner came.  Um, did they forget our sushi rolls and our calamari?  Nope.  The calamari came when we were halfway done with dinner and the rolls came when we were finished with our meal.  First of all, the calamari was awful. The batter thick and cakey and not what we expected.  We ordered wrong.  But by the time the rolls came, we were both full.  I hate leftover sushi. The rice gets hard and who wants day old seafood or avocado?  I couldn't eat more then two pieces and the rest the rolls i ordered went to waste.  My husband finished everything he ordered, except the calamari.  I guess it's safe to say that this will not be a regular haunt for us.  The food is just ok, but only if you're in the neighborhood, you don't want to drive anywhere else, or every other sushi joint is closed.
