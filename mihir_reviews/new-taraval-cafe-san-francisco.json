The ambiance is low key and welcoming with a radio quietly playing in the back, and friendly staff immediately making you feel at home.\n\nThe food is consistently good. One thing that stands out to me is that without exception, the avocados are always perfectly ripe. \n\nThe fresh seasonal fruit is cut individually per order, seconds before being served, a rare treat at any restaurant.\n\nIf you come here more than a few times wearing a smile , you'll probably be welcomed by name after not too long. Chatting with a fellow customer or one of the staff often turns into a lively conversation between many people. That being said, if you prefer  to eat and read in peace for a little while, the gentle background noise is exceptionally calming, and no one will bother you. Probably not a great place for laptop use however.\n\nIn summary, come here for consistent, simple delicious American breakfast food and a great small diner vibe!", "author": "Isaac G."}

I had read one previous review saying this place is full even at 7:16AM, so I was relieved when we had multiple tables to choose from. We ended up picking the Breakfast Special and the New Taraval Special. \n\nSomething great about the Breakfast Special was that it's only $6 because we came earlier than 9AM! I was going to order just the pancakes, but then I realized I could get eggs and sausage with my pancakes for the same price! The sausage was savory and not too oily, which was great for my still aching stomach! The eggs were fresh/thankfully not powdered, unlike in some restaurants. The pancakes were light, airy, and definitely filling! \n\nThe New Taraval Special is just like the Breakfast Special, but with French Toast instead. The French Toast was extra fluffy and soft! I'm glad it didn't taste too egg-y, like some French Toast can taste if dipped into the egg batter for too long. This entree was so huge, we ended up saving a third of it and taking it home! \n\nThis place is CASH ONLY, so make sure to bring some cash!! New Taraval Cafe has some quality food for a cheap price - we ended up spending $20 for the food plus tip for the two of us! This place is worth your time and money!", "author": "Liselle L."}

I was looking forward to the grill cheese but knew it would probably be American cheese which doesn't get me excited for a grill cheese. I was in question about the side because I could've just ordered the fries however. I've been wanting potato salad recent and it was one of the options. When my waiter came up he let me know what was in it and some other stuff that I didn't hear because I zoned out. He left and soon brought me back a sample size (nice size) of potato salad which was very nice considering. \n\nWhen my food finally arrived my grilled cheese could've been melted more. But there was plenty of avocado to over shadow that. I would just say... try and change the cheese to cheddar or Monterey Jack for some gooey stringyness. I'm sure everyone would love.

As for the surrounding neighborhood, what used to be post war, white middle class is now ethnically eclectic, but predominately Asian.  Times have changed, but the essence of this little diner has not.\n\nThe menu, predictable.  But the kitchen, as tiny as it was, puts out some outstandingly good food.  \n\nThe Hereford brand corned beef (one of only two brands I will accept from a can, btw) was elevated a notch by adding their own delicious potatoes, onion and a little more seasoning.  It became their own \"recipe\" and it was very good. \n\nThe Joe's Scramble was perfect.  Why is it so hard for other cafes get it right?  This one was well seasoned, using generous amounts of good tasting beef, resulting in excellent flavor.\n\nWant fruit instead of breakfast potato?  It may cost $1 to upgrade, but there is no denying, this fruit is fresh.  And the variety that goes into each serving is mind-boggling.  Freshly sliced pineapple, mango, grapes, pear, apple, orange, grapefruit, banana.\n\nMy coffee cup was the vessel for Farmer Bros coffee.  While not my favorite, it was not as weak as I remember.  I cannot complain as it was always a few sip away from being full.\n\nThe toast was slathered in real butter, thank you very much.  \n\nWith super-sized portions and low prices, this wins an medal for cheap but good eats.

It definitely has that small, casual diner atmosphere. There are a few booths, several small tables, and several bar seats. It seems to fill up quickly on weekends, as I waited in line for roughly 15 minutes before being seated, so definitely put your name on the sign-in sheet right by the door. \n\nAfter being seated, we waited another 20-25 minutes before getting our food. Given that this is a small place, it seemed like a long wait, but there is only one cook (and the flat top grill is right near the entrance so you can watch him as he cooks.) I wish the process could be somehow streamlined so that they could get orders out more quickly, but as it is, I would just recommend not coming here if you're in a rush. \n\nOn to the food - we ordered the country scramble and the steak and eggs, both with potatoes. The food is simple and hearty, and portions are very filling so you definitely get your money's worth. Overall our dishes were both well done, but if I had one gripe I would say I think the potatoes could be improved with more salt. They're pretty bland. However, I LOVE the crustiness they achieve, so I'm more than willing to season them myself (salt, pepper, hot sauce, sriracha, etc. are all available at each table and at the bar.) \n\nAnyway, this is a very solid neighborhood joint, perfect for when a greasy breakfast craving hits (or sweet - their pancakes and french toast looked pretty good too!)

Pretty sure it was an arbitrary number ($3), but we were fine with it since everything else is so cheap.\n\nMy favorite part was probably the fruit bowl.

I came here with a friend on a Monday morning, and most of the tables were full. You could tell that many were old customers by the way they greeted the staff. Service was efficient, even though there was only one lady bussing the entire floor. I also appreciated that there were condiments on very table (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/new-taraval-cafe-san-francisco?select=-XaLwPyowXV_the18EeTEA#cIPMXJFD2uguGMd_UGe4uA). \n\nFrench toast special with eggs and sausage:\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/new-taraval-cafe-san-francisco?select=-XaLwPyowXV_the18EeTEA#oc67PzUgpO6rbetMk5z6pg)\nBecause I'm such a sucker for French toast, I had to try it here. The lady also let me know that they had a special to go along with it, even though it wasn't listed on the menu. The eggs were cooked well, with the yolks still runny but whites cooked through. The sausages were mediocre, although I've never really been a fan of breakfast sausages. The French toast was generous in portion, and I really liked the texture, but the flavor was lacking. The coated eggs on both sides were done well, but it lacked any traces of vanilla extract, cinnamon, or nutmeg. I had two slices and used them mostly as toast to mop up the runny yolks of the eggs, but the French toast flavors were definitely lacking. \n\nBreakfast special with hotcakes, eggs and sausage:\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/new-taraval-cafe-san-francisco?select=-XaLwPyowXV_the18EeTEA#7CEo-3cmnaqIdlyl7ukdrQ)\nMy friend got the breakfast special with two hotcakes, and I think they were cooked well. They were quite fluffy and didn't leave that kind of sweetened-flour aftertaste in your mouth. The sausages were the same as the ones I had; not bad, but nothing memorable. The eggs were a little strange.. they were very rubbery in texture for some reason, and the whites weren't even cooked all the way through. We were both mystified by how they could be so rubbery, but it wasn't so bad that it was inedible. \n\nThis is a quick, hassle-free little place to stop by for a quick breakfast, but it's not somewhere I would specifically take someone.", "author": "Maggie X."}

The portions are large, the service is friendly, and they remember who their return customers are.\n\nThey are cash only, but their prices are really low.

This spot serves delicious breakfast all day and lunch items such as burgers and sandwiches. I tried the corned beef hash and it was different than anywhere else I have tried it. It was delicious and nope, none of that canned stuff. Another item on the menu I have to rave about is the french toast! Enough egg soaked in soft toast. You can add your desired amount of cinnamon yourself! I'm excited and looking forward to come back next time for some good breakfast food.

For some reason this place reminded me of M's Cafe (the original owned version)! And M's Cafe was my spot to go to without bumping into anyone I know, to just feel 'out of town'.\n\nSo when I came here for the first time it was very nostalgic to me, hah, from the prices to the portions and cafe being run by a cute asian family really brought back memories of M's.\n\nI came with the husband, there were a good two party in front of us; the gentleman over the counter made sure he acknowledged us and let us know the approximate wait time (10-15mins) which isn't bad at all for a SUNDAY BRUNCH. So we waited against the wall which has a clear view of the stove top where their dad?, I'm pretty sure it was, and the host's brother on the other half of the grill flipping hash browns and pancakes. I was definitely entertained on how fast they were moving and how smooth everyone (a good 5 of them) flowed in the little area they called a 'kitchen'. BRAVO! \n\nThe show continues when we got seated at their 'bar' area where we now moved the show from the grill to the bar, I love watching them cook and work together; so we also got to view the busser and runner of how they garnish plates and serve drinks so quick!\n\nI ordered their 'house special' which was like $5-$6, came with two pancakes, two eggs (any style), and bacon or sausage. Tasted very similar as well, it was good; pancakes were ultra fluffy and NOT DRY (which is a big plus for me).\n\nI will definitely come back when I'm in need of American style breakfast/lunch again!

They also have a lot of other breakfast options to choose from that are also relatively cheap. They provide a larger portion of sides if you want to get potatoes or fruit (not included in the special). I have tried a lot of bacon in my day and I would say the bacon here is delicious. It's not overly greasy but has a nice bit of crispiness to it, which I love. My wheat toast was nicely buttered and went so well with sunny side up eggs.

Unfortunately I found out, neither is their corned beef hash and eggs. The corned beef was rather bland, the eggs well were eggs and their English muffins tasted generic. For the hash part of this dish I prefer my potatoes shredded and made like hash brown, New Tara's come chunky.\nThe service was a bit abrupt. I asked for a receipt and what I got was blank ordering check with just the amount written on it, no logo, no name, no what was served, just the amount.

It's run by a local Chinese family -- the mom will often take your order, the sister will refill your coffee, and you can witness the brother(s) and dad cooking away on the hot open grill upon entrance. It is cheap, delicious, and homey - all in the most un-ironic way possible. \n\nIt's not a Dottie's, a Mama's, or a Brenda's, and you certainly won't even wait a small fraction of what you'd be enduring to snag a table at any of those places on a weekend. Though it may be more comparable to a Mel's Diner or a Denny's in terms of the genre of food, the freshness and dirt-cheap prices definitely set them apart from the aforementioned diner-chains. They range from $3 simple egg/meat platters to $6-$7 hefty omelette dishes that come with a stack of toast and endless jelly packets.\n\nAside from the wallet-friendly price points, the food is simple - not fussy, hot, and delicious. My personal favorites are the corned beef hash or their Italian sausage omelette. Most of their plates come with a heaping brick of fluffy crispy hash browns and a plate of English muffin slices or toast triangles, and everything hits the spot when you're hankering for some simple, quick, egg-meat-and-potatoes American or Irish-style breakfasts.\n\nTrue, it's not quite a destination in an ever-so-gentrifying city that embraces its bourgeois-foodie frou-frou culture more than ever.

She waits on tables, he cooks the food.  Prices are cheap, portions are generous and the service is very efficient.  She refilled my cup of coffee countless times (the coffee wasn't so good but I didn't expect it to be).  Yes, they have counter seating and vinyl booths...but they also have a Chinese shrine.\n\nA corned beef hash breakfast with eggs, toast and your choice of bacon, sausage or ham is $6.  They have Irish sausage and pudding.  They're probably known for their breakfasts but they also have burgers, steak, and sandwiches (including teriyaki ones). \n\n* New Taraval special $6.25. Two eggs served your way, hash browns, your choice of bacon, ham or sausage, and buttered toast.  Very solid.  The golden hash browns were slighty crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  The sausages (4 links) were good quality, firm, juicy and flavorful.  Even the toast was nicely toasted (not too much, not too little).  Eggs were poached properly.\n\nThe place looks old and feels a little sticky.  The pictures on the wall are faded.  But, they're serving up good diner food at good prices.

Looks like I had no opinion in the matter. Cool! All I wanted was to avoid food poisoning so trying it out was not problem. \n\nWe walked in and found the place bustling.

An old Asian lady with a bowl-cut hair style -- who I believe to be the proprietor -- seated us in one of the red booths. She wore an apron, pink sweater, and a joking attitude on her face. When a pair of elderly patrons were leaving, she told one of them, \"Thank you, young lady\" and the patron retorted \"You must not see very good,\" to which she just wholeheartedly laughed it off and continued to complement on her non-existent youthful appearance. The patron left the restaurant smiling. \n\nI ordered an Irish Breakfast and coffee and the Girlfriend ordered french toast. When I hear the Girlfriend's order, I thought she must of been joking because, from my perspective, it seemed to be a small order for just breakfast. I tried to order more food off the menu, but she stopped me. Apparently the food portions are huge here. She was right. \n\nWhen the Girlfriend's french toast came, I was very surprised. It came on top of an oval plate with four large pieces of said french toast, but also generous portions of sunny side up egg, sausage, ham, and butter. My meal was even larger. It had two sunny side up eggs, large amounts of home fries, irish sausage, ham, more ham - or what I thought was ham- (God, I wish I had taken pictures), and buttered toast on the side - all for nine bucks! \n\nThe meal was decent. One can't complain too much because the price is so low for what they give you ( Hey, at least the silverware looked polished). The sausage tasted weird, but maybe it's because I'm not used to the taste of 'Irish' meat. The server came around three times ( I believe he is the son of the proprietor ) and gave me more rounds of coffee. All in all, it was a good experience for me and I'd recommend anyone to drop by and have a meal at New Taraval Cafe.", "author": "Kimbo L."}

Predictably, the Outer Sunset has fewer, and the neighborhoods they are situated in tend to lack the vibrant atmosphere of their eastern counterparts.\n\nNew Taraval Cafe is probably the best one I've encountered west of 19th ave.  The food is roughly on par with what you'd find at Art's on Irving Street, and the prices are around $8 per plate.  \n\nMy favorite item on their menu is the Italian sausage with eggs.  They serve it with either hash browns or chopped fruit, and I switch between them on a weekly basis.  \n\nThe 20th and Taraval corridor is not particularly handsome or inviting, but there are plenty of other businesses to peruse, should you get the urge to walk off that 10:00 am grease bomb you just ingested.  \n\nThe proprietors have a quirky sort of abrupt manner to them that is neither welcoming nor rude.  It's as though they've reconciled themselves to the fact that people aren't really in here for the pleasant atmosphere.  \n\nA large framed picture of the Three Stooges playing golf adorns the wall behind the counter.

This dish has it all (except for the Irish soda bread). Two eggs, cooked any style, Irish bacon, sausages, both black and white pudding, home fried potatoes, and your choice of toast. Yeah, that's a LOT of food. This meal is not for the faint of heart (or those with heart conditions).\n\nThe other breakfast I like to order here is the BLT & egg on toast. You can't go wrong with a fried egg sandwich and this one really satisfies. Comes with NTC's signature home fried potatoes.\n\nIn addition to breakfasts, this cafe also offers a lunch selection. I wish I could tell you more about their lunch menu but, unfortunately I only order lunch from them on Thursdays. Now here is where we get to the part where those of you who have read this far into my review learn the secret of New Taraval Cafe. Lean in closer. Closer...\n\nEvery Thursday, this Mom & Pop operation roasts a whole turkey and then carves it up to make the best damn turkey club sandwich I have ever eaten. This is not an item on the menu. You have to hear about it word of mouth... and now you have. \n\nMake sure you get your club sandwich before noon. They only cook one turkey and those sandwiches go FAST. Order their potato salad on the side with that sandwich. It's the perfect accompaniment.\n\nIn closing, when I say Mom & Pop, I MEAN it. The couple who run this place ask me where I've been when I don't show up on a regular basis. It's a good feeling to know that your patronage is appreciated that much.", "author": "Rory O."}

I phoned in an order for:\n\n-two $3.95 breakfast special with 2 hotcakes, eggs and sausage or bacon\n-two corned beef hash with eggs\n-one ham, egg, and sausage breakfast\n\nThe woman who took my order was ON IT. She repeated everything back to me, told me to come by in 10 minutes and my total super quickstyle. I got there about 15 min later and sent the hubby in to pick up the order as I waited, illegally parked (parking is difficult), in the car. He went in and immediately came back out with our orders.\n\nThe hotcakes were totally awesome - the perfect balance of fluffiness and denseness to soak up the syrup. My bacon was not overcooked (I hate overcooked bacon!) and tasted oh so yummy also drenched in syrup. The scrambled eggs were also done perfectly as they came on top of the hotcakes but did not run one bit. The other orders also looked great. I tried my hubby's corned beef hash and I wanted to eat his breakfast as well! The best part was that I ate up my entire breakfast, plus a half of a hotcake that my mom didn't eat and at the end, I didn't feel at all nasty, like I just ate at a IHOP or Denny's.\n\nTerrific, fast service. Yummy American breakfast. Good-sized portions for the money. Overall, a great place to scratch that lazy Sunday afternoon itch for a coma-inducing brunch that will make you want to be lazy for the rest of the beautiful San Francisco day.", "author": "Dawn L."}

The food is great n cheap, but I already told the owner that my egg was undercooked the last few times I was there. The cook did cook it thoroughly when I told them that and I thought they would fix that problem the next time I came back. I see he undercooks all eggs whether its an omelette or scrambled when I am waiting in line to be seated. There's definitely a safety concern when you undercook eggs, with a chance of getting salmonella or the stomach virus, like I did. Anwyays, I know the family works hard n the food does taste great. But I think I'm going to stay away from this place for awhile. Hadn't had a stomach ache for couple months prior to eating here and now my stomach is super sensitive and upset all the time.

Being a small family run business I always tend to go to places like these over the big chains. The place is relatively small compared to other places and can seat around 30 at most but it's a nice cozy atmosphere inside with a lot of regulars who come and go. The owners act as cook and waitress so it's really easy to get to know them after a few visits and they are super friendly as well. One thing I can say is that after coming here for years this is still the place to be.\n\nThe menu can be a little limited to those with big aspirations in wondering what to eat but the thing to get is the Breakfast Special. Comes with 2 eggs, 2 bacon or sausage, and toast with an addition charge if you want to add hash potatoes. It has a nice home cooked feeling to it and it's just simply amazing for under 4 bucks. Another thing to try is their bacon cheeseburger. I know, I know there are so many other places out there where you can get a burger but I like this place more having nice quality along with it.\n\nIf your feeling more adventurist then go for the hamburger steak with onions or mushrooms. That'll get you going for a great lunch. If that's not for you than the overwhelming Denver Omelet is ever so filling as well.

They make it just like my mama's and anyone who can make french toast like my mom's wins a special spot in my heart. This place is ran by a family-- parents own it and the daughter/mother takes orders and serves while the two brothers and father do all the cooking.

Sadly, this place, while better than M's, didn't meet them.\n\nOn the plus side, it's very cheap. If one is on a strict budget, but desires to eat out, New Taraval Cafe could fill that niche quite nicely. We expect a little more, though, and the slightly greasy food wasn't the most appealing to us. The menu itself is fairly standard, which isn't a bad thing when you want a cliched American breakfast (or Irish breakfast) as we did, but it doesn't lend the place to being very memorable.\n\nOverall, we don't plan to come back here.

One look from the outside and I was ready to head for the hills, but I went against my instincts and took the plunge.  I saw a cop was in there, which helped me put my mind at ease because cops know where all the good food is.  I got two eggs, four sausage links, wheat toast, and hash browns for $6.  Food was typical diner quality food, no surprises there.  What did surprise me was when I asked for water, the guy opened a refrigerator from the 80s (one of those old white ones). He went to get ice from the ice tray and he used his bare hands!  He didn't wash his hands first either!  Then as I was moving my plate, I felt the bottom of the plate was extremely greasy.  It seemed clean enough on the top, but it made me wonder how well they actually clean their dishes.  Really nice staff, though.\n\nAfter I finished my food, I saw the sign that said the day's special was three pieces of french toast, two eggs, and two sausage links or pieces of bacon for $6.  I wish I would have seen that first...I would have probably gotten that instead.\n\nAll in all, not a horrible place.  There's some health code concerns, but no more than any other diner.

But I did... I came in for breakfast and I was disgusted at the sticky tables they sat us in, and the horrible customer service. Asking if we could switch to a booth maybe, they said \"no\" and walked away. No explanation. Nothing. We were sat all the way in the back of the restaurant, by the restroom which was unpleasant, and there were dirty buckets on the ground around us. Gross. Not only that but there are huge horse flies flying around us in the back of the restaurant. That is never a good sign. Huge flies like that mean they are feeding off rotting SOMETHING, which I don't even want to know what. The waitress comes to ask us if we want something to drink, and she sees the flies and has the nerve to say to us, \"OH YOU BROUGHT FLY IN.\" No bitch, we didn't bring horse flies in with us. I wish the health inspector was here.\n\nSo trying to be optimistic, I think, \"okay the menu is cheap so thats good.\" I decided to order an omelette with sausage and avocado. Simple enough right? Last time I checked... an omelette always has cheese. Thats what makes it an omelette and not just scrambled eggs right? Wrong. I had to ask for cheese. And I had to pay extra for it. Oooookay? They better at least know what theyre doing. \n\nWaiting... waiting... waiting... one persons order comes out... waiting... waiting... another order comes out... waiting some more... \"HEY! Wheres my order? My friends are halfway through theirs!\" I notice them stop eating and open their omelettes. Raw egg. Really? Oh and the cheese was one slice of kraft singles. Really not looking forward to my plate coming now... As my plate comes, my friends complain that their egg is raw. She flips it open with her HANDS, and says to us, \"NO ITS NOT.\" What the fuck? Don't argue with the customers, especially when its blatantly raw and translucent.  I open mine as they are telling her the problem, mine is raw as well. And the slice of kraft singles is sitting there, unmelted. Wow. She didn't even take them back. \n\nWe all look at each other like, \"are you kidding me?\" We try the hashbrowns. Which need salt. And ketchup. We open the ketchup... the color looks weird. Wait, why is it watery? \n\nYes, every condiment was even watered down to the point where ketchup had the consistancy of tabasco sauce. \n\nI have never wanted to walk out of a restaurant more without paying.

Forget the crappy service and second-rate burgers at highly-touted places like Barneys, because the Irish burger just cannot be beat. What makes this the most delicious burger in town is a handmade, well- seasoned beef patty and perfectly cooked sauteed mushrooms and onions. The mushrooms and onions are perfectly al dente, and they never fry them into a black, soggy oblivion like most burger joints do. It does not hurt that they may be cooked in a butter and crack-cocaine sauce either, but seeing mushrooms on a burger that have not been totally murdered is new and refreshing indeed. All this is topped off with a couple of slices of tender Irish bacon (a.k.a. ham) and white American cheese. The fries are hearty and perfectly cooked too. \n\nIf you are not in the mood for a burger, the breakfast has a lot going for it too. From the everything-under-the-sun Irish breakfast to simple eggs and home fries, New Taraval knows how to put together a simple and delicious breakfast with no thrills or B.S. After living in the Mission for two years, I have really come to appreciate the hipster-free environment at NT, and being served by the older couple that own the joint beats the hell outta having slop thrown at you by the dirty, hungover a-hole \"servers\"  at St. Francis Fountain or any of the Mission's sorry ass excuses for diners. It is worth the drive every time. Greasy spoon? Check. Friendly, fast service? Check. Real home-cooked food? Check. Douchenozzle-hipster-free environment? Check.

Counter sittings, booths for two for four and a table in the back for more than the booths can hold, this little diner didn't seem too small after all.\n\nLooking though the menu was easy when I saw $3.95 breakfast combo, which consist of two eggs, two slices of toast or hotcakes, and two slices of bacon or sausage links. And I believe that it's slightly more expensive after 10ish. A note about the coffee though; it was a little weak, but the cup is never empty thanks to the constant refills!\n\nAnyway, didn't take too long before my breakfast came. The hotcakes pretty much took up half the plate and my over-easy eggs had to rest its egg whites on one side of the hotcakes. For the price, the quality is impressive. \n\nThe eggs were...like any other eggs, but the interesting thing is that most other breakfast places that does over-easy tend to leave the yolk with a thin layer. This set of eggs had the look of a fully cook egg, but when I got to the yolk, it was over-easy. Another plus, the fork I used didn't puncture the yolk. Of course, I'll say more about it if there was consistency after every order. \n\nThe hotcakes weren't super fluffy, but they weren't under cooked either. Quite enjoyable to the last bite. \n\nSausages...well, it's sausages. \n\nGood thing about this place that I learned to appreciate is the Mom-and-Pop feel of it. The thought that when folks come in for a meal and the staff remember your name is a dying culture all thanks to chain restaurants. Even so, I'm sure you'll be fairly delighted to dine here when you can't argue with the price and quality.", "author": "Jeremy L."}

It's a morning and mid-day only place.  \n\nIt's run by Mary and Tony, a husband and wife team, with the grill right by the front door, and traditional 5 seat bar with shakey stools. Tony blasts egg and pancake and potato orders out super fast, and while we haven't ever tried the full black and white irish breakfast because we're just not that brave, we're always happy with the super cheap breakfast special when we can drag ourselves in before 10am. It's something crazy like 2 egg, 2 pancakes, sausage, bacon, toast and coffee for $3.95. Everything is reasonably priced. I've never been able to finish what I order, even with giving away my pork products to tablemates. \n\nThe soft, fluffy and not-chewy pancakes could do with some real maple syrup, but it tastes like diner pancakes with the basic maple flavored variety. The home fries are really tasty and could be a meal on their own. At Magnolia Cafe in Austin, they are. My eggs are always cooked to order, just right - over medium. The coffee is diner coffee. Nothing fancy here. \n\nThe service is usually super fast, if a little nonchalant. Mary keeps coffee cups full and brings refills on OJ. There is a big table at the back for large groups, but mostly best for parties that fit into a booth.", "author": "Char Z."}

They are not cheap when it comes to portions.\nService has always been good along with a friendly attidude. She greats everyone with a big\" Good Morning\" as you walk through the door.There are many regulars who eat there on a daily basis.They are from all ethnic backgrounds and walks of life. Young and old alike I have never seen an unhappy customer.\nThey prepare a roast turkey that is wonderful.Again the portions are big and the food is fresh. I have tried most items on the menu  and found nothing which I did not like.\nAnyone who I have ever taken there has truly enjoyed their meal. The also ask me how long has this place been there for.

Taraval Cafe.\n\nWhen you walk up to the door, you wonder whether you are walking into a massage parlor or a diner, since the window has some sort of tint covering and the exterior decor is non-existent. They have a long counter in front of the grill and a few booths on the side.\n\nWe were seated at a booth and were by far the youngest people there (by a good 40 years or so). This place caters mostly to \"regulars\" since it seemed like the waitress/owner knew everyone's order. I ordered the breakfast special for $3.95. It contains two eggs, two slices of bacon/sausages, and two hotcakes. I also ordered the much-ballyhooed home fries ($1.50) and a cup of OJ. The OJ came quickly and was obviously from a carton, but I expected that. The order came soon after. The eggs were nice and runny, the bacon was pretty thick, and the hotcakes looked appetizing. You get what you order. Don't expect them to add anything special to their hotcakes or have any special cuts of bacon. The home fries came on a separate plate. They were nice and warm, but I would have preferred it to have more time on the grill to give it more than the smashed potato texture that was part of every bite. There were slices of onion running through the home fries and didn't contribute much to the overall flavor of it.\n\nYou basically get what you ask for. When the menu says eggs, hotcakes, and bacon, you are going to get eggs, hotcakes, and bacon. If you need a cheap, reliable breakfast, this is your place.
