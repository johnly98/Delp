I've known the owners ever since I was 4 (17 years) and they make the best Won Ton soup. If you want food catered they have great prices just make sure to inform them at least a month in advance. \nOn top of that they have a variety of food with huge portions. If it's your first time here or if you are a regular, \nI recommend to GET THE \n-Honey Walnut Shrimp (crunchy, flavorful, and soft on inside/ cooked perfectly with great sauce and real walnuts and honey)\n-Salt & Pepper Pork Chops (tender on the inside, crispy on the outside, not that oily or too salty)\n-Hong Kong Style Noodles (has vegetables and every meat imaginable with shrimp, this is worth it)\n-Wor Wonton Soup Combination (same as the HK style noodles, has everything and great taste)\n\nTip:\n-it gets busy in the noon time, try to come here for dinner or much earlier. \n-be patient with the customer service, it's a family owned business and she's getting old, really come here for the great food\n-bring friends, you won't be able to finish 3 of the items I just listed by yourself, I recommend bring 3 or more people, everyone chips in about $10\n\nThis place really is a gem in SF and if you stumble upon a place like this you my friend are very lucky!", "author": "AJ M."}

It was really easy to call in the day before, and they can work with you on the amount of food. When they say enough for one person, they make the assumption that's all their eating. So if you order noodles for 15 people, you're literally getting enough noodles to fill 15 people up. \n\nI worked with them to make vegan noodles (rice noodle chow mien with no egg), as we had a vegan attending. It was cooked pretty well, and was very filling. \n\nSalt and Pepper Chicken wings: they're really good, but you need to eat them fast. Or maybe I needed to open the tin foil so it didn't steam. The fry is a little more like a thick batter (think beer batter). The chili peppers were delicious.\n\nMixed Veggies: I did say we had a vegan, right? They were really nice at figuring out how to make this one more substantial, and ended up adding tofu in the mix.\n\nOverall, it was a pretty easy process. We had a ton of leftovers, though people were happy to take the rest. It's one of the best Chinese food spots on the Ocean Avenue corridor. \n\n\nAgain, might be bias because I spoke to the owner in Chinese, and she kind of knew who I was because of her children. But. I do have to say it was easy even before I mentioned I knew their kids.", "author": "Lily W."}

This is the typical mom and pop business with family members helping out in the back. We ordered Pork Chops and Ong Choy which came with soup and rice. The owner is very nice and will make you feel like you're at home. For the regulars, the owner will remember everyones orders, I would never need to look at the menu when I eat here. I also noticed the owner will go out of her way to the grocery store next door to buy ingredients that they ran out for a customers dish. That is dedication right there for the loyal customers.

That was the place I would take my shoes off, wear someone's ugly sweater, drink some random soupy medicine stuff I'm forced to drink lest I die a premature and painful death before laying on the sofa with the \"clink clink\" sound of MJ tiles on the tables lulling me to sleep before waking to an abundance of lovingly cooked food on the dinner table. \n\nThe meals I have had here transported me to that place. Certain types of home style cooking does that to me. Interestingly enough, this isn't my home, and these wonderful people aren't my family. \n\nMy photographs speak to what I ordered. It was really affordable despite ordering ala carte instead of their inexpensive pre-set menus for groups of 2 or 4. \n\nThis isn't a fancy restaurant by any means. The food will not resemble mass produced gross Panda Express or Westernized watered down weird versions of Chinese food. No, this restaurant does it the way it should be done. \n\nI like that. I like that a lot \n\nDON'T ORDER THE WON TON SOUP! It wasn't good, which makes me sad because the owner gave us an extra family sized bowl while we waited for the whole fried fish. \n\nI'm so happy I found this place. I am happy I got to enjoy a delicious dinner with my girls. I think we all need to find that one place that we can sit down and eat a fuss free meal that makes us feel ...like home. \n\nMy initial visit was for family dinner.

All of the patrons were Chinese, so I figured this was a great place. I was completely ignored, so I sat myself at a vacant table. I noticed first off, that the table was sticky and filthy, and looked like it had never been truly disinfected or really cleaned. The grouchy older Chinese lady, who was waiting tables came over and said, \"One?\", and I replied yes. She gave me a dirty look and stormed away, wiping another table with a dirty rag!! \n\nI began to look at the condiments on the table in a basket.

The one you'll pickup on the way home from after a long Monday at work, or on Saturday night when you're just lounging around in your pajamas and don't feel like cooking or changing out of your pajamas. \n. \nGolden China is exactly that type of restaurant. However, it isn't mine. I's my grammas who lives right up the street. \n\nBack in the days, If she wasn't home cooking some Flip food, she'd pickup some house special chow mein for me and my little cousins. I can't remember how the chow mein was back then, but I can say that their chow mein now is super good. So good that I didn't get a chance to take a pic of the takeout I brought back to her. I did get a picture of their beef chow fun which was on point. http://static3.px.yelp.com/bphoto/PEf6wA25C9ioyy8EmEQCKQ/l It wasn't to greasy, the noodles had a good texture and still very hot from the walk back.

After the fire next door and their remodeling, I returned to order the nostalgic bliss I experienced before.  Sadly, things have changed for the worse. \n\nThe main Hostess knows me.  Amidst all Staff, she's the most 'fluent' one.  She also recalls my herbivorous needs and preferences even now.  I ordered my usual mixed veggie w/ shiitake  mushrooms over rice plate. Very generous with all ingredients and doesn't exceed $6. I also reordered a specialized request of hot and sour soup, made w/ no meat or meat broths/remnants.  This time, the soup made me sick to my stomach. \n\nWoke up 4 hours after ingestion singing the soup to the potty.  Returned the next morning to inform the Hostess.  Kindly let her know w/o accusations of using rotten ingredients while also complimenting her about the rice plate, then and now, as its never nauseated me.  Still, got scolded by her and the Fry Cook as though I'd accused them of using spoiled ingredients.  Got put on stand like I was at trial and battered w/ how 'No other customers got sick or made complaints.' I reminded her likely none of their customers are herbivores and ever makes custom requests to that liking. I repeated myself about how the dish didn't make me sick, only the soup. They insisted they put 'tofu and no meat.'\n\nThe restaurant is small and by the cash stand in the back, you can look right into the kitchen.  I don't doubt they use 'relatively' fresh ingredients but when I see a large can of powdered chicken stock (likely loaded w/ MSG) right next to the stoves, I also know their raw ingredients are showered w/ other processed, unnatural flavorings.  Who am I to complain though?  I came back, right?  Well, I only complain when I'm up at 2am hollering into the toilet.  \n\nUltimately, Hostess was nice enough to refund me for the soup despite her and the Fry Cook's bickering and resistance to apologize or simply offer reconciliation.  Not too surprising as all the Staff are essentially peasants w/ limited English.", "author": "Honest J."}

Based on first impressions, I was not disappointed with what I saw. It is very clean and very quiet. The menu itself looked decently priced but then we can't really say until we see what the actual finished product comes out to be. The 3/$18.99 menu was very limited. There were maybe a little over 10 items to choose from, all which sounded like hit or miss dishes. My sister and I ended up picking the seafood tofu, Szechuan sauce with chicken, and Mongolian beef. The  time it took to get our food was maybe 15 minutes which was not bad. The food came out piping hot. When we got home to try the food, I was a little disappointed in the portions we received. They appeared to be nice and full but the seafood tofu was 90% tofu, the Szechuan chicken was 50% chicken/50% onions, and the Mongolian beef was in a measly takeout box.\n\nAll in all, I would definitely consider eating here more and sampling more of their menu. They have tons of specials that do not sound half bad. My advice would be to just try sitting as far away as you can from the cash register because the meat freezer seemed to be just a few feet back from there.", "author": "Alex T."}

I stumbled across this place walking home from the bank.\n\nInitial Reaction: Standard Chinese restaurant, nothing to get excited or complain about. I do sense a bit of humidity, which is probably due to the steam from the kitchen. This could explain why it feels sticky on the table and/or condiments. \n\nServices/Food Purchased: I purchased Bittermellow with Spare Ribs on white rice. \n\nTime of Service: Very fast, well within standard expectations\n\nCustomer Service: There was nobody there when I first walked in. The ladies didn't speak English very well and handed me a menu. Again, standard Non native English speaker service. It wouldn't be fair to compared them to a big box American restaurant in terms of service, but then again you're there for the food. \n\nValue: I paid 7 dollars for my meal. The portion was good and the food tasted fresh. It's neither expense or budget friendly. \n\nMy 2 Cents: This is a standard Chinese restaurant. The service is OK (you would need to flag them down if you want help or service), the place looks OK and nothing really exciting about their menu. What I would say is that their cooking is authentic and I wouldn't mind going there again. I wouldn't make a special trip just to eat there however.

Lunch specials start at $4.75 and dinner specials start at $5.25.  I've stuck with the specials and combination plates and I have never spent more than $13 (without gratuity) for two people.  Everything is affordable here.\n\nPortions: the portions are extremely generous.  I can eat far more than the average person so if I think the portions are generous than I'd say you would too. \n\nTaste: everything I've tried has been good although nothing really stands out.  The past couple of times the fried rice has lacked that oily component you find in most fried rice dishes - but this is a good thing.  I thought the Mongolian beef had too many vegetables and not enough beef.  \n\nService: the service is definitely on the slow side.  There is usually only one person waiting on all the tables and they're constantly filling to go orders.  You have to be patient and prepare yourself for a wait.

(so it is a lot easier to bring someone who knows how to speak chinese sometimes)\n\nthey also may not LOOK great aesthetically, but this is not what this place is all about. its about the cheap prices and good food that they serve. they also give you HUGE portions where a 6foot dude like me cant even finish. \n\nlastly, this place is family owned so the cooks are family and the workers are all family there. so don't be intimidated by the way they treat you, thats how chinese people are with family, not always the nicest lol.", "author": "Kenny L."}

(personally i dont like dining in or getting take-out at dirty hole-in-the-wall places even if the food is great.) yes it does have a strange odor, but i attribute that to the funky chinese ingredients they use that's imported from china like black mushrooms, herbs and dried seafood. ;) i chit-chat with the owner every time i go in and she's fairly nice if you try to get to know her. she even gave me some of the yummy soup they cooked for their employees lunch. ;)", "author": "p f."}

It was for sure spicier than usual but my main complaint was the taste of the sauce.  Mongolian beef is suppose to be darker but the one we had was a little lighter as if it had BBQ sauce on it.  But the taste was like it was mixed with Jalape\u00f1os and Ketchup! What on earth! Why does my Mongolian beef taste like ketchup? But a friend said it was Hoisin Sauce.

My family and I have been dining here since 2002. The old lady is nice and has been there forever. Their prices are so frikin cheap and the portions are huge. I usually get the \"A\" combo which I highly recommend. (Chow mein, sweet and sour pork/chicken, and 2 pieces of fried shrimp). They're extremely fast at getting your dish out right after you order (about 5 minutes). Or like I do, you just order 10 minutes ahead, so by the time you come in for take out (or dine in) the food'll already be ready. If she's familiar with you, she'll know your dish right when she see's you or even by calling to order, she'll recognize your voice and already know what you want to order. The place is not all that clean but it's balanced out by the food quality and the prices. There's like 2 spaces of side parking available but you can always park in the Walgreens parking lot right next store to the restaurant. Unless your unusually pick, you'll enjoy it. Definitely a place I'd recommended. I used to eat there 3 to 4 times a week, no lie, but due to the recession....well, you know the rest. =)", "author": "Aaron F."}

Let me tell you: I feel like I ate 13 dollars worth of food that I would at an upscale restaurant. The portions are rediculously huge for such a rediculously low price. And the food is damn good too!", "author": "Chris P."}

They had no problem making my chicken and vegetables without oil, and it tasted much healthier than other chinese places I've been to. The perfect topping when I got home for a spinach salad.", "author": "Jason B."}
