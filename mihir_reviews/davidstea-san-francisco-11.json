It was founded in Montreal almost a decade ago by yes, Canadians, who must have seen a gaping hole in the market for tea-totaling Canucks. Apparently they don't all guzzle beer up north. They swept southward into our country about six years ago, and Oprah suddenly promoted them about four years ago. Well, that sealed the deal since her endorsement is the retail equivalent of the golden fleece. And the rest, as the French Canadians say, is histoire.\n\nJamie W. and I happened upon the one in the Westfield food court as we've been in a heavy tea mode of late. It definitely has the packaged look of a chain that paid a lot for image consultants. The ritzy Tiffany blue of the sign, the tea cups and even the tea tags attest to that. Dozens of uniform canisters were neatly organized on shelves behind the counter organized by what kind of tea (photo: http://bit.ly/2pI2Bzo). Perky staff were more than willing to allow us to smell any tea to which I showed even the slightest curiosity.\n\nAfter much staring, Jamie settled on the Mint Chocolate, and I got sassy and ordered the Sweet Ginger Heat (photo: http://bit.ly/2raw6v1). At a not unreasonable $3.50 a cup, both were satisfying with mine having a little bite that I welcomed. There is plenty of designer merchandise to peruse while you wait for your tea to steep (photo: http://bit.ly/2qd6sYM), though nowhere to sit. That meant we had to sit among the lobster-gorging, cream puff-devouring patrons out in the court. It was a calorific jungle out there, but we survived.\n\nTEA - 4 stars...rich tea flavors, endless variety available\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...it's just a store with a lot of color-coordinated merchandise\nSERVICE...3.5 stars...they're a happy lot in here, must come with the training\nTOTAL - 4 stars...Oprah was right...these Canucks know how to make tea", "author": "Ed U."}

This is a pretty small storefront and I honestly didn't know what to expect since before my visit my DAVIDsTEA purchases have always been online or through a friend going to their home storefront. \n\nFirst off, I really have to give props to the employees here! My sister and I came packed with a bunch of questions and inquiries to smell the different teas and they never made us feel like we were wasting their time or we were annoying them by how excited we were about tea! They also offered us the available samples of tea (hot/cold) located in the front of the store.\n\nSecondly, the store was clean and organized. You could easily find what you need, but don't fret if it's hard to locate what you want the staff is there to help you and to also answer any questions.\n\nThird, DEALS! They have a sale section and you never know what you'll find here. Sometimes it's mugs! Sometimes it's iced tea presses. You just never know, so it's always worth stopping by just to check-in. Also in addition to their teaware also having deals as the seasons change so do the teas and the stocks of what they keep (for some, but not all teas) and sometimes teas go on sale! Keep your eyes peeled or just ask!\n\nOverall, I dig tea and I dig this spot. Definitely will return for more! \n\nRecommendations?\n- Iced Tea Press was a game changer for me. You basically brew loose leaf tea on the bottom, add ice to the inner cup, layer? Idk what it's called and press once it's done brewing and BAM yummy tea! \n- Goji Green - delicious. Just yum.\n- MATCHAAAA is yummy. They also have fruity flavors like Honeydew matcha! \n- If you're not sure you're going to love a tea, but it smells good and you like the ingredients opt for 2oz over anything larger.", "author": "Janelle V."}

Discovered it staying at a house rental in British Columbia a few years ago, and didn't realize this great Canadian import is now readily available stateside.  Cut forward a few years and there are several Nor Cal outlets, including this one in the lower level of the Westfield SF Center, adjacent to the food court.\n\nHere you can buy loose leaf teas, tea in bags, and some very well constructed infusers, brewing tools and tea holders.  Even if you are lukewarm on tea in general, you'll find something to like here and it's fun to explore their flavors.  The fruit infusion teas here are better iced than just about anything you'll find elsewhere.\n\nIts a hassle for some to get here, unless you are coming via public transport.

I just drink chinese chrysanthemum bo nay all the time, but I had just ran out, so I decided to try David's tea.\n\nWe got the Sachet tea chest: whole leaf tea in sachet format ($40) which came with 8 different teas: Buddha's blend, Organic silk dragon jasmine, Organic the skinny, Organic cream of earl grey, Coffee pu'erh, The buzz, Organic cinnamon rooibos, Forever nuts.\n\nI've tried most of the flavors from the box. I'm a very simple tea drinker. I tend to like my teas strong and I don't add any sugar, cream or milk. Call me a tea purist, but I liked the more simple teas from the box: Buddha's blend, Organic the skinny, The buzz. I could taste the subtle notes of each tea which I started appreciating. Gave me a whole new view of drinking tea.\n\nAs a coffee and tea purist, I couldn't really drink the Organic cream of earl grey or Coffee pu'erh. The cream of earl grey had an overwhelming smell and taste of vanilla. For a girl that doesn't add anything to her tea, it was a big turn off. And the coffee pu'erh seemed like a watered down coffee. I like my coffee dark and strong, so I didn't care for that at all.\n\nFor anyone who loves different types of tea, a box from David's Tea would make for a great gift.

I'll admit that I definitely liked the vibe and openness that the store exuded compared to Teavana's stores. (To be honest, the only reason I stop by Teavana is to try their samples.)\n\nEver since learning about DavidsTea, I've become more of a tea addict, and have my periodic binges of tea buying. I just wish they had a store in SoCal (hopefully soon??)  as I live in San Diego, so it saddens me when I hear about in-store deals and I'm unable to get them. \n\nThe staff was very friendly, and thank goodness for my friend Maria for being there to let me know how I could get more out of my purchases with all the deals I could combine!", "author": "Wilma M."}

He knows I love tea and like a good boyfriend he had to bring me here. We checked it out a few months back, and the employees were very friendly, helpful, and knowledgable. \n\nBefore Davids Tea I had never done loose leaf teas because it can be such a mess and hassle. But the girl showed us their products and cups that make it so simple and easy even on the go! She gave us some good recommendations and a sample of their Birthday  Cake tea which was really good.\n\nIt's a small investment to get started. Travel mugs are $25-$35. And 4 oz of tea is under $20 and makes about 15 cups of tea. We just returned last week to each get a travel mug and 4 oz of tea. I went with a fall favorite Pumpkin Chai and he got Chocolate Rocket which is a mate with chocolate, almond, and raspberry flavors. \n\nTheir teas are so fragrant and when you steep them their flavors remain. The Chocolate Rocket definitely brews a bolder flavored tea than the Pumpkin Chai which is a bit milder but they both taste amazing hot or iced! They have hundreds to choose from to satisfy all tastes and caffeine levels. Some of their teas are even organic.\n\nI love my 16 oz mug! The infuser twists on to a filtered opening for sipping, and has a twist on lid with a handle and a hidden compartment to hold tea leaves for a second cup on the go! Simple assembly, simple to clean. I was concerned that it didn't have a \"sippy\" style lid, but it gives a clear view of the tea in the cup, allows steam out without getting burnt, and has a nice lip to allow you to cool your tea before a sip. The stainless steel keeps the tea nice and warm too! Even if I leave the lid off for a few minutes taking sips here and there it's still warm. The insulated outer cup never ever gets warm. With the lid on it stays warm for hours in case I want to save some for later.\n\nMy aunt was over on Friday and was super impressed. Turns out my cousin loves tea too and my aunt said she paid double Davids Tea prices for 4 oz of tea at Teavana for him. I showed her the Davids Tea website and it is great. Shows pictures and descriptions of their teas for ordering online! They offer lots of promotions and have a rewards program. We got a free Apple Crisp candle ($20 value) for spending over $100 and while I normally wouldn't even consider paying $20 for a candle, this is the best candle I've ever had. It is fragrant just like their teas and covers smells from smoking, food, and dirty laundry.", "author": "Lisa D."}

I've been coming here for 2 years now, even after I have left my job at the mall. Every time I come here I'm excited to try new teas and spark up great conversations with the employees who work at David'sTea. The tea may be a little on the pricey side at times, however I promise you it is of the best grade. Seeing all the tea on the tea walls and being able to smell and learn what is in every single tea, just makes one feel reassured about their purchase. \n\nI'm normally the type of person who likes to do most of their shopping online, however when it comes to this little tea shop I'm always entertained by all the wonderful employees. You can ask them about any tea on their tea wall, and they can suggest any tea based on your taste. They're all very kind, and don't pressure anyone to buy their tea.

They are all displayed in tins with a color-coded name tag, and they let you smell it upon request. So far, I've experienced very nice female staff employees here who were very helpful in deciding what kind of drink I wanted. The first time I came here, I got their hot chocolate rocket mate tea with soymilk and sweetened with agave. Needless to say, on a cold day in SF it was the perfect beverage to get! They don't make it overly sweet (unless upon request) and it is just all kinds of perfect. Today when I went, I tried their creme brulee rooibos tea with soymilk, this time iced. SO yummy. Another excellent experience from the staff. Their brewed tea of the day is $3, other hot and iced beverages are $3.50, and their newly-marketed sparkling teapops are $4.50. \n\nI love their merchandise here as well!

The bright, clean, and perfectly lined tins on the wall lured me over. I probably should have just turned and ran at that point, since the store was echoing \"$$$$$$$$$$$\" in my ears. But who can resist beautifully displayed color-coded teas. \n\nAfter standing there for 5 minutes, admiring the insane selection of teas (most aren't for the purists and have infused flavors) and dreaming about what \"red velvet cake\" or \"creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e\" might taste like, the one associate in the store approached me with a sample of the Pumpkin Chai. Apparently it's in high demand, and maybe it goes better with milk, but YUCK. \n\nI was eager to find some fruit-infused flavors, since that's my jam. Had a debate with the associate over what is considered \"tart\" or \"citrus-y\" but nonetheless, he was very helpful and let me smell all the tea leaves I desired. At the cheapest, the tea leaves could come in small reflective baggies and would cost around $9-12. I decided to try a tea to help me make my decision. I ordered the mango madness and my friend ordered the spiced apple cider. We ended up liking each other's, so we switched. \n\nJust as a preface: I'm a big tea drinker. I usually like to go plain and get green tea or green tea with brown rice (YUM!) from Asian places. I also just returned from living abroad in Asia for 2 years so i mainly came here to try something quirky. \n\nThoughts on the teas:\n\n1. Mango Madness-This honestly tasted like nothing to me. The associate sweetened it with agave but it really did not taste like much. I was bored within a sip.\n\n2. Spiced Apple Cider (seasonal)-My friend did not like this and after pondering on it, I realize that it smells quite like apple vinegar. However, I don't like apple vinegar and I liked this tea. Had lots of flavor.\n\n3. Citrus blahblahblah-Don't remember the whole name, although I bought a bag. It has the taste but I would squeeze another lemon in for extra flavor. It's fine. Not impressed.\n\nSummary: I bought two small bags, the Spiced Apple Cider and the Citrus tea. Came to a total of about $20. Pretty expensive considering I don't know about the quality of the leaves. I've drank two cups at home so far and I'm decently satisfied. The five stars are mainly dedicated to the nice associate and the beautiful layout of the store.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

Lately I've found new love with \"Chai Guarana\" and \"Cinnamon Heart\" teas. The price of $3.50 per cup of tea is steep (even if they add complimentary milk/soy or sweeteners to it) so I prefer purchasing the loose leaf in 2 or 4oz increments. 4oz earns you a free tin, and if you bring back the tin for refills, you get a small discount for reusing it. They also have a \"Frequent Steeper\" loyalty program where you earn a point for every dollar you spent. Each 100 points earns you a free cup of tea and 2oz of loose leaf.

There are a ton of different types of variations if what I like isn't what you like so take a peek if you're in Westfield SF.\n\nTypes of teas the carry:  white tea, green tea, oolong tea, black tea, pu'erh tea, herbal tea, mate tea, and rooibos tea. Within each of the types there are several flavors\n\nMy absolute favorite tea flavor:  Birthday Cake (caffeine free, rooibos, with a taste of birthday cake)\n\nOther favorites:  Red Velvet Cake (black tea with chocolate chips, beetroot and red sprinkles), Salted Caramel (black tea with English toffee, coconut, caramel and French sea salt). For Green tea I like: Movie Night (green tea with apple, maple and popcorn).  \n\nThe staff at this location are very friendly and overly excited to talk about the different types of teas, but that works for me because I like to smell the different types of teas they have.\n\nNOTE:  some of the descriptions are from the DAVIDsTEA tea book to give a precise description of my faves", "author": "Caroline A."}

They are all over in Toronto with David's leading the market. I was so stoked when I discovered that David's had started to open up around SF. I knew there were a couple in NYC, but it didn't even occur to me that they would have made their way out to the West Coast of the US yet. \n\nThe teas are AMAZING, the tea products are good as well. I've owned 3. One of the tea steepers that pours out the bottom when placed on a mug, and 2 mugs with metal steepers. One of them the paint started to come off after only a month of hand washing though, but I still use it 2 years later.\n\nI admit that I haven't been to any locations in SF yet as I just found out 3 days ago about them here, and none are close enough for me to pop in to, but I will go out of my way when I'm in a hood with one from now on.", "author": "Kristen M."}

I loved the look of their tea wall and all the cute little teaware items (in all the colors I like, to boot). \n\nHOWEVER...the customer service could have been way better. When I walked in, I wasn't greeted or anything, which is fine since I like to shop kind of under the radar, but when the shop is that small AND you made eye contact with one of the salesgirls, it's a little awkward. \n\nWhat really irked me was having this completely unnecessary back-and-forth conversation about their tea-to-water ratio. \nMe: It says on the label, \"1.5 teaspoons for every cup.\" What is considered a cup here?\nSalesgirl #1: Well, a cup has a lot of teaspoons in it...so that would be a lot of tea.\nMe: No, I mean, how much water do you consider a cup?\nSalesgirl #1 calls over Salesgirl #2 \nMe: *repeats question*\nSalesgirl #2: Well, it's really up to you. Tea is really personal, you know? \nMe: Okay...your directions say to put 1.5 teaspoons in one cup of water. Is David's Tea's definition of a \"cup\" 8 oz? 12 oz? 14 oz?\nSalesgirl #1 holds up their cardboard cups, and Salesgirl #2 says: \"This is what we use as a cup. I'd say that's about 5 to 6 oz.\" \nMe: *thinking there is NO WAY that cup is only 5 or 6 oz* Uhh...okay, thanks.\n\nIt BAFFLES me that these two girls had absolutely NO IDEA what I was asking. Tea-to-water ratio is pretty important, imo. Yes, \"tea is personal\" and I totally could have experimented, but since I had only purchased 2 oz of tea, why would I waste tea trying to figure that out?\n\nIf you're looking to buy tea here, I highly recommend going in already knowing what you want (and knowing your ish about tea). The salesgirls are pretty unhelpful.\n\nBased on that experience alone, I'd give the place 2 stars, but because they sold small cheap tea tins in different colors, I bumped it up a star. Their Salted Caramel and Red Velvet Cake teas also smelled really good, so I'm hoping they taste just as good.", "author": "Faye S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-11-18", "description": "So I'm a little late with this review. I was here the day before and the day after David's officially opened in the Powell St. Westfield. The day before, the store was covered with unopened boxes, the staff was busy unpacking, and David's wasn't technically opened yet. However, one staff member was kind enough to answer my questions and give me a couple of coupons: one for a free cup of tea, and one for a free all-in-one infuser tea mug with the purhase of $20 of loose-leaf tea (your 4th star David's).\n\nDavid's sells a combination of \"straight\" loose-leaf teas (i.e. teas without added natural or artificial flavoring or aromatics) and flavored teas. However, the flavored teas greatly outnumber the straight teas. For those of you just getting exposed to tea, and wanting to wean yourselves away from teabags and Starbucks, then David's is the perfect next step. For you boba and milk tea fans, David's flavored tea selection makes excellent bases for do-it-yourself home brews, which is what I did with their \"Hot Chocolate\" rooibos mint-chocolate flavored tea.  For the tea traditionalist, you can go ahead and snub David's, there are many better sources of non-flavored, unspoiled loose-leaf tea in SF.\n\nDavid's Tea is a Johnny-come-lately to California, and it has plenty of competition on its hands (Lupicia for instance). It is a Canadian-based company and until recently with its move to SF, only had a smattering of stores across the East Coast of the U.S. In addition to this store, I've been to one of the David's in Vancouver. I was more impressed with the Vancouver location. Their menu included this wonderful chilled tea called \"Northern Lights,\" which was disappointingly not available at the Powell store. But I can chalk it up to a changing tea menu.\n\nThe day after David's opened, I came back. I bought $20 of genmaicha (Japanese green tea with toasted rice) and this thing called \"Cocomint Cream\" and got my free mug, which I love. In terms of aromatics, the genmaicha has none (most of their \"straight\" teas have no aroma). The taste did make up for it though. In addition to toasted rice, David's adds popcorn pieces to it's genmaicha recipe. When brewed the tea had a pleasant toastiness that is perfect for winter weather. The \"Cocomint Cream\" is going to be chilled, milked, and bobafied.\n\nIn conclusion, David's is ok. It appeals to a broad audience. But really, this is San Francisco! There are so many better choices than David's! Tourists, if you want a great tea experience, go one block up to Samovar Tea Lounge in Yerba Buena Gardens! SF specializes in Chinese tea houses! Go to Taste, one BART station over in the Civic Center/Hayes Valley. Or take a look up north to, dare I say it, Chinatown!?", "author": "Andrew P."}

ALL OF THEM. \n\nOf course the best flavors are subjective, but all of these teas are of high quality- to add sweet to fantastic, a lot of them are Fair Trade teas.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-06-07", "description": "Eh...perhaps I've just been spoiled by Lupicia but I find that a lot of the tea from DavidsTea doesn't really live up to expectations. With Lupicia, there may be tiny bits of fruit or candy thrown in, but the overwhelming bulk of the tea is high-quality leaf that could easily stand on its own. DavidsTea...they just throw SO MUCH STUFF into the blend that it gets kind of gimmicky and you end up having to use loads of it just to get a strong tea base brewed. At this price point, that's not really cool. \n\nGranted, some are spot-on: Red Velvet Cake and Brazillionaire taste delicious. When DavidsTea is good, it is very, very good in that \"How the hell did they do THAT?\" way. But there are quite a few that don't justify the price tag.\n\nThe staff are great with the samples, but it's annoying to have to bother them to get everything single can off the shelves if you want to take a sniff. It would be better if people could just browse on their own and not have (really enthusiastic) employees hovering. Dunno, some people like the attention and suggestions when they're in a shop, but sometimes you just want to look things over by yourself and not get pressured to buy stuff, y'know? Especially when there's over 100 cans on the wall and you just want a couple minutes to see what's there in the first place.\n\nOn the plus side, they're pretty good with giving you th exact weight you want (2 oz is 2 oz, not 3.5).If I had any advice, it would be to trim the fat - don't have so many different kinds if tea, but rather just focus on making a smaller number of them a better quality. And don't make staff push sales *quite* so hard...it's kind of off-putting.", "author": "Julia K."}

I appreciate this gesture and this updated review reflects it.  Just because of the actions of one of their employees does not reflect the rest of the company.  I just want my review to be fair.", "author": "Goshen F."}

You can buy tea by the .5 oz instead of having to buy an entire tin which is awesome. the lady that was workin that day was also really helpful and patient with questions. I think they also have a bigger variety than teavana", "author": "Tao Tao W."}

The employees are amazingly helpful..plus they don't give you that fake, overbearingly friendly welcome that Teavana does. They're genuine, sweet, and know what they're talking about. One of the girls with really short hair asked me what my name was and the next time I came in, she remembered my name, and greeted me immediately, asking me how my day was going. They're just seriously SO nice! I feel very comfortable, and you can tell that they care more about the customers happiness over making sales. I highly suggest going here. It's the least expensive tea in the city, but unmistakably good quality as well. Want a good tea experience? Go to one of their locations :D", "author": "Eve F."}

There are beginning to be too many of these shops to choose from but maybe that will keep prices in check a bit?", "author": "Shannon L."}

The employee that helped me was nice, but in training, so she wasn't quite up to speed and labeled one of my black teas with a rooibos sticker, but I'll let that go because she was new. I bought organic stormy night, the brazillionaire, and organic coffee chai. I love them all! Stormy night is delicious with chocolate and cinnamon, the brazillionaire is nutty, and the chai spices were nicely complimented with the coffee...kinda chocolately actually. All three are like dessert in a cup with milk and sugar. I'll definitely be back!", "author": "Elizabeth S."}

When i told her i sold handbags, she threw her hands up in the air and went, \"WOOO HOO!!!\" i do not have an exciting job or work for an exciting company. this lady was insane and it was fairly jarring.", "author": "Alex C."}
