It's located near the 2nd and Stevenson Muni stop and Flower Power dispensary. My colleagues have eaten here before and had good things to say, so I tried it. My experience was not as positive as theirs. So, when I entered the establishment, I was a bit confused about the prices because on the window there is a menu with all whited out prices. When I got it in, its like most Mexican food establishments where you place your order, they prepare it in front of you and you pay at the end. I ordered a Regular Shrimp Burrito on a spinach wrap and I must say, \"I was not impressed.\" For $11.92 I expect that my burrito to be wrapped tightly. When I unwrapped it from the foil, it basically unrolled and as most people know, it's almost impossible to re-roll \"correctly!\" The shrimp was not seasoned and I had to remind the woman at the counter to give me tortilla chips like she did everyone else. Overall the burrito was edible, but, I'm disappointed I spent roughly $12 on something that wasn't t better than chipotle. I hope you have a better experience than I did.", "author": "Rhett B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-01-18", "description": "I randomly picked Caramba for lunch a couple of days ago as I was in the mood for Mexican food and wanted something close by my place of work. At the peak lunch hour the place was packed and there was a big line, both of which is expected in FiDi so I joined the end.\n\nIn most places the line moves fast, but not the case here. The place felt very loud mostly because the people behind the counter were shouting things to each other. When my turn came I saw a big white sheet of paper calling my name - It had Chicken Chimichanga ($8.99) written on top so I went with that. It was a little bit of a challenge to let the server know that would like the sour cream and guacamole but I'm used to that by now. Again after ordering it was a pretty long wait or at-least it felt like a pretty long wait to get my order to-go. I timed it - from the time I entered to the time I left it was 25 minutes of standing in line and then waiting for the order, which was a whole 10 minutes above my acceptable threshold for lunch at FiDi.\n\nLet's come to the food. I got a decent sized container with a lot of food. The Chimichanga was big enough that even a hearty eater like me would have some left-overs. Here's the catch it was a soggy, rubbery, chewy piece of crap. Obviously this was not made to order but was fried probably early morning and then had been sitting out so that it could be dished out to idiots like me. I should stop doing this to myself i.e. ordering fried food from essentially what are seam table operations. I have to report that the chicken in the Chimichanga was not dry and if I'd got it in a wet burrito I would have probably praised it. Even the rice was not the typical over steamed Mexican rice that you get at Taqueria's. So after discarding the outer soggy tortilla the rest of the contents were very eatable.\n\nPrice wise it was cheap for FiDi. Overall looking at the time it took for the order, the quality of what I got and the distance from my place of work, I'm not really inclined to return here in a hurry. The only Mexican place worth going to in FiDi in my opinion is Tropisue\u00f1o but that is for another review.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

I fully understand the effect that numerous bad reviews can have on a business and I only hope the owners/management can improve their establishment, over time, with constructive criticism.\n\nThe employees I encountered where all very friendly and quick to serve. \n\nMusic matters. I know it's not free but neither is electricity, it's a must. Turn on the radio. Even the detritus known as KOIT is better than dead silence.\n\nThe menu is easy to read and makes ordering very quick and painless. Thank you.\n\nThe Steak quesadilla was my choice for the day and because I was living large I upped the ante and indulged in a side (small portion cup) of, \"sour cream.\" This stuff was so cut it didn't even taste sour and had the consistency of La Victoria Green Mild Salsa. What a nightmare. If I was to guess, it tasted like it was mixed with heavy cream. I didn't even care to ask the price when she asked to add it on so had I been charged a $1 I'd have been none the wiser. Maybe I was. For two table spoons, at the most, for a buck you'd turn a darn good profit for the best sour cream San Francisco has to offer but instead I was given something even Taco Bell couldn't get away with. I must assume they sell it to you at the counter as there isn't enough to put into your quesadilla and still taste it.\n\nTalking about taste one thing that must be present is oil and fat. Let's be honest here friends, we all very well understand that a quesadilla must drip a little. There's got to be juice. No juice. No flavor. When I was given my tiny portion cup of, \"sour cream\" I was also given two small napkins. I thought to my self, \"that isn't going to cut it!\" But you know what? I didn't even touch my second napkin because this poor excuse for a meal didn't drip once. Check out my plate. Pathetic.\n\nPersonal rant: The sign posted behind the counter, facing the customers, stating, \"No cell phones for employees,\" yells out to me that management is disengaged from their staff. I get that people shouldn't be on their phones while getting paid. In fact, I fully support it but put it somewhere else so customers don't have to look at it. I wouldn't take points off for this but it makes me not want to stick around. It doesn't sound like a fun place to work.

The sauces on the right that are offered seemed a tad slim, mild green sauce for your chips, salsa was emptied out, and the red sauce was also fairly low, it seemed the spicier dark red sauce was the only thing that had plenty to go around mind you it was 11:45am so the lines have not started yet. \n\nThe ordering process it seems they have organized and down pat, walk in, look up order move to the right to pay, get some sauces if there are any available for your chips, no need looking for spoons they only offer forks and knives\n\nI sampled there super burrito with carne asada (steak diced) and al pastor (seasoned pork), the burrito included, latin reddish hued rice, refried beans if not black beans are offered by request, shredded cheese also offered, salsa, sourcream, gauc, mild or hot sauce offered by request and wrapped in a flour tortilla from what I could taste. Portion wise it was decent size enough to get you full but not enough to put you in a coma, the carne asada was slightly salted the al pastor was better seasoned from what I could taste, the mixture of rice, refried beans, sour cream and gauc made it difficult for you to decipher what you were biting down on, but as far as I could tell it was a decent burrito, the was juicy, the sauces found its way out through small ruptures in the tortilla  where you would bite down some sections had no where of moving so ruptures do occur bleeding out all the sauce, get napkins you will need them, unless you like licking your fingers then don't bother. It was not the best burrito I have every had but it was better then average, portion wise good, taste wise on the meats seems they need a tad more flavoring but when meshed all together in the burrito, everything meshed just right.\n\nThere are other options they offer like nacho fries, or fries buried in everything you put on nachos, I passed on some of these options, I did not want to be in a coma headed back to work, it is good to know they are offered though\n\nWash everything down with a cup of their horcata (made from ground almonds, sesame seeds, rice, barley or tigernuts) honestly it I thought it was just made from ground rice, milk and sugar hahha always refreshing if you don't get the bottom of the tub, here is precupped and ready to be distributed.\n\nIf you are in the area, this place is decent, not to get you in a coma but enough to make you snore maybe just a little then 1 hour after consuming, be glad to come back and try more of their meat options\n\nburrito *** decent portion, decent flavor on their super burritos if the meat falls out and was not hit by the gauc, or sourcream it is still tender, not super juicy and lightly salted (carne asada) the al pastor was well seasoned\nprice $ burrito and horcata just over the $10 mark\nservice **** quick friendly staff\nambiance *** looks older inside, tight fit, small tables, shared by all patrons can sit up to 6 people per table", "author": "Clarence A."}

Each time he's gone, he's gotten the same thing. He's very simple, kind of picky, but  reasonable eater. \n\nLast Friday 11/13, he ordered the same burrito he orders each week, but this time with extra hot sauce. He made it back to work and around an hour after lunch he started feeling ill. He threw up at work twice and was on the toilet back to back. He made it home and told me he didn't feel good. I advised him to relax, drink some water and eat something small and bland. \n\nBy 8:30 pm that night, he was non-stop throwing up and was rushed to the ER. Upon arrival at the ER, he fainted. He was in the restroom throwing up in the ER and he passed out and had to be carried into the bed by nurses. He was immediately IV'd and his body took up 5 bags of fluid which he had lost throughout the day. He was shivering, body was sore, he felt nausea constantly. He was in the ER for 4 hours. They diagnosed him with Food Poisoning and sent him home with nausea and diarrhea pills. \n\nHe was certain there was something wrong with his burrito, he said it just didn't taste the same like it usually does. He was very concerned and doesn't want anyone else to get sick due to lack of attention from cross-contamination. Something had to have been mixed up and for it to hit him 1 hour after eating, it was definitely cross-contamination here which caused severe food poisoning. \n\nBe mindful, and happy trails!", "author": "Alyssa M."}

So I proceeded to just order my ideal breakfast burrito and ignored the menu altogether.\n\nService was fairly slow.

Caramba!... this must be the place for you 'cause I ain't that impressed, gringo. I was wondering why nobody around any of the offices I worked at in the area ever talked about this place. Ever. After all, there aren't that many Mexican places in this part of the FiDi where you can grab and go unless you count the 360 Degrees Burritos in the Galleria. But come on, you can't count that, can you? Granted, I have to give credit to the owners of Caramba for trying to open a Mission-style taqueria on Second, but unfortunately, I just wasn't too impressed with what I had.\n\nI thought I should take advantage of the $5.99 Chicken Salad which was admittedly a good price for the portion. The bed of spinach was a nice choice, but then there was the chicken - charred, dried out and hardly edible. It must have been sitting in the warming tray for quite some time to achieve that kind of rubbery texture. The tomato salsa and chip strips did nothing to hide the petty poultry problem (see photo). But hey, of course, I sat there and ate the chips. The people at the other tables didn't seem to have a problem gorging on their burritos and chimichangas, but then again, they looked like they slept in their tattered Macworld T-shirts.\n\nFOOD - 2 stars...dried-out chicken is just not cool...the Instagram photo makes it look far more appetizing than it was\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...crowded at lunch and tables don't get bussed too quickly\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...they look tired\nTOTAL - 2 stars...need to satisfy my Mexican cravings elsewhere", "author": "Ed U."}

Some of them were middle of the road and it took reviewing them to truly understand how I felt about them. Rare is the business that's so... blah that it fails to make an impression during the experience or once I've consulted my notes to jar my memory. Rare.\n\nLadies & gents, Caramba is just such a business.\n\nEven after reading my notes (taken during my time there), I was hard-pressed to remember the experience. It was only after looking at pictures and reading the corresponding notes (what? Don't look at me like that. Getting these reviews right is part of my job. I take it seriously) that it started coming back to me. But, even then, I wasn't all that inspired to write about my experience. So, that should say something right then and there.\n\nWhat Caramba has going for it is location, speed and ease of service. In a city like SF with tremendous dining experiences to be had at any price point, if you are offering 'okay' fare, you'd best be bringing something else to the table. In Caramba's case, it's location makes it very convenient to the legions of hungry, stressed and gotta-go types who work in this part of town (spoiler alert: there are lots of them). Knowing the market, the folks at Caramba make sure to get you in and out in a relatively short amount of time. Lastly, there isn't any Elaine-Benes-at-the-soup-nazi-ish hemming and hawing of the menu. It's easy. It's digestible. It's meant to help you make a fast choice, order and be on your way. That said, it's a system that can get jammed up and when my group of seasoned eaters/orderers came in that's exactly what happened. My notes read, 'amazingly, ordering turned into a hot mess.' The trouble came when the woman behind the counter got a bit flustered with our en masse group. That surprises me because I'd imagine that lunch rushes are the usual around here.\n\nAs I typically do, I went rogue. I ordered the super nachos with chicken. They were (verbatim from my notes) 'passable.' The chips started off wet and flimsy (what you expect at the end of the nacho gorging). There was little seasoning to be tasted and the ingredients were all of on their own islands. That said, the nachos were piled high and were good for the money. At Caramba, you'll get an okay experience but that's not a surprise (or, worry) for you. You're here to get some food in your belly with relatively little fuss.", "author": "Johnny T."}

Good heat in the hot sauce, the chorizo was savory and oily, mixed with eggs and small bits of potatoe, it was a delight. The service could be nicer and they could clean the place up a bit, but whatever. \n\nI was so tempted to rip it out of the tin foil and go to town on it on my walk back to the office, but I delayed that, and it was great.

Most of the food I've sampled here have been mediocre, leaving me saying \"caramba\" far more often than \"sabrosa!\"\n\nService hasn't been real hot during my last few visits, sometimes the lines get a little out of hand and it becomes a mini human conveyor belt of order food-pay-load up on condiments deal. There haven't been too many smiles from behind the counter, though I imagine I'd be the same way if I were serving this food.\n\nWhile I've had pretty decent results with their breakfast burrito, all else has become leftovers / scraps on the plate otherwise. I've had soggy tacos dorados on more than one occasion, a few bland and wet burritos (which are not euphemisms for anything other than messy food), and a super sad string of salads (being healthy never tasted so meh).\n\nThe prices aren't too terrible, it can get way spendier in this part of SOMA.

A perfectly-sized breakfast for a very reasonable price. \n\nMy favorite is the caramba burrito - with chorizo and spicy. You can also add potatoes, if you're into that.

This is THE best Mexican restaurant in the FiDi that I have found. The name is cornball and I initially had no faith this place would be good but I've fallen in love. Skip the chain restaurants and walk another block over to some better Mexican food.\n\nThe food here is fresh, authentic and beyond satisfactory every time! They make the food right in front of you so if you are picky or have food allergies make sure to watch them and be very clear. This is an authentic spot so many of the workers have thick accents and a coworker of mine with food allergies had a bad experience due to a language barrier. \n\nMany of my Yelp peeps know how much I love their chile verde burrito (CVB). It is like no other from anywhere I have ever had. And for the record the sauce is actually green (I know that sounds like a no brainer but trust me, it's not always green at other places). My coworker loves and orders the chicken mole burrito. Personally, I have not tried it but he swears it's bomb. \n\nThey serve breakfast and lunch but I'm not sure about dinner. They now use Order Ahead to take individual on-line orders (ALWAYS a fan of that service). I just recently tried their breakfast burritos and they are to DIE for! However, they are pretty small and it will leave you craving more (sad face). They also have a healthy variety in their salsa bar: a couple hot, a couple mild and a green salsa. I believe they have chopped, pickled carrots and jalapenos too. \n\nThe cons about this place besides a potential language barrier is sometimes they don't honor their check-in deals such as Yelp app (ahem) or other programs unless you have a physical paper print out (how you print out a mobile check-in offer is beyond me). Perhaps they lack internal communication of how to accept such deals but don't count on that free agua fresca or soda with check-in.\n\nBesides the cons, the food speaks for itself. Also, you might want to add a nice cold brew with your lunch. They have a pretty good selection of Mexican beer such as Modelo, Pacifico, and Dos Equis.", "author": "Chanelle N."}

While the meat (Chicken Mole) was tender and rather tasty, the guacamole distribution dead on and the warmth of the burrito consistent throughout, there was little cheese in evidence and the spiciness of the burrito (I prefer my burrito's to be palate-scorchingly spicy) was...underwhelming. In fact, spice was definitely absent, as was any flavor characteristic of a Mole sauce.\n\nThe hot sauces offered were a nice touch (the chipoltle salsa helped to kick the meal's spiciness up) and I enjoyed the pickled vegetable mixture, they were not enough to save this meal from the depths of mediocrity that it was consigned to because of the poorly constructed burrito.\n\nHowever, the horchata was outstanding (top 5 in my life without a doubt) and being able to sit outside on a warm San Francisco afternoon and gnaw on a slab was a rare delight.\n\nIf they work on the construction of their burritos and their spice, I'd be more then willing to add a third (and possibly fourth) star.", "author": "Casey U."}

Then I finished my meal and can confirm that this place is perfect for Caucasian people.  Please don't take offense to that, all I'm trying to say is Caramba exemplifies the following:\n\n-Very high level of cleanliness\n-Easy to read, big boards\n-Staff that is 100% fluent in English\n-Detailed descriptions for type of meat, type of dish (enchiladas, tortas, etc.)\n\n^^^ I've noticed a trend of yelp reviewers who use these categories as the main basis for their reviews of Mexican food.  These are of minimal importance to me, when did people start to hate hole-in-the-walls so much?\n\nThe quality of food and selection is decent, but I give it 3 stars because honestly, it's just not my style of Mexican cuisine.  95% of the people here during lunch ordered the most generic thing ever : Carne Asada Super Burrito.  Even more surprising with offerings like Barbacoa on the menu....\n\nI ordered the Chicken Mole super burrito with no rice, just as I do at every other Mexican place I go to in SF.  I'm guessing the guy wasn't used to this request (but handled other requests perfectly like sub rice for lettuce, no sour cream but extra sauce, etc.) because the moment I started to eat my burrito, everything fell out right away.  They re-made it immediately, and the 2nd time around it was wrapped properly. \n\nThe ingredients were undeniably fresh, but the burrito was very bland, even though I asked for him to make it spicy.  Unfortunately, I've become accustomed to this.  So many people with weak tolerances for spice will ask that their burrito be made \"very spicy\".  After enough customers in this category visit a place (happens very quickly), this understandably causes restaurants to not fulfill that request (make it spicy) to the fullest extent (throw some salty jalapenos on it instead).  So when a person who actually wants a spicy burrito (me!) asks for something to be made spicy, they are left very unsatisfied.  It's kind of like that scene in Parks and Recreation when Ron Swanson asks the diner for all the bacon and eggs they have, and he has to say it again to them to make sure they truly got the message and meaning of his statement.\n\nMy normal workaround for this is to ask for habaneros, but of course, due to the crowd this place caters to (reiterating that there is nothing wrong with that, they are simply adapting for the best interests of their business), they did not have any.\n\nSo to sum up, if you're the kind of person who gave El Faro a horrible yelp review because it wasn't clean enough for you, the burrito didn't have enough sour cream, or you're mad that chips weren't free, Caramba is perfect for you!", "author": "Aalok P."}

While the names have changed, I think it's still the same owners...   Well, at least I recognized the cashier at Caramba.\n\nI got the 3 taquitos especial to go, which basically means that some dude heads out back and throws a couple of frozen taquitos into the deep-fryer...  Some couple of minutes later, he comes back and they ask you what kind of beans you want...  I highly recommend the refried beans, a great choice for plenty of afternoon flatulence.   Of course, it being the especial, they'll ask you if you want guacomole and sour cream.   \"Yes, plenty of both,\" should be your reply.   Might I suggest that you also ask for spicy salsa spread over the whole thing?   So they hand me this to-go box, I pay my $8  (includes a soda), and I head back to my office to eat in front of my computer.   \n\nWhat'd I think?\n\nBaaahhh...  While it was certainly not bad, it wasn't good either... I think Rico Mex is at least as good as this place, and they're closer to my work.   Don't expect to see me at Caramba much... That said, it's solid Mexican food... assuming of course you're never spent a long amount of time in Southern California or, better yet, Mexico... in which case you'll think this food sucks donkey balls.

Unfortunately Caramba missed on most of them. When I entered the restaurant it seemed to fit the bill. Nothing flashy, a purposeful and thus authentic looking Mexican food shack. Then I saw the price of the Bacon and egg, $2.85. \"Wow, thats cheap I thought\". I should have known. When I received my burrito it was pitifully sized. Real burritos would have looked at this one, and told it to come back when it grows up. A good rule of thumb for a place like this. Your burrito should at least be bigger than what you would get at a taco bell. If you haven't figured it out yet, this thing was ridiculously small.  My phone was bigger. Think about that. 2nd ding was the tortilla. For a place to win on this, they have to use an authentic tortilla. This burrito was wrapped in something bought at the local supermarket and chocked full of preservatives. The salsa inside was tasty, Ill give them that (though not at all spicy, as advertised). \n\nI don't know, perhaps breakfast is not their strong suit. Maybe I should give them a try at lunch.

Ahead of me was a couple, (who please God noooooo, don't let them actually be together or having f'ugly people sex as that visual may scar me for life), who couldn't decide what to order.\n\nI wasn't on a super tight time constraint or anything, but c'mon, it's Mexican food, it's the same 7 ingredients served multiple ways, so pick a presentation and let's motor already. After about 4 minutes (no, I'm not exaggerating), they settled on burritos. Hallelujah! But now they needed to talk the little lady behind the counter through it. Here we go.\n\nAs soon as she grabbed the flour tortilla, this broad was 8 steps ahead of her and asking for cheese. And not in the, \"Hey, I will be wanting cheese at some point, cuz boy howdy do I love me some cheese\" way, but in a super frazzled, amazingly panicked, the world is about to run out of cheese in the next 10 seconds!?!? tone. Jeez lady, calm down. \n\nAs she went down the line, she reminded the gal that she needed extra cheese. Yes, we got it lady, the whole restaurant is with ya, you will get your cheese. As soon as the thing was bursting at its cheesy seams (the burrito, not the broad, although she didn't look like much of a stranger to the effects of cheese, if ya know what's sayin') it was time for her to choose a beverage. Oh Lord, here we go!\n\nBroad: \"Do I like the Negro Modelo?\"\nAnnoyed Male Friend: \"I don't know, do you?\"\nBroad: \"Well I don't remember? Will it go with my burrito? Is it a Mexican?\"\nOver it Male Friend: \"I don't know, probably\"\nBroad: Well should I get the...what is this, the horchaaataaaa drink?\"\nMy New Hero Male Friend: \"Who cares, just pick something!?\"\n\nMan, I love people.

Yes, the chorizo is awesome and savory.  Yes, the tortilla was just as soft and it held everything together just right.  But!  This time... I got more than just chorizo wrapped in tortilla.

Generally I like to be busting out of my pants after eating a big lunch, but the portions should be sufficient for those of you with sound judgement.\n\nWhat can I say? I recommend asking them to put a bit of mild salsa, and a bit of the hot.  Mild is too weak, and the hot is pretty effing hot, so the mix is perfect.  A regular burrito will run you just under $6 after tax which is a bargain almost on any metric.\n\nA regular burrito comes with the industry standard meat, beans, rice, salsa.

Unfortunately the Chinese place didn't seem all that appealing once we took a look at the steam table selections and we walked out without having a real clear idea of what we really wanted to eat.  Short on time, we saw Caramba and decided to get Mexican for lunch.\n\nCaramba does have some interesting menu choices (fries in your burrito?) but we decided to go with the steak torta and an order of with al pastor.  Both items were okay- nothing particularly wrong with them but nothing spectacular either.  The steak torta came with a decent amount of grilled steak pieces (got a hint of some smokiness), as well as a liberal amount of refried beans, some pickled jalapeno slices, large slices of lettuce, some onion, and a small smudge of guacamole on a Dutch crunch roll.  Not sure that the Dutch crunch went all that great with the ingredients but at least the bread didn't get too soggy from the beans.  As for the nachos, we were disappointed that they placed the nachos in the microwave in order to melt the cheese.  The al pastor was just okay- the meat was chopped up in pretty small pieces so I wasn't really able to get a decent taste.  Their guacamole and sour cream were a little on the runny side, but other than that, its hard to mess up with nachos.\n\n3 stars- not the best Mexican I've had by a long shot but it was decent.  I just wish they kept an eye on their salsa bar and the water containers- we were there not long after the lunch rush and the water was pretty much gone while I snagged one of the last two salsa containers.", "author": "Angela H."}

The employees seemed to have a little trouble directing the flow of traffic and this before a huge line of people came in. (Perhaps that's what caused the backup.)\n\nI ordered a Super burrito (which comes with guac and sour cream, but I requested no guac). The cashier called out for a Regular Burrito. I started up, remembered what I ordered, and waited.\n\nThe woman who made my burrito told the cashier it was for me, who then motioned it to me in the \"oh, this is your order after all\" sort of motion. I said I wanted a Super Burrito. Cue discussion. Burrito maker said I got a Regular one due to no guacamole. I glanced up at the sign and it says on their menu that a Super comes with BOTH sour cream and guacamole.\n\nI said this to her and she said, \"It's fine.\" Not that she put it in there, but the words, \"it's fine.\" The gentleman who was involved with the traffic direction issue said to me, \"That makes you feel really confident, doesn't it?\" I agreed.\n\nSo I paid and got chips. I went back to work to find my suspicions were confirmed. No sour cream. I'm also docking a star for their super bland salsa. What happened? It used to be spicy! I even tried scooping up the salsa juice, but it was like eating chips with tomato pieces. \n\nIt's a real pity, because I'm picky about my burritos and this place has chips consistently. And to be fair I was NOT charged for a Super Burrito. But I only said I didn't want guacamole, not sour cream. Clearly the burrito maker didn't want to admit her mistake.", "author": "AccioSoyMilk .."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-04-06", "description": "As a selective trend follower I selected to follow the trend of Thursdays being the new Fridays last night 1 because I'm super chic and 2 because I really wanted to get hammered and I'll take any excuse (from not wanting the booze to go bad to my crippling loneliness). So Friday morning I joined the ranks of the super hung over co-workers and in between the naps I was trying to sneak in and the intermittent paper shuffling sounds I would make to sound like I was working I realized two things: sacrifices must be made to be super trendy (such as work productivity and the contents of your stomach), and I really needed something greasy. \n\nSo for lunch me and a co-worker decided to get Mexican for lunch, and we stumbled upon this place in our search for anything with a cartoon sombrero on it. We chose this place because of the fancy d\u00e9cor in the style of: Every Other Mexican Food Joint EVER, and that they had a salsa bar of lies and deceit (will explain later)....no, I'm going to explain it now..... no, later. So I decided to get the chicken chimichanga and when I got my order the chimichanga turned out to be dream crushingly small (because most of my dreams involve a comically huge chimichanga). They did provide filler beans and rice and the whole plate turned out to be surprisingly filling, but what they didn't provide were the chips. I assumed from the open salsa bar that they would have chips available (hence my cordial nick name of the salsa bar) but instead it was offered in a zip-lock bag for a dollar, ONE WHOLE DOLLAR!! That's like twenty nickels! You know how many bags of candy I could buy with twenty nickels, and a time machine? Like twenty! \n\nThe cashier was pretty friendly and upbeat and they do have free Horchata which made it better and overall the food was pretty good. The chimichanga had the right degree of crispiness and some of the salsa was surprisingly spicy. Despite the small size and what looked to be a precooked chimichanga, the meal was surprisingly satisfying and afterwards my desire to leave a flaming bag of dog poo in front of their door after I ring the bell and run away has gone down from a must do to a slight yearning. \n\nSo over all this place offers a good meal with many different choices besides burritos (they have the option of adding fries INTO any burrito or dish they have). The downside is that the chips aren't free, but hey, you do get a free zip-lock bag with the chips you buy, and that zip-lock bag really decorated my trash and added much needed differentiation.", "author": "Youchen W."}

I am almost greatful, this place doesn't get much business- it's lunch only, they close at 4pm. A  few $'s cheaper than Chipotle with more authentic cuisine and alot more options. This place is awesome. I've been here twice and had the chicken quesidilla- the best mexicn BBQ chicken i have ever had. I have never had chicken so tender in my life. Amazing flavor and authentic. All the workers are mexican and eat the actual food on breaks which is a good sign- a mexican friend of mine said that this place reminded her of the mexican family restaurants back home. It's the type of place you can come in and dine alone without feeling like a total loner like i did for an early dinner lol. Decent sized place. Doesn't matter if you wait in a line or not they take your order upfront depending on who got there first. They yell the orders out when they come and you pay to the right of where you ordered. Food is fast and good, they charge extra for sourcream or guacamole but when she asked if i wanted sourcream she did not charge me. Nice ladies nice environment including some even more secluded corner tables if you want more privacy. Never really crowded- they just close super early. If people go to Chipoltle over this place they either don't know the area, or this place is sadly closed. It's next to a bar that opens late at night and god they would get such business if they were open later! This is the place and the food is always great with large portions and is very cheap.
