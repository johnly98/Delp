Everything here is quite expensive, but hey, it's a prime location in SF, so can't really complain. For food, I had the kimchee fried rice with chicken and dukbokki with ramen. Both were quite good. The dukbokki was VERY spicy though, so if you can't handle spice well, maybe try asking them if they can make it less spicy. Portions were quite small for the price. \n\nIn terms of drinks, we ordered plain soju and beer to make somaek and had lots of fun making the soju bombs and taking pics and videos of those haha. The drink was also quite yummy. We also got the mango soju cocktail and enjoyed that. Again, quite pricy, but enjoyable and tasty.", "author": "Erica T."}

I went at 8:45pm on a Friday night and probably waited about 15-20 min. When you come in, there is a clipboard where you can write your name down. Make sure to find this clipboard because no one will greet you to mark you down.\n\n2. The internal design is hip and cool. They have neon lights and a projector that plays k-pop videos.\n\n3. The food is okay. As a Korean, I can say the food here is below average compared to Korean food in Korea but average-to-above average in USA. I got Pollack Roe Soup and it was meh. There was plenty of egg but the soup base wasn't refreshing (my fellow Koreans know what I am). My non-Korean friend got Soon Doo Boo and really enjoyed it though. \n\n4. The service is mixed. This is a Americanized Korean restaurant but the service is closer to a Korean restaurant. You have to call the waitress if you need anything since they won't check up on you. They don't greet you when you walk in. It didn't bother me since I'm used to this culture. However, they did forget one of my orders so we just cancelled it. The server who waited our table was kind and respectful.\n\n5. The prices are fairly-priced/on-the-cheaper-side. Soon Doo Boo was $10, Pollack Roe Soup was $13. Prices range greatly from $8 appetizers to $30 shared dishes. That's a pretty good deal for SF.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this place to non-Koreans or Koreans who haven't tried true Korean food from Korea. It is a really hip place to go on a weekend with some friends. It's fun and the crowd is young. Don't expect to get quality food or anything, but for the price, it will be worth the trip.", "author": "Shin L."}

Sure SF doesn't have good KBBQ, but there are some pretty solid Korean restaurants with delicious Korean food that isn't BBQ too! I usually like to come here after work since it's not too far from work. It's definitely a great hangout spot because the restaurant is pretty big and can accommodate for large parties. The restaurant doesn't get too crowded (or at least the times that I've been there), so you're almost likely to get seated right away.\n\nMy friends and I came here on a Friday night because I was craving Korean food. We decided to do family style and ordered dishes to share among 4 people. We ordered the Galbi, seafood pancake, assorted spam and sausage stew, creamy tok bok ki, and fried chicken wings. Everything was so mouthwatering and delicious. The stew was pretty spicy, but I couldn't stop eating it. The prices are pretty reasonable for the portion sizes.\n\nNotes: The restaurant is located near the Tenderloin, so I don't recommend driving. It can be difficult finding parking since it's a busy area. There's a large TV/projection that plays K-pop music videos. There are two separate restrooms for women and men. The service was food, but it was hard to get the staff's attention since they had many other tables to cater to.", "author": "Sylvia H."}

Granted that this eliminates the headache of identifying a name and building a brand around it, it makes it difficult for regular folks to figure out what cuisine is being served. Anyway Yelp to the rescue. 707 Sutter popped up at the top of the list when searching for Korean food in the Nob Hill area so I decided to give it a try for lunch a couple of days ago.\n\nThe restaurant looks a little run down but is pretty big. For the lunch service only the right hand section was open as there were not many people dining in. I was quickly greeted at the gate and shown to a table in the front and handed a regular menu which had a one page insert for lunch specials. The menu is typical of Korean restaurants and includes  Kalbi, Galbi, Bulgogi, bibimbap, japchae, sundubu etc. \n\nI decided to get the sundubu or the soft tofu soup with beef. After ordering I was quickly served four different types of banchan and ten minutes later had the piping hot sundubu in front of me. There wasn't a lot of variety in the banchan but the kimchi was really good. The sundubu was also great. It had a great depth of flavor without being too spicy or salty. Overall I was pretty happy with what I got.\n\nMost of the lunch specials were around the $10 mark so they were about 20% cheaper than Zzan their nearest competitor in the area. Service was fast and efficient. This was not the best sundubu that I'd ever had but it was pretty good and definitely much better than what I had at Zzan a couple of days later. I look forward to returning and trying some more stuff off their menu.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

Beautifully decorated, big projector showing k-pop music videos. \n+ Side dishes: barely anything given, some options tasted stale/not fresh and generally, not delicious\n+ Stir fried octopus: Nice spicy flavor, not much octopus honestly and this dish was $18 so I was expecting more\n+ Stone pot bibimbap: The decent part of the meal, plenty of veggies included\n\n- Service: Quite slow and one very rude incident that soured our meal. We asked for an add on of noodles to the stir fried octopus after the server asked us if we wanted any, to which my friend and I both said yes. Dish arrived, no noodles were present, so we flagged down a server and let him know we never received the noodles and it was fine, but could we not get charged for it? He said, \"The noodles should be on the top of the dish, you won't have to dig around for them.\" Okay, thanks for letting us know, but this doesn't change the fact that we didn't find any. I would have expected a few statements such as: \"I'm sorry, let us remake the dish for you\" or \"Sorry about that, we won't be adding on the charge for the noodles\". Instead he made it sound like we should have known immediately that there weren't noodles. Noticing faster or slower wasn't going to change anything as we were going to let him know regardless that we didn't receive what we ordered, which seems to be a typical course of action when eating at a restaurant. When we looked confused, he replied, \"I'm just making a statement.\" To which we were completely baffled. His condescending and aggressive tone was really nothing I've ever experienced in customer service before and I was appalled. I didn't know schooling customers to cover up for your mistakes was a part of being a server. Then he disappeared to the kitchen, came back and stated, \"The server said you two didn't want noodles, so that's why there weren't any.\" Really? You went back to ask for \"confirmation\" and then came back to prove your false point? I was genuinely stunned. Then, when the check came, he came back, and just like I knew he would, he apologized for what happened earlier because...it was time to tip and he realized that his actions may have impacted this crucial moment. \n\nTruly a disappointing experience for us and I won't be returning anytime soon to experience such rude service again.", "author": "Annie D."}

But to be honest, I think it's more accurate to say that I've been here twice that count (30 times)... considering I never remember to check-in whenever I end up stumbling here for some drunchies. \n\nTLDR; 707 is lit. Not because they have amazing Korean food - let's be real, there really aren't any legit Korean restaurants in Downtown SF (or maybe I just have unreasonable DTLA Ktown standards) - but because of the atmosphere. It's a place that is great for any occasion - pregaming, postgaming, casual dining, or just grabbing a drink. \n\nWhy? One, the restaurant is spacious and offers numerous tables to accommodate both large and small parties. Even when it gets packed, the wait is never too long (20 minutes tops). Two, they have a wide selection of alcoholic drinks to cater to guys (beers/soju) and gals (flavored soju). For the gals, I highly recommend ordering the yogurt soju. It's *so* delicious that you will find yourself ordering more and more pitchers, and before you know it the yoju will get to you. Three, I love how this place is always full of life, with a large screen projector playing an awesome selection of Kpop music vids. So atmosphere-wise, this place deserves a 5/5.\n\nThe food here is aite - a 3 at best if you're sober, but *most definitely* a 5/5 if you're a tad bit intoxicated. 707 has the perfect menu to fulfill all your drunchie needs. Want something soupy? The budaejjigae (Assorted Spam and Sausage Stew) with ramen definitely hits the spot. Craving carbs? Can't go wrong with the Kimchi/Seafood Pancake or Dukbokki. Need something fried? The Fried Chicken Wings (comes in spicy or soy garlic sauce) is finger-licking satisfying. \n\nDefinitely come give this place a try; I guarantee you won't be disappointed!", "author": "Cindy L."}

You can ask for refills on the small dishes.  My recommendation is to get the gamja tang and share. It's definitely for 3 people (2 if you're super hungry).", "author": "Ellen K."}

Typically we are looking for a place that is open late and can accommodate groups of 10+.  707 can do both. \n\nI've tried a number of items on the menu including the soft tofu soup, corn cheese, spicy chicken with cheese, and seafood pancakes which are all solid choices.  But, one of the most notable items on the menu is the fried chicken.  The chicken is hot and crispy with a tangy sweet and spicy sauce.    \n\nWith the super nice staff, multiple soju options, and K-Pop being projected onto the wall, 707 has become a staple for me and my friends on late nights.", "author": "Mitch T."}

The challenge is finding a Korean joint in the city that's good and doesn't break the bank. On a recent night, I joined a friend at 707 Sutter as it was SUPER close to my apartment. Glad I did!\n\nWhen you walk in, you add your name on a clipboard and wait for someone to seat you. The staff was efficient and friendly, nothing really worth noting. The place could probably use a little more color: grey walls and minimal art. The focal point for sure would be the Korean television being projected on the wall. I feel like that's the norm for authentic and hip Korean places. KPOP played in the background as everyone enjoyed their meals. \n\nFor dinner, we started with the Fried Chicken Wings with Soy Garlic Sauce for $15. Price seems a little steep but do it! You won't be disappointed! You get 10 HUGE wings doused in this flavorful sweet sauce with a nice hint of garlic. The wings weren't soggy, still had lots of crunch to it and full of meat. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. My meal was the Dol Sot (Stone Pot) Bi Bim Bop for $12. If you like Bops, you MUST get the stone pot. Keeps the food hot and crisps up the rice nicely. This bop includes a variety of veggies including braised spinach, shredded carrots, sprouts and your choice of chicken, beef, pork, seafood or vegetarian. Coupled with the gochujang sauce, it's a meal that will leave your taste buds happy as heck! \n\nOverall, a nice successful evening. The meal was a lot more reasonable than other Korean joints in the area and the food was good. If you're close by, come check them out!", "author": "Rockne H."}

However, I have been here probably 10 times and loved everything we have ordered. I usually go with a good sized group of friends, and we share everything, so I have tried quite a few things from the menu. My favorite is the kimchi pancake, their spicy wings (be warned that 10 big wings come in an order. This app could easily feed 4) and the stir fried glass noodles with kimchi. I also like the variety that comes in the complimentary appetizer/snack thingy they bring you after you place your order (fun fact for Korean food newbies like me, it's called banchan, and it 's yummy and freeee!) \n\nThe environment isn't fancy or trendy, but they do have a huge screen playing Korean pop music videos, so those are fun to watch. Service has always been fine. The people who work there seem to stay busy and try their best. If you're in the hood and looking for good full service Korean food, 707 is definitely worth a visit.

Everything was delicious and it really felt like an authentic Korean experience\n\nWe came in with no reservation and even though we had 5 people, we were seated at the large round table very quickly. Korean restaurants typically serve a few small plates of free appetizers prior to the real appetizers or entrees, and 707 was no different. There was also K-pop music playing in the background and a projector displaying the associated music video on the wall, which definitely helped add to the vibe.\n\nFor an appetizer we ordered the spicy rice cake with fish cake and vegetables and opted to get the ramen noodles added. It was delicious, with chewy rice cakes and lots of flavor! \n\nWe then moved onto our entrees. I ordered the dumpling soup, and it was definitely one of the better soups I've ever had. The dumplings simply fell apart in the soup and the broth was simple but full of flavor. I particularly enjoyed the strong taste of onions in it! \n\nOne of my dining partners ordered the seafood pancake, as we have in the past. As always, it was also very delicious, with a healthy portion of seafood baked in and cooked to perfection. We saved a few pieces for reheating the next day and even then, they were awesome!\n\nAll in all I was really satisfied with 707 Sutter. It lives up to everything in the surrounding area too, making this area a perfect place to try and find dinner on a weekend!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-12-06", "description": "8/31/16:  As random as random can be, somehow I ended up at a Korean restaurant with a trendy downtown name that normally would be associated with bars lined with $3k cognac bottles, possibly the brainchildren of once-celebrity chefs, and definitely big dollar bills....\n\nBut... it's just straight up Korean.\n\nSure, they did their best to fulfill the destiny associated with their name, like an Alice must be an Alice, and a Bob is always a Bob.... 707 must.......... be scorched in darkness, with random films being projected onto the walls, and of course, most importantly hot young Korean girls to serve you.\n\nThe food?  Surprisingly they got some of the more scary stuffs, which would be quite impressive given their location and... again, their name....\n\n1. Banchan:  Probably one of the least impressive spreads I've seen.  Definitely less than expected given the ultra trendy environment and location.  Just 2 lunchbox-style plastic plates with a total of 6 simple snacks.  3/10\n\n2. Rice cake with cream sauce $15 \"creamy tteok bok ki\":  Okay.... this was awesomeness!  Think of it as Korean mac & cheese.  You got that chewy Asian rice cake, cylindrical, like non-hollow macaroni, and a great creamy sauce.  Only thing, $15 is far too expensive for some Asian mac & cheese without even a piece of truffle or lobster.  But, if you can ignore the price, it tastes really damn good.  7/10\n\n3. Pollack roe soup $13 \"al tang\":  So, basically just your very standard tofu soup, minus the tofu but with very very non-standard bursty brainy bubbling things floating around with blue veins.  ROE!!!  Well, I LOVE caviar, and any kind of roe they got at Mitsua... but... it tastes horrible in soup cause it's just hard and all that amazing fishy saltiness gets sucked away.  And again, add to that a very standard level Korean soup, it just ain't that impressive.  They would do far better to just drop the roe in at the very end, uncooked, half raw inside--that would be sooooo much better tasting.  2/10\n\n4. Gal Bi $24:  Well, you know what it is.  In this case it's the fancier, large single bone type.  Very charred.  Meat tastes great.  But it better be damn good for $24!!!  Well, for that price, I think you'd do better elsewhere.  5/10\n\nI suppose I should give them credit for trying to have a real authentic Asian restaurant in the middle of prime downtown restaurant real estate, but I can't say that their food justifies the price.  Girls were certainly cute though.  I'd come for that.\n\n3/5\n\n#korean #galbi #kalbi #sanfrancisco", "author": "Dean C."}

There was a ton of red sauce, in which at first I thought wasn't that bad when I mixed it with the rice. Towards the end, my rice ended up being soggy after soaking in the red sauce. There are plenty of different seafood meats. It was kind of hard to see which seafood meat I was eating (i'm no expert either). I shared the bibimap with a friend and it was plenty to fill us both up. Probably next time I'll ask for less sauce or have the sauce on the side instead of added into my bibimbap. \n\nI also got the corn cheese and I felt that the corn cheese ($7) can be a pass. I felt that it either needed more butter or more cheese because there is some sort of flavor lacking. \n\nConsidering this is San Francisco, I was expected this place to be pricey and expensive but it really isn't. In comparison to San Jose's Korean restaurant food, 707 Sutter is actually pretty affordable/cheaper. After my table got seated, there was already a wait coming out the door.

Definitely put the sauce it comes with inside yours and let your rice sizzle and become crisp before mixing!

Prices are reasonable for the portions. The spicy chicken wings (sauced with gochujang, so they're a bit sweeter, much stickier, and a little more fermented than you might expect, and perfectly cooked) are quite substantial: they could easily be split by a party of 4 as an appetizer. I went twice on a recent trip, once by myself late at night when little else was open after my flight to SFO had been delayed, and again the following evening with friends attending the same conference. \n\nThe spicy chapchae was some of the best I've had in years: very flavorful, delightfully chewy, with bits of vegetable and BBQ pork. Bibimbap was solid but nothing fancy. The panchan varied a bit from visit to visit, but included a number of options including a delicious kimchi, great marinated spinach, and strips of fish cake.

Stepping inside, you immediately see the big projector screen covering the right side of the wall with Kpop music videos showing. Don't get distracted by it! As soon as you walk in, find the clipboard and put your name down. Then proceed to dance in place as you watch the next ten Kpop videos play. \n\nPROS:\n-Open late until 2am! Yay for the late night owls!\n-Lots of food options to choose from compared to other restaurants\n-Unique items like creamy ddukbokki and cheese corn\n-Good for large groups\n-Giant screen playing Korean MVs\n\nI've been here two times and so far, I really like this place. The location is a bit far out for me and prices are slightly pricey but the food is solid.\n\nCREAMY DDUKBOKKI\nIt's sooooo good. The rice cakes are super soft and not too chewy. The sauce has a bit of a spicy kick but it's not overpowering. I'm not sure what they put in the sauce to make it so addictive but it has a slight tomato-y vodka sauce taste in my opinion. Whatever it is, I want to eat it every single day. \n\nFRIED CHICKEN\nI tried both the spicy sauce and the soy garlic sauce. I highly would recommend the soy garlic over the spicy because the spicy is SPICY! It's literally a whole bowl of gochujang sauce mixed in I think because my mouth was on fire! And I really like spicy foods in general so if you have a strong tolerance, go for it. It was still quite good just that the pain and the tears made it hard for me to go on. The soy garlic was good but not the best I've had in the city. They give the standard side dishes and it's pretty good! We certainly ate everything given before our first dish even came out. \n\nAtmosphere-wise, it is great for large groups because there is a lot of open space and the bathroom is nice and clean.

However, it turns out all the meat was hiding underneath the ramen square. There was actually lots of meat and at the end we couldn't finish it all. I have a low spice tolerance, so I was scared it would be too spicy, but it ended up being perfect. It was very savory, but naturally sweet at the same time. The savoriness came from the spam and hot dogs (duh), while the sweetness came from the onions, green onions, and rice cake. I also didn't think I would like the beans that much, but I really did. It also came with two servings of rice (as it's made to be shared between two people). Overall, it was a great experience eating this.  \n\nThe fried dumpling was very yummy and I liked the texture--I thought it was a perfect balance between chewy and crunch. However, it's not super pretty like you might see at ramen restaurants. I also really liked their soy sauce mix. The portion size for this was also very good--it was quite large for an appetizer dish. If you want, you could just order dumplings and eat that as lunch. \n\nI liked the service as well. The waitress was very patient, and the waiter who brought out the budae jjigae pot would come back to help us stir it and adjust the heat etc.\n\nI definitely plan to come back again, and I hope to bring a third or fourth person, so we can try more dishes (in addition to the budae jjigae!!!).", "author": "Sao B."}

The only thing I really liked was the kal bi. It had a nice char and some good flavor. The corn cheese wasn't very cheesy. Kinda reminded me of creamed corn but not as sweet. The spicy pork neck soup was just salty and not spicy at all. The steamed pork feet were okay, but I found it more gelatinous from the skin than meaty. Out of the chicken wings, the soy garlic sauce ones were better than the spicy sauce ones. But both didn't really satisfy my wing craving though. They were also mushy. I had a couple bites of the fish cake in the rice cake dish. I didn't care much for it as it was just gooey and didn't have much flavor.\n\nMy main complaint is that we didn't receive any rice or banchan from our meal. Isn't that standard with Korean food? Since we had some kimchee at home, I just busted out our homemade kimchi courtesy of the roommate's mom. Someone from the restaurant did contact me after I posted a tip, asked my name and offered to give me a free appetizer the next time I ordered from them. (How I'm going to get my free app, I'm not sure as she didn't follow up after I replied to her.) She said she asked the Postmates driver if we wanted rice and he said no, so I guess it wasn't really their fault. But even without the rice, the food wasn't very good.\n\nSince they made an effort to make up for the lack of rice, I'm giving them 2 stars instead of 1.

Sadly, this was the best of the items I ordered.\n\nSpicy Chicken Wings - 2/5 - These were way too sweet and way too gooey while failing completely at having any kick or spiciness to it. There are so many better places to get asian wings around to ever come here for this.

That doesn't even take into account the dryness and lack of flavor of the meat.

K-Pop music videos are projected on one wall, which was fun. \n\nAs far as food, I always appreciate the complimentary banchan in Korean restaurants. They had seaweed, kimchi, fish cakes, black beans, & sprouts (sorry, couldn't tell you the legit Korean names). We got corn cheese to start, which was crazy good if you love corn & you love cheese! \n\nI got bi bim bop with spicy pork in a stone bowl (2 dollars more for the stone, but hey, why not? go for it) and it was very flavorful. Friends got a shrimp fried rice in egg omelette and one of the stews (sorry, couldn't be bothered to pay much attention to their food), but everyone was happy with their dish.\n \nI think only one waitress was working, but she was friendly and hustled.

They get enough business it looks like. The only thing I wanted more of was the banchan, they were pretty good. No wonder why they have plates of three instead of little individual side bowls. I'm glad that we had gotten here early enough before the crowds of people, so our food came out pretty quickly, too.

I like that they show Kpop videos on the wall via projector and it is loud so don't expect anything less than loud alcohol filled patrons. The area is a bit shady and is hard to find street parking but 707 Sutter does Budaejigae (army stew) surprisingly well. It's called army stew because in Korea when it was cold, the soldiers in the milirary didn't have much to eat or options so they threw in a bunch of run of the mill ingredients and there you go. \n\nThe broth was flavorful and not as spicy as it looked as is the case with most Korean stews. The broth reminded me of the taste of kimchi stew. The budaegijae here has everything from sliced rice cake, instant ramen noodles, spam, sausage, jalapenos, carrots, and beans. This was the first place that serves beans inside the stew which was a bit odd but they're easy to avoid and brush to the side. This stew is plentiful and can easily serve 3-4 people depending on appetites. \n\nThe spicy chicken wings were good as well. The wings and drumsticks had a lot of meat on them and the exterior had a nice crunch but were not very spicy. I'd give the wings 3.5 stars and would have appreciated more of a kick with heat. \n\nThis is a good spot to get drinks and have some wings among other typical Korean bar grub.", "author": "James H."}

While we waited, I was pretty thirsty, and eventually I couldn't wait any longer and asked for a glass.  I learned that service starts once everyone arrives and is seated, otherwise you'll be pretty much be ignored.\n\nBanchan that were served were pretty tasty for the most part.  The banchan were served on a plate with small slots, which included kimchi, beansprouts, green rapeseed veggies, sweet soybean, and fish cake.  Of the banchan, the worst was the kimchi-- it was spicy but bland in flavor... I think they forgot to toss in the salt or the fish sauce when they made the kimchi.  \n\nI ordered the haemul dolsot bibimbap (seafood bibimbap in stone pot) which was pretty standard (tasty and fresh) when comparing other bibimbaps I had at other Korean joints.  You can never really go wrong with bibimbap at any Korean place.  By the way if you like your bibimbap rice to crisp up in the stone pot, the seafood bibimbap doesn't really allow for it.  Why? Because the seafood that is added to the bibimbap is \"marinated\" in a wet sweet chili (I think predominantly gochujang) that makes the rice wet/soggy. Sad times...

My friend (who grew up in Korea) was literally sweating drips of sweat because of the spice from the fried rice, and the sausage stew. There are spicy and non-spicy options on the menu, but just be aware that they are not kidding when they label their food spicy. Personally, I'm a big fan of spicy food, so I really enjoyed the meal.

The restaurant has a nice, relaxed atmosphere, and they also play music videos on the wall, while you eat. As far as Korean food goes, this place is worth checking out.", "author": "Andrew L."}

So off we go around 1230am, because I had just gotten off work, and there were only a few parties there. We were seated immediately and were given the menu. Since as I mentioned earlier, it was our first time there, we turned to Yelp to give us advise on what to order.\n\nBased on this, we ordered the seafood tofu soup for $11 (seafood soon doo bu) - this was DELICIOUS. I was craving korean tofu soup, and I loved the flavor of 707's soup: spicy but not unbearably spicy. The pieces of seafood were perfect, and I appreciated that they used peeled, deveined shrimp - because I have had this soup with shrimp still completely in shell and it was not a fun experience. \n\nIn addition to this, we also had the kimchi fried rice for $10 - delicious! We also ordered the yogurt soju (small for $15) and the fried chicken wings half and half (regular fried chicken and the house special sauce - 10 pieces x $14) - this we could've passed on, it was the least impressive fried chicken I'd ever had. The regular fried chicken was dry and flavorless - literally just salt and pepper. The house special sauce was too tart and not at all spicy, we literally tried one of each wing and took it to go. Last but not least we loved the yogurt soju! It tasted like yakult with the right mix of alcohol and yogurt - not too sugary! \n\nAll in all, we had a good time. The k-pop music videos playing on a screen on the wall were very amusing and some of the songs made us pull out our phones and shazam them! The tables are spread out very nicely (unlike other Korean restaurants where you're literally elbow-to-elbow w/ other patrons) with a nice open space.The restaurant got insanely busy right after we arrived, and the servers got a little busy, but we didn't hold this against them.

Just stale, like a stale cracker, but in the form of a noodle. Anyway, refills were free, and we were provided more of the stuff, but even less variety. Meh, I'm not impressed.\n\nGal Bi - This dish was tasty and was a large portion. By large I mean larger than most korean places serve this dish. The meat was tender, juicy, succulent, (am I being redundant now?). There were two large meat-in-bone pieces that I can appreciate. I don't see that too often, but I see it once in a while.\n\nKimchi Jjigae - This was perfectly spicy, with kimchi and tofu. It was very delicious though a bit on the saltier side.

Basically like a seafood pizza for those who've never had it before. Sliced into 6 pieces I think. Perfect for sharing. \n\nGarlic soy chicken wings: (5/5) I think this was our group's favorite. Comes with 11 pieces so I forfeited my second piece. :'( Chicken was marinated very well and the flavor really gets into the meat, unlike other places where the flavor seems to be only on the skin that peels off the meat too easily. \n\nRice cake in cream sauce: (4/5) It was not at all what I expected, in fact it tasted italian and I loved it. Although it has a spicy symbol next to it, it wasn't spicy. \n\nMAINS: \nKimchi fried rice: (5/5) I got to this dish last and my friends had already devoured most of it. It was damn good and I love the fried egg on top .. though I didn't get to taste it...\n\nSpicy pork: (5/5) I don't eat spicy things (weak I know) but I thoroughly enjoyed this dish. Ate several pieces and dealt with the spicyness. This was probably the spiciest thing we ordered (because the others just weren't spicy at all.) I guess if you really want spicy here, you gotta ask for it. \n\nJapchae with beef/veggies: (4/5) The consistency of the noodles was nice and chewy, and the noodles were flavorful.

Appears to not have a wait during weekday lunches. Ordered the lunch size of Beef Bibimbab with beef on stone and bu dae jji gae. The bibimbab was delicious; the rice used in this dish is smaller grained than the rice that I normally eat, which added more texture to this dish. The bibimbab tasted great! The bu dae jji gae was so delicious. It was a little salty as expected since there was both spam and hot dog, but I loved it! The \"broth\" was so thick, spicy, sweet and had a strong kimchi and beef flavor! I would buy this \"broth\" and eat it was everything all day if I could.\n\nBeware: if you have a short lunch break, I suggest getting bibimbab in a bowl instead of stone because it was just too hot to eat. If you order the du dae jji gae, ask for a small bowl to cool the stew since it was too hot to eat straight out of the stone bowl.\n\nOverall, I loved the two dishes we ordered and the yummy side dishes. We both had leftovers to bring home since we couldn't eat all the hot rice and hot stew.", "author": "Jennifer H."}

My thought bubble exclaimed, \"I'm too old for this room. Go to Shalimar where you belong with the other daredevil geriatrics.\" But the young waitress ensnared me with an innocent \"Table for one?\" I hesitantly nodded as I scanned the restaurant and saw all the youngsters with their Korean barbecue and bottles of soju (photo: http://bit.ly/15IZuL8). Clearly this was not Brothers, but it wasn't HRD Smokin' Grill either. The hipster factor was cranked up but not the edginess you would expect from such a club-like ambiance.\n\nIt's more like the Tendernob version of the Castro's Kpop serving about the same level quality of Korean eats (review: http://bit.ly/10cAB2x) but with a bit more authentic menu like you would find at Dong Baek a few blocks away. I took advantage of the difference by ordering more than I should have, but first I received the regulation banchan. Only four little servings in a subdivided plate, rather paltry by Sahn Maru or even Brothers standards, but probably just as well (photo: http://bit.ly/15G1S5G). I then moved to my starter, the $8 Tofu Salad, which consisted of a rather hefty serving of soft tofu sliced into a dozen pieces and accompanied by a pile of mixed greens.\n\nIt was all drizzled with their house dressing which had a nice miso flavor to it, so it was relatively easy to devour too quickly as I did (photo: http://bit.ly/17W3Tdd). Good stuff but nothing that exceptional and probably a larger portion than what I bargained for when I ordered my main dish. I must have gone over the deep end when I asked for the $17 Jok Bal as the large platter serving was meant for a small band of skinny bar hoppers. But I didn't complain because I was hungry. It's described as \"pork feet\" but it's actually a pork shank that's been steamed, braised in a broth, completely deboned, and sliced thinly. As you can see, the bones make up the centerpiece of the dish (photo: http://bit.ly/YNMEEf).\n\nHuge, huh? Yes, and give credit to the waitress who didn't raise an eyebrow when I ordered it without apology. I was only able to devour about a quarter of it before raising a white flag. I think the fact that it's a dish served like a salumi dampened my appetite a bit since lukewarm pork does not excite me no matter how tasty it was. And it was in a slightly gelatinous way that had me stuffing my mouth with alarming frequency. But I stopped. I slid the porky remains into a large take-out box and slithered out of the restaurant hoping none of the hipsters saw any of my gluttonous behavior. Good thing they were all bopping to the video. I didn't know Lady Gaga was Korean.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...good dishes, not great but good enough and plenty of it\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...ah, to be young again\nSERVICE - 4 stars...quite attentive and not judgy\nTOTAL - 3 stars...Korean goes K-Pop and the world goes 'round", "author": "Ed U."}

Best decision of the night.\n\nBeing a Thursday around 10, it wasn't too busy and our party of 7 got seated right away.  First off, the bonchon is pretty good, presented in a nice long fancy tray.  A little light at first, but you can ask for more.  We got Bulgogi, Dukboki, Cheese Corn, and KimChee Pancake.  I like all of it.  The bulgogi was savory, a little sweet, and slighty crispy, just the way I like it.  The pancake itself was okay, but the ponzu sauce with it was really good!  On the spicy, which I love!  The dukboki was good as well, solid, again the sauce being the standout.  Now the cheese corn, normally I'm whatever about cheese corn.  But this one, this one right here...this one is good!  It was almost like Mac & Cheese because of its creamy, cheesy, garlicy goodness!!! YUM!!!\n\nPlace is spacious so you don't have to stand around in the a little doorway waiting on 5 tables.  Videos and music make it fun.  And staff is friendly and responsive.\n\nWe also had a large carafe of Yogurt Soju, that seemed to keep going!

After a while we really wanted to settle to a spot and just sit and rest, eat some good food. We came to the suggestion of having Korean food, since we were craving the tofu soup. We walked 30 minutes to this restaurant from where we were at that moment, and walked into a store that had not a single customer. Alarmed, we began to step back out since we thought it was one of those restaurant that has break hours. To my surprise, someone stepped up and greeted us.\n\nTo cut it short here were the food we ordered:\n\n1) Beef Tofu Stew: I thought the appearance was really appetizing, the steaming heat really appealed to me. I thought the waitress was going to crack the egg for me, like other restaurants, but that wasn't offered. I guess that just might not have been a routine done everywhere? The taste of the tofu soup was honestly quite average. There were large chunks of onions, which I was not quite used to. And the beef was honestly almost no where to be seen. I came by a few small bits, but it just didn't fit the title of a Beef Tofu Stew... without much beef? \n\n2) Kimchi Glass Noodles: My friend ordered this plate and to our surprise, it was pretty spicy. It did have a chilli pepper next to it's sign on the menu, but we just didn't expect the spice to be that overwhelming. I definitely think this plate was well seasoned, the flavoring was good. I personally enjoyed the spice. But for other people who may just see this as a mild, I would consider this as a medium spice level.\n\nAs for the side dishes that were provided with our meal, very basic. Simple.

Don't hesitate and head over to 707 Sutter. This isn't an ideal date spot (way to loud), but probably one of the best places you can go to if you're looking to host a small to large group of people with food and drinks.\n\nThe quick and dirty:\n- Korean comfort food, nothing fancy, but hits the spot\n- They serve soju and giant beers (you should do them both, at the same time)\n- Giant screen displaying the latest kpop videos\n\nFood:\nMy favorite dish at 707 is the Budae Jjigae (), which is a large spicy bowl of soup w/ ramen noodles, sausage, spam, hamburger meat, and a variety of vegetables. It's pretty big, so you want to go with a group (serves about 4 for a bowl of soup).\n\nAnother must have is the Cheese Corn. If you haven't tried it yet you're missing out. Brown sugar, cheese, all melted over corn served on a sizzling platter. It's a crowd-pleaser.\n\nAmbiance:\nThe staff, food, and music give off the vibe of a busy Seoul street cafe, but the restaurant's facade feels more like a office space converted into a dining area. Don't worry, you'll quickly forget about the tile floors and honeycomb ceiling once you're 3 rounds in. The place has open seating, which is pretty much first come first serve (fill out a white board wait list). They have groups of small black tables that can be joined together to form seating for larger parties. I typically go on Fridays, which are packed if you show up late. Expect waiting at least 30 minutes if you have a large group. It's not uncommon for the floor to erupt into boisterous laughs and clanking of glasses as parties toast the night away. In the background is kpop music blazing through small speakers and a giant projection of music videos on the side wall.\n\nService:\nThe wait staff is super friendly and as attentive as they can be considering the number of tables they are waiting on, however, you might find yourself wandering up to the front desk to order a few rounds of drinks from time to time. \n\nPro tip(s): as soon as you get seated, figure out what the group wants to eat, and have one person order for the entire table (including drinks). Rely on the same person to place the subsequent drink orders. I find food/drinks come out much faster if the server only has to deal with one person. Set your group up with 2 or 3 rounds of drinks in advance so you give the staff plenty of time to catch up.  This is a family style dining restaurant, I highly recommend ordering several different dishes for the table, instead of everyone having their own dish, the portions are large and are more suited to be shared.", "author": "Jasper S."}

Occasionally there will be a love song which is a guy being very emo singing and the camera showing him wearing a sweater sitting in various places....but I digress.\n\nWe ordered tofu bimbimbap, kimchi tofu soup, stir fry squid, and bulgogi. The tofu soup and squid are both pretty spicy --there is no American spicy level here, just one level of spicy, so if you are used to wimpy spicy food levels, don't order spicy food here (clearly marked on menu). The bimbimbap was nice as in, very healthy which is what I wanted. But the stone pot was very hot and I wasn't warned and ended up getting a burn mark on my arm -_- they also didn't give me the typical red sauce that usually goes with bimbimbap.

So, when I'm in a city like SF I want to take advantage of the spoils of Asian food bounty. I hadn't had Korean food in a while, so it was on my mind. I convinced a skeptical friend to come with (it's not really fair; she has her pick of awesome Asian eats on the regular; I was operating on a deficit) and we were on our way. We arrived to an empty restaurant and the side-eye came out in full. As I attempted to slide under the table, our incredibly nice server came by to take our orders. Whew! This woman was so genuinely nice that you just wanted to smile back at her and radiate in the kindness. This, too, is lacking from general experiences in Miami, so I drank it up.\n\nCaught up in her warm smile, we started the meal off with a pitcher of strawberry soju. Yeah, not the best of ideas. I've been drinking since the age of [redacted]. I've been drinking overly sugary beverages since much earlier than that. Strawberry soju should have not been an issue at all for me. It.was.rough. After downing the pitcher (what? It was paid for and at $25 I got what I paid for), I almost immediately got a headache. Oy. Empty restaurant. Bad. Nice waitress. Good. Strawberry booze. Bad. Very bad.\n\nHoping that the booze wasn't a sign to come, we started in our our huge order of grub. BiBimBap with plenty of rice, spicy pork and banchan was a mixed bag. The bibimbap and pork were very good. The rice was cooked well and there was a lot of it. The banchan was... eh. No one orders food for banchan; I get that. But when the banchan offerings don't match up to the entree, it's a bit of a letdown. A bit. My dining partner was bit more over the moon for the mackerel than I was. It was good but not great. What *was* great, however, was the kim chee pancake. Texture, flavor and quantity, it satisfied on all levels.\n\nAs you've read, the food was a mixed bag and the drink almost knocked me out for the night so... 4 stars? Yes. Why? K-Pop. It had been out of my life for much much too long and it's such a wonderfully guilty pleasure. Horrible videos. Love interests that make no sense. Outfits out of Lady Gaga's nightmares. Hoodrats (I love the 'rats).

Not sure if we just got unlucky. I also ordered the ramen dukbokki which is pretty good. The chicken katsu was very good though. I'd eat that again if I went there.\n\nIn terms of service, I just feel like there are normally 2-3 people circling this place, but majority of the time that they are out on the floor they are serve food and then immediately go back to the kitchen. Its a little less common that there were servers who were just out on the floor to just assist customers. We always felt we'd have to yell/ stare at them to get their attention. At time it felt that we stared at them so long that we could see their souls. We learned the history of their lives, their likes, their dislikes, their quirks, what makes them and their souls just so beautiful, and sometimes...even what sort of pets they might have. And then close to the point of epiphany and strong spiritual connection with them...they'd finally turn around or one of us would just get up to get their attention.\n\nNot sure if this is a result of just short staffing, or just short staffing the two times I came here, but it makes eating here not the most efficient experience.\n\nIf you're in the tenderloin and just suddenly want Korean food, this place will still hit the spot.", "author": "Derrick C."}

For appetizers, we ordered the corn cheese and potato croquettes. The corn cheese was slightly too sweet for my preference, and potato croquettes were dense and under-seasoned. We also shared a kimchi fried rice with vegetables. The egg was cooked perfectly and the rice was flavorful with the kimchi. For my main course, I ordered the soft tofu soup with vegetables. The soup was rich and flavorful and the tofu was smooth and soft. Good balance of soup to vegetables as well and I enjoyed it. I ordered a bowl of white rice to go with my soup. I don't eat much spicy food, so be sure to ask if they can do a mild spicy level if you're like me.

Came back for late night dinner and ordered the jok bal (steamed pork hog) and seriously, this is not an appetizer and is not for 2 people. It's so much food that it's easily for 5 or more people and at some point, we were tired of it.\n\nAlso had the soon doo bu again but this time it was not spicy at all! Was quite disappointed as I missed the hot spicy soup. However, this time they brought the egg separately and we cracked into the soup. So my suspicion of last time that the egg was not there was likely the case.\n\nThe chicken gizzard skewer this time was pre-cooked and microwaved up as they were very dry and shrunk to small meatballs. They were a bit hard to chew on. The chicken skewer and soon doe skewer (Korean sausages with spicy sauce) were a little bit better.\n\nThe soju drink was alright and not too sweet.\n\nService was still excellent.\n\n*************************\n\n(See pics) Review #1358. More of 3.5 stars for now and would be higher if it's not for the raw gizzards. Soon du bu is definitely definitely making me hot and sweaty.\n\nThis is a changing scene city, with new eateries opening up all the time, even long time places were gone, long time as in anything that has opened for more than a few years. And this spot was vacant for quite some time and finally another Korean spot is open (there are only 2 within walking distance) about 10 days ago.\n\nIn a fizzy drizzling evening, a hot soup base dish would totally warm up the chilly night.\n\nThe seafood du bu ($11) was piping hot and you can see big bubbles bubbling up. This is one of my Korean favourite dishes. The broth was excellently spicy heavy and can make one drip sweat. The taste was very flavorful and the bowl was filled with lots of tofu, mostly squids and a couple shrimps. Was hoping to find a couple other items though. Also and unfortunately, only some egg white was found and not the full egg even they did say it's cooked with the soup. The rice that came with was good and perfectly absorbed all the spiciness and was very filling.\n\nAlso got the chicken gizzards / hearts ($5). Sadly out of the 2 skewers (8 total) there were 4 that were raw! Did point it out to the server as a note. They might have had forgotten that order as it arrived after the tofu soup.\n\nAs usual, there were complimentary small pickled dishes but only 4 while other places usually have 6 - 8. But they all tasted pretty decent.\n\nThey also serve beer, sake and flavoured soju drinks but had not tried any at this visit.\n\nThere is a projector playing K-pop MTV on the wide wall with GREAT sappy love songs playing that were not too loud, just enough as a background. The place is spacious with dim light.\n\nService was very friendly though a bit slow but not too bad.\n\nThere are many other items on the menu such as appetizers, noodle soup, full entrees with mackerel and spare ribs, as well as hot pots and bibimbap, so will definitely come back to check those out, especially since they open until 2am every night except Sunday nights which is until midnight.", "author": "T L."}

So when someone suggests we eat Korean food in SF, I automatically think to myself \"Should we take the chance of possible mediocrity to people please and satisfy the whims of others?\" And in this case, I said \"Okay\" while my insides filled with doubt.   \n\n707 Sutter was empty when we arrived with only one other couple eating dinner. Not gonna lie, it was awkward, and this is why no one wants to eat in an empty restaurant. We were seated by a very nice server and perused through our menus. We decided on a kim chee pancake, stone pot of bulgogi, and a grilled fish (can't quite remember if it was mackerel). To start they served a variety of ban chan which was not horrible, but not impressive either. These days the worst thing you can be is \"not memorable.\" Our main entrees however were DELICIOUS! The balance of flavors and textures were all right on point, and I gave my friend Johnny T a big high-five for not picking a loser restaurant.\n\nThe downside of our meal had to have been the strawberry soju pitcher which was $25. It's a deal when you think about how many drinks you get and for you fellas who are looking to close the deal, this is your perfect vehicle. It tastes like you're drinking kool-aid and it's very easy to get completely wasted. Which of course makes your date more sexually attractive and exponentially more interesting. Our soju had weird chunks of ice in it and the flavor just wasn't there. But I still drank it!\n\nThe cherry on top of our kim chee sundae was the medley of K-Pop videos which were projected onto an entire wall. Watching K-Pop is like driving by a horrible car accident. You know you shouldn't stop to look, you know you should feel bad for being wanting to see the chaos, but you cannot help yourself. You are completely fascinated by the awfulness of the entire situation. K-Pop is AWFUL. But we could not stop watching it and we are still talking about how fun those videos were. \n\nBack Street Boy + Spice Girls + Justin Beiber Hair + Hello Kitty + Everything In Korean = K-Pop AWESOMENESS", "author": "Emi H."}

Usually, from the previous restaurant/bar places like this that I've been to, their food is only so-so, and their drinks are what they specialize in because that's what brings in the profits.  \n\nNot so here.  The food is so amazing.  I have been here twice already and I keep getting cravings to go there again!  The first time, I got soft tofu soup-kimchi flavor, which is unusual for soft tofu soups.  Usually, they have the different meats, then vegetable, and seafood, but usually not kimchi.  That's why I usually just get kimchi jigae.  The flavor was just perfect; I ordered it extra spicy to suit my preference.\n\nThe second time I got the bu dae ji gae with my boyfriend and our housemate, and it was amazing.  I will always get that if I go with more than 1 other person from now on.  The flavor of the broth was so rich and perfect.  Careful, the ramen noodles can get overdone quick, so bring someone who's experienced with watching it.\n\nMy boyfriend reports that the kimchi fried rice is the best he has ever had, and specifically, the pork one is better than the shrimp one (he tried both).  \n\nOne of the best parts about this place is that it's not too crowded ever (at least when I went) but it's never eerily quiet or empty either.  With kpop streaming in the background and always at least 1 to 2 other tables, it's easy to settle right in and get to ordering some amazing Korean food.", "author": "Charmaine D."}

They start you off with a nice display of banchan that varies a little depending on what they have. I love their kimchi, and sometimes the japchae comes as an appetizer as well. Both times I've gotten the hot stone bibimbap, which comes with a generous portion of rice, veggies, and the meat of your choice. The ratio of each is perfect, and the rice gets super crispy at the bottom due to the heat of the stone bowl. \n\nI've also tried their spicy rice cakes, which come with fish cakes and a slightly sweet and spicy sauce. It's a heavier dish, but exactly the kind of carb-heavy food you want on a cold day. They have a lot of variety on their menu, from noodles to rice dishes to snacks, and I'll definitely be back to try everything out!", "author": "Ashley T."}

Very little travels into the building with tinted windows and few light sources inside. A huge projector is displaying Korean music videos and dramas on the wall. Kpop is being played incessantly but not too loud to obstruct conversation. \n\nStaff is super friendly. They were very courteous and apologized when the food was slightly delayed and gave us a estimate when our dishes would arrive.\n\nWe made three orders: Japchae, Kimchiee fried rice, and Fried Chiken wings sauted in pepper sauce.  \n\nThis is where i have to knock on their performance. Portions were slim, from the entrees to the banchan they serve on small sauce trays. The Japchae and Kimchee fried rice was nothing spectacular . The only saving grace was the Fried Chicken Wings. We felt they didn't skimp on this plate as they gave us roughly 8-10 wings. The texture combined with the pepper taste gave it an amazing sweet tang that clearly made eating here worth it. I would come back here for multiple orders of chicken wings and nothing else. \n\nOverall trendy atmosphere with mediocre dishes and slim portions.

Came with 3 side dishes which I wasn't happy with because the portions were small. Kimchee,   ( fish cakes) and   (potatoes). Later asking for a refill on our side dishes they said they were out of potatoes.. It was only 6pm, how are they out of side dishes already? Doesn't make sense. Food was good I'll give them that. Probably won't be coming back again but they should really add more side dishes to give it a Korean vibe. We Koreans eat a lot of side dishes, 3 just doesn't do justice.

So after taking our hike across town and arrived at this restaurant we were a bit starving.\n\nThe ambiance was good and we quickly settled at our table and took our order soon after since the place is about half full.\n\nNow, the wait begins. I am not really blaming it on slow-service because there are only a chef in the kitchen and one waitress managing the entire floor. It took over 30 minutes to have our appetizers delivered.\n\nThe foods are good, from the Kimchi that was flavorful and mildly spicy, the seafood pancake that had the perfect crispy char while still showcasing the tender squid and moist interior, the fried rice cooked up fluffy and a bit chewy with a balanced rice to ingredient ratio, I am rather impressed with how the chef was able to prepare food for the entire restaurant by herself non-stop, multi-tasking at its finest delivering quality food.\n\nPerhaps more people showed up to eat because the Ramen fest was too crowded, or perhaps a few people called out sick, I can't help but feel that this place has had some fantastic moments satisfying some serious Korean food cravings; but just not our day.\n\nThe waitress treated us to a \"pitcher-bottle\" of free beer to help us with the wait.

I ordered pork noodle soup by the # indicated on menu, and received some tofu fandango stew instead. People make mistakes, no harm no foul. However, the waitress (1 of 3 people who visited our table, as there seemingly was no designated waiter, just a free for all) told me that this (what was in front of me) was the pork noodle thing i ordered, as if i was stupid or something and could not differentiate between gelatinous chunks of tofu and actual meat. Another telling sign was that my Stew noodle slop fandango came out much earlier than my friend who I was dining with. Instead of just admitting innocent fault (who really cares, I didn't, i just wanted her to bring me the correct food i ordered), the lady argued that it WAS pork...  picture this :literally in front of me sits soup with whiteish looking chunks and are practically vibrating with the korean pop music projected on the wall, and she tells me as if I am blind or something, that'd it is pork... Yeah...\nI ended up having to talk to manager who was honest enough to offer me another dish, though this took up more time as I was on break from work. Unfortunately the second dish -though appreciated was not much better... some chewy noodle cold thing. It was so cold it makes me wonder why on earth it would have taken so long to bring out (refrigerator cold). \nI would not go here again even though the manager did eventually correct the error, because it is way over priced, and not even good, I should have just eaten Ramen or something.  I do not understand why this place is so packed... must be hype or something.", "author": "Ang G."}

Waited in line for a good 20 minutes, and the service was pretty attentive. Pretty loud and not a great space for intimacy, so I'd recommend it more for meeting up with friends than going on a date. The appetizers, although free, weren't great. \n\nWe ordered:\n- Seafood pancake (6.5/10) -- pretty good, crispy, standard pancake, but BURNT quite a bit at the edges so docking points for that. My date enjoyed it regardless.\n- Kimchi Soondoobu (soft tofu) (5/10) -- we asked for mild, because my date can't really handle spices all too well, but it came out more medium, tiptoeing over to hot. Pretty standard soondoobu, but nothing remarkable.\n\nI do recall that we ordered something else as well, but it just shows that most of the food is just like that: unremarkable.

The Tofu soup with beef was EXCELLENT with lots of tofu & just the right spice, not too vinegary.  My friend and I shared Tofu soup and the lunch special box with short ribs.  That was the perfect balance of spicy, salty tart and a tiny bit sweet from the ribs, and the noodles and potatoes made for a good neutral contrast.  I am VERY picky about Korean food and this was DELICIOUS.  No complaints at all.  The server (maybe the owner?) was very attentive and friendly. The check was only about $22 fora big tasty lunch for two.  The food is legit-don't change it!\n\nFor ideas on improvement, I think they may do well to add some plants and more canvas art on the walls to help buffer noise.  We were there in a slow time, but if it was busy I think it may have become pretty loud with the tile floor and high ceiling.

When writing this review i am comparing it to likes of Toyose, Tonight souju bar, Manna and Um Ma Son. These 4 places i mentioned have 2 distinct differences. Toyose and Tonight are more of Soju bars with decent korean food while Mana and Um ma Son are more of the traditional Korean Home style restaurants.\n\nWhy do i mention this? 707 sutter takes the best of both worlds. You Have the soju bar atmosphere with restaurant quality food and service. \n\nAtmosphere/service:\nThis place is huge compared to all the other places i mentioned and is great for big parties. Waitresses are very nice and always ready when you need them. They have a HUGE projector playing Korean music videos that is displayed on a large wall. Sound is very good as well.\n\nFood- \nWe ordered the:\n\nKim Chi Fried Rice: Had to try one of my go-to dishes. We added spam. The texture and amount of sauce is perfect. Not too wet, not too dry. Generous portion of spam and kim chi. I would say that this dish was way better than Tonight Soju Bar and almost as good as Toyose (Very close).\n\nBoo dae jjigae: Enough for 3-4 people. COmes on a hot pot and has a generous portion of ramen, spam, sausage, assorted veggies and a very good soup base. Have had this at many restaurants and this is by far the best.\n\nSoju- For something different try the strawberry. It comes with crushed ice and is perfect with the soups/\n\nSeafood Pancake: just as it sounds. This was perfect.\n\nOverall this is probably one of my new favorites.

I think people are often super stoked to give a 5 star rating, but as I've said in previous posts, unless you're being offered a angelic foot rub on a magic carpet ride, 4 stars is as good as you're going to get from me until otherwise proven.\n\nI walked into 707 and straight away was greeted and seated. Check+. The waitress was very quick and curt. I ordered hot tea and was grabbed at the shoulder 10 minutes later with the waitress abruptly saying, \"Excuse me sir, your tea is just finished boiling and will be right out\". I nodded in a quite startled response, \"thank you\" and carried on writing in my journal. It's not that usual that I come in and dine alone, but I was seated at a modest two-seater table while Korean pop music videos were projected on a large stone wall mesmerizing some of the other seemingly cyborg guests rambling on about their next hookup that couldn't speak Cantonese very well and continued to discredit the civilized nature of people from Hong Kong...the kinds of people in the world, truly, are astounding.\n\nMy tea arrived and order taken: I asked the waitress for the chicken skewer appetizer and the Soon Doo Bu soup with kim chi. While the projections banged on with glitzy Korean pop, food began to arrived by way of several dishes: (1) a small square plate with pineapple topped chicken skewers (three of them) over a small bed of white cabbage. Delicious! (2) a long rectangular dish, very fancy (check+), with five different kim chi vegetables, including broccoli, mung beans, yellow peppers, spicy cabbage, and braised tofu. Delicious again! (3) a small dish with an egg. \"Um waitress?\" Gone - before I had a chance to ask: damn she's just too fast and abrupt! (4) A bowl of rice. (5) Just then, the soup arrived and what a smell. The liquid was still boiling. I let it cool for awhile, and what I fool I am for that idea. Next, I cracked the egg, and would you believe it? The egg was still raw. Apparently, I'm new at this Korean cuisine, because no one informed me whatsoever. I figured it must've been for when the soup came out boiling, for it would've cooked the egg surely! I poured the contents into the soup and began to stir until all of the egg was fully cooked.\n\nBy meal's end, I was fully satisfied. The waitress and waiter continued to clear my table as necessary, checked in on me, and were very polite. My only qualm was wanting to tell the waitress to please slow down. So if you go here, and you suspect the same lightening speed, ask her to slow down!", "author": "Gio M."}

I went back because of the delicious pigs feet dish (that sure is delicious and probably the best dish there and frankly what will bring me back again). Everything else was good, the service seems to be pleasant, and it's your to be expected Korean joint. \n\nThe only gripe is that their free appetizers were anemic one biters that they expect to be shared by 4 ppl... when you come to a Korean restaurant the least you expect to get is lots of diff tasty kim chi dishes before your meal, not the case here... seems rather cheap of them... and frankly I took out 0.5-1 star because of this.\n\nOther than the pigs feet, we had the tofu kim chi soup - good, omu rice - blah (perhaps it's because I've had really good versions of this so the taste was not ketchupy and up to par enough and I was a little disappointed that it didn't bring me back to the days in Asia where I hung out with my Korean friends and did nothing but eat and drink sochu all night. Okay so I had outsized expectations on a simple dish and it didn't live up to the nostalgic memories as hardly anything ever does), kim chi fried rice - much better, and seafood scallion pancake (good but very greasy).\n\nAll in all, decent Korean place to hang with friends and eat & drink till u can't anymore.", "author": "Alice W."}

I've been to JinMi as well. In comparison, this place seems more youthful and the flavors are a bit more hip and Americanized, whereas JinMi is more of the traditional mom made homecooked food which I prefer. But nonetheless 707 is good!\n\nWe ordered galbi, yang nyum tong dak (seasoned chicken wings), and beef soondooboo. Everything was great. The galbi was the best though. It might have been slightly too sweet but it was delicious. The soup and chicken were good but spicy. If you normally eat Korean food, it's the good kinda kick in your mouth spice. If not, you're going to be drinking glasses of water. I've had better chicken back in DC but it was still good. The soup was good but a bit over seasoned. This soup in particular is a more clean soup but there was just a lot of seasoning put into it.\n\nBut all in all it was delicious!\nThe serving sizes were great! But they don't give that many side dishes. And their side dishes are definitely not memorable. I always think you can judge a Korean restaurant based on the side dishes.

They're the best place in the neighborhood, I'm so lucky to live across the street from them!", "author": "Erin H."}

I was diggin' the K pop vibe. Although my friend swears the food is mediocre (she's Korean), I beg to differ. It was a great change in pace compared to mundane New-American cuisine post drinking. Check it out!!!", "author": "Andrew H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-05-28", "description": "Torn between 3 and 4 stars, but this area isn't great for cheap and tasty options, and this place was cheap and tasty. Staff was attentive, the K-Pop videos projected on the wall were entertaining while waiting for food, and the tray of appetizers was tasty and fun to pick at. \n\nWe ordered Bi Bim Bap and Kim Chi fried rice. The latter was very tasty, the former could have had a little more flavour. The side salad that came with the fried rice was a very basic side salad: leaves with too much dressing.", "author": "Jasmine H."}

(i am really picky with my korean food and i liked 707 sutter's so you KNOW they know how to cook their korean dishes.) \n\nin other words, this restaurant will be seeing me more often :D", "author": "The Hangry Chef O."}

First, they DID NOT take my girlfriend and me to table like 5 mins even there are several seats available. Foods were late about 20-30 mins. I understand it, but they didnt give us spoons even we ordered soup and soup was right on my table. I think they should hire 1-2 more waiter/waitress.", "author": "Toby L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-04-10", "description": "NO!  No, no, no, no, no, and no.  Who is paying these reviewers?!  Y'all done let me down, dammit!\n\nFood is tolerable at best, service was nice, but slow and inattentive, and the space/ambiance feels a bit too sterile for me.\n\nI was really excited to try out the new neighborhood Korean joint and went in for dinner with a few friends.  We ordered the chicken skewers, jap chae, beef bibimbap, spicy fried chicken w/special sauce, and one of the beef and dumpling stews (forgot the name).  We were given banchan, but there were only FOUR dishes: tofu, pancake, bean sprouts, and regular kimchi.  Dafuq.\n\nThe skewers was a total joke.  $5 for maybe four bites of chicken/2 tiny skewers--hell to the naw.  While the meat was tender and tasted okay, it was definitely not worth it.  The best dish was the jap chae--full of flavor.  But don't get it twisted.  It was the best dish, not to be confused with a \"delicious\" dish, necessarily.  The bibimbap came out lukewarm and flavorwise, was just mediocre.  Maybe the soup was too spicy for me, but I could barely take down a small bowl of it.  The dumplings in the soup were good, but otherwise, it was just okay.  My party of four could not finish it; though the portion was large.  The fried chicken was especially unpalatable for me.  The \"special sauce\" tasted strange and very artificial.  It was thick, felt heavy taste-wise, and everyone agreed that the chicken needed a rinse.  And I'm not sure what the point of frying the chicken beforehand is--it's completely drenched with the sauce, making it soggy and messy.\n\nI really wanted to like this place since it's new and close to home, but I highly doubt I'll be returning.", "author": "Dwigt K.

Walked in to get take out and restaurant was extremely dark and the music was blaring. It was after 10pm, so I will give them that, but I would still not eat dinner here if this is their normal atmosphere.  Ordered the Kimchi Fried Rice to go...the servers were polite enough, and the food came out within a decent period of time.  But the dish itself is mediocre at best.  It's like hamburger helper made with rice and spice.  Not sure I can finish it it's so unsatisfying.  Not going back.  There's better Korean in San Francisco.", "author": "Julie I."}
