Stumbled in here in the middle of trivia night, fresh off the 1-way fight moving here from Chicago. Literally dropped our stuff off in the empty new place, and headed out to check out the neighborhood. This was the first bar we came across that was serving food, and it looked cool and unpretentious. Perfect - we were hoping to find a new neighborhood local spot to grab beers occasionally, but did not expect to find it so quickly!! Since then we've been in a number of times and I have to say I'm super impressed by how nice everybody is here. Great service, beer selection and awesome people. Scott the trivia host immediately welcomed us and let us catch up in the game, then chatted with us later. Super cool dude. The bartenders are so nice, remembered our names after the first visit, and always make us feel welcome. Thanks Sienna & Shay :)", "author": "Hannah M."}

Hurray! \n\nMy boyfriend and I stumbled upon this joint while waiting for Tortilla Heights to open up just a block away. There was a sign out front advertising a happy hour with $3 cocktails and draughts and $5 moscow mules. That immediately caught my eye and I was delighted to hear they honored happy hour even on Saturday! \n\nImmediately upon sitting at the bartop, our eyes caught glimpse of an actually fishbowl (really a fishtank) that had a Giants stadium background, a baseball sitting at the bottom and two happy angel fish swimming around. There were TVs with the preseason game on and SF Giants accoutrements garnishing the walls of the room.\n\nWe ordered Pacifico on tap and of course took advantage of the $5 moscow mules. We had a lot of time to kill so we asked for dice and were offered a wide array of games they had like Jenga and Apples to Apples by the friendly and helpful bartkeep Sharbel, I believe his name was (Sorry, but I did ask you to spell it for me upon our departure- hope I heard you correctly :). There was a pair of old arcade style hunting games in the corner near the loo as well. \n\nAccording to the literature posted around the bar, there is a trivia night I believe on Mondays and judging from the large PAC12 flag hanging above the front door, you can probably catch these games on their big screens. \n\nWith that said, I'm happy to report that stopping at the Fishbowl on my birthday was a great way to kill a couple of hours.

But, ending up here one night not too long ago I really appreciated having this bar in the neighborhood. Yes, they have TVs with sports playing all the time. Yes, people do come here to get drunk and then hit on passersby as they smoke in front of it. But, the bartenders were nice, the prices were fair, and they have a food menu that they don't cut off too early. When you're tipsy (okay, more than tipsy) those curly fries are AMAZING, our group concluded as we ordered one, then a second, then a third and fourth basket.\n\nSolid place. I think they also have pub quiz trivia night on Mondays, I may have to check it out (though, it's pretty tiny, not sure how many people will fit).", "author": "Ashley L."}

She lives in the Inner Richmond, I live in Presidio Heights, we don't want to go to our usual bar because we don't want to run into everyone we know. She remembers that she wants to watch Heroes, so we have to go somewhere nearby so that she can be home by 9. And we want to take the bus somewhere.

It's a Monday night, it should be empty, and we certainly won't see anyone we know there.\"\nHer: \"Ok, meet me on the bus.\"\nI call G Bar on the way to the bus, only to discover that they're closed on Mondays, so I tell her when I get on the bus.\n\nMe: \"We can go to the bar in the JCC - at that restaurant 415.

IS there any reason for the volume of the music to be so freaking loud??  I went in recently and the bar was dead, but still the music was mindsplittingly loud.  I mean the bar is only 12x12.   It's not like the couple in the corner can't hear the music. The music selection is eclectically 1995 top 40 bad.  The average age of the patrons is 19, and the average drunkeness is very stinking drunk.  I felt like I needed to take a shower when I came out of this bar.", "author": "Spencer G."}

I remember my first ice flinging review clearly, and yet. . . . not here.  Odd.\nI avoid the Fishbowl at all costs normally, and I certainly don't go anywhere near it during peak bar hours.  I am far too old to tolerate the \"very very new to drinking legally in bars\" crowd, even if they are good for my ego as they typically get so drunk that they end up hitting on me.  I can only imagine that through beer goggles (or rather 2 for 1 drink special goggles) I look 10 years younger and 20 pounds thinner.  Or perhaps your potential suitor will throw ice at your table all night to get your attention.  Is this the high school cafeteria?  Did I miss something?  Yeah, they have drink specials, and sometimes the crowd doesn't entirely suck, but that happens about as often as total solar eclipses happen.\nThe only redeeming quality is that you can have food from Frankie's next door delivered to you on your barstool, and the only upside to that is if you were in the mood for hard alcohol with your food since Frankie's doesn't serve liquor.\nAll in all, I'd rather a) sneak a flask into Frankies, or b) get my food from Frankie's to go and head home; both of these are moot points really since who the hell drinks hard alcohol with a burger?!", "author": "Jennifer D."}

I'm not trying to be mean, but it's true.  The point where I said \"I'm never coming here again\" was when what looked like a MAC make-up representative pushed me away from the bar and tried to start a fight with me because she didn't like the shirt I was wearing.

Just the association with frankies is worth a point in my book. The day of the time change (\"spring forward\") we went there at 1:32 am after spending 3 hours earlier in the night at Frankies. I ordered two beers, was served promptly, tipped $4, and immediately upon sitting down, was tapped on the shoulder by a pony-tailed bouncer and told to wrap it up. It was 1:33. I told him i would be happy to leave upon finishing my beer. At 1:35, ive knocked back about half of the beer with haste in an effort to placate the bouncer, when I was grabbed by the shoulder and told that it's time  to go. We proceed to debate (in an effort to give me time to finish my beverage) 1) the rationale for serving me only to kick me out immediately, 2) how some sort of fractional rebate system was in order, and 3) why this was necessary as it wasn't close to 2am. All those things that you would do if you were confronted in such a manner. Were they required to close at 1, and had overrun their alloted time? That would have been a perfectly reasonable response, but instead we were left without answers. Im not an argumentative person and wasn't trying to give the guy a hard time, but i was incredulous as to the situation. Seemingly realizing the folly of his ways, he apologized, ordered us two shots of the whiskey and took one with us. We were more than happy to leave at that point, feeling vindicated, until he looked me square in the eyes and angrily told us to \"Get the F*** out\". We were on the way out the door anyway, so this secured the need for a review. \n\nEveryone else here has always been perfectly nice.

Two nights before our wedding we brought 30 friends back to where it all began and the bartender was nice enough to have the very table we met at reserved for us along with flowers and a card saying \"Where it all began\". My fiancee literally started crying. It was amazing, and we had the perfect ending to an already amazing night. Thank you Fish Bowl and your amazing staff!", "author": "Eric E."}

This is a dive bar at its finest because i want to just dive  in. all the people who work there are fun and friendly. The locals are not sleezy because i am one of them. Some peoples comments confuse me because most of the time the bartenders themselves are singing and having fun. cheap drinks, good jukebox and places to sit. FISH Bowl rocks!", "author": "melissa c."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-10-10", "description": "My new favorite bar in the city.  It's the grunge/dive bar in a little area I like to call the \"Pac. Heights Trough.\" The bartenders are real and have a good sense of humor and if you get sick of the cal alumni/marina crowd at the lions den up the street this is a great place to show up.  I think they have a decent food menu too, but by the time I get there the kitchen is always closed.... This is the only bar in the city I know of that will also sell you half a bottle of J.D. for cheap - ok not really, but they pour that much into their fish bowls, which are definetly worth it.", "author": "Ehren D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-02-28", "description": "as my roommate says it \"fishbowl is like cheers, where everybody knows your name\". this is a neighborhood low key bar that has good drinks, super awesome bartenders who remember you and greet you with a smile, and a happy easy go lucky vibe. its a nice change of pace to have a bar around the corner open to hoodies and sandals amongst the trendy sf spots. if you are looking for a place to catch a game this is a great spot cause they have tvs in every direction. i have even fallen victim to the buck hunter game inspired by their east coasters... dang cows always get in my shot ;) warning, its tends to be a guys bar probably cause of the sports and dive feel.. no complaints at all but its always good to know.", "author": "Barbara C."}

I walked in not knowing what to expect, but knowing full well that I was going on a bender. I was in the mood. The uber-stiff gin and tonics did my soul good, as did the Journey tunes. Oh wait, I think that actually damaged my soul. While I'm on the topic of music, I might as well discuss my one complaint with this oh-so-divey dive bar. I put some money in the juke box, and my songs never came on. When I asked about it, i was told that the bartenders have ultimate authority over what music is played. Cool, 'cept I just wasted my dollar. I know, it's only a dollar, but turn of the juke if you're not going to let people choose. Anyway, I'm pretty sure this is a not-quite-Pac-Heights pickup spot, so if you're looking for love in all the wrong places maybe you should try The Fishbowl. A little shoutout to the bartender, Tony, who took great care of us that night. I was lucky enough to secure a bar stool and had very attentive service. Thumbs up (that's a good way to give a dive bar kudos, right?).", "author": "Lisa F."}

You'd think it is a great place bc it is a chill neighborhood bar, but then you meet Tony - the man who runs both this bar and Frankies burger joint.  He comes off as all smooth and nice, but really he is a THEIF.  My friend and I guest bartended to raise money for breast cancer.  It was a Wednesday night and we packed the bar with our friends and coworkers.  All in all, we made well over $1,000 in tips as everyone was SO generous - individual people handing us $100+ at a time because they wanted to support a good cause.  Despite staying to help clean up until after 3 am on a work night, Tony wouldn't give us our tip money.  He made us show up the following day and gave us some big speech about how \"none of it goes to him and it all goes to us\" and then tried to hand us $200!  I looked at him and was like you are kidding me right??  The previous night, we counted the money and also know how much our friends gave us.  He pulled us outside towards an alley and was like wait here - we will figure this out...he ran away and then came back and sneaked us another $200 as if he was doing a drug trade or something.  I told him he shouldn't be acting so shady because we didn't do anything wrong, in fact, we were raising money to help cancer patients!  In the end, we got a bit more money, but not close to what we actually earned.  After telling other people about our experience, I have heard several stories about how he has stolen from other guest bartenders as well.  I truly hope that people will read this and not support a place that steals from its patrons....", "author": "Colleen S."}
