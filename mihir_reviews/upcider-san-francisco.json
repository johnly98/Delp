The ambiance was nice. The restaurant has an excellent variety of ciders - the most I've ever seen available at a bar or restaurant - and I liked how the menu was organized by state and country. The ciders ranged from sweet to funky, and everything in between. We ended up forgoing the menu and walking up to the counter to order the $20 flight of six ciders which require you to look at their draft cider menu listed on the boards behind the bar. It was fun being able to pick out what you wanted, write it on the wood holder and hand it back to a staff members to go find your ciders. They all tasted great and it was nice to try so many kinds. \n\nIn addition to cider they have beer, wine and food. We ordered the Buffalo Fries which came with hot sauce, celery, carrots, and blue cheese, and they were...weird? The fries themselves were spicy and must have been covered in some sort of spicy rub, topped with blue cheese dressing (I think) and there were small cubes of cold celery and carrots on top of that. It just didn't make sense? The pieces of cold vegetables were too small and too heavy in comparison to the fries themselves that you couldn't eat them without a fork, and we got them to share at the table. Even then, it was strange to put a bunch of cold vegetables on top of hot fries and sauce? I don't know how to explain it but we immediately wished we had ordered other fries.  \n\nThe staff themselves were all nice and helpful but because there was no table service and you had to go up to the bar to order anything.", "author": "Bri T."}

I visited the bar around 3PM on a Saturday looking for a bite to eat and a drink to start my Saturday.\n\nNot going to lie, I had a bit of sticker shock looking at the cider menu prices.  I lived in Sacramento and drank lots of Two Rivers so I felt like the price of a glass was a bit too steep considering it's shipped only 80 miles away.  I ended up getting two bottles of Sonoma Cider (the bourbon Anvil was my favorite) along with fries and a Turkish flatbread.  Unfortunately, the flatbread was pretty unflavorful and not hot.  The fries looked yummy but were not anything special.  Because the food and drinks were underwhelming and more expensive than it was worth, I don't think I'll be returning to Upcider.\n\nPROS: \n- Space is open and spacious; it's an upstairs bar so you get a nice view of the streets\n- Blueberry ketchup is unique addition to the fries\n\nCONS:\n- Ciders seemed really pricey\n- Food was also more expensive and tasted pretty bland\n\n**Tip: Google and Maps will try to send you down Hemlock St. to get to Upcider but the entrance is on Polk St.", "author": "Cimma S."}

We seated ourselves and perused the brunch menu, which was the only food menu available at the time (brunch goes until 4 pm here). \n\nI went with a french omelette ($11.95) with the additional of the housemade lamb sausage, as I was in the mood for something egg-y. It was served with your choice of house potatoes, arugula salad, or french fries. I have to admit, I had some doubts about the quality of the food here, since it's primarily a bar, but I was very pleasantly surprised by how much I found myself enjoying my omelette. The eggs were done just right where they weren't overcooked but also not runny at all. The lamb sausage was salty but given that the rest of the omelette was pretty bland, each complemented the other pretty well.\n\nParking in this area is all along the street.

Background music is not overwhelming so you can actually have conversations with your group. Good for small parties or larger ones. Lots of open space.\n\nSERVICE:\nI didn't have much expectations. When I frequent gastropub establishments, the service is usually pretty average...kind of the bare minimum chit chat to get orders and then the quick \"here's your food\" dropoff service. The staff here was above average (read: they acted like they cared about their patrons) and were pleasant to interact with.   \n\nFOOD: \nI enjoyed the mushroom flatbread (\"thin sliced pizza\"). Would get this again for sure, also a great bang for your buck. Probably the size of a medium sized thin crust pizza. The lamb slider (a bit smaller than the size of your palm) was delicious but for $7 it is pretty steep. Buffalo fries were tasty and a great side or snack item. \n\nI would recommend doing a cider flight too where you can choose 6 hard ciders (mostly from CA, OR, WA) on their rotation of close to 20. That way you can choose your own adventure and sample different ciders!\n\nIMPRESSIONS:\nUpcider is a modern and laidback establishment where you can enjoy small bites and drinks. I also dig the fact that it overlooks Polk street so you can people-watch through their full length windows and just take it in.

The days of when all I found at the stores were strongbow, stella \"cidre\" and angry orchard are over. Cider has slowly picked up and invited real cideries like Golden State, 2 Towns and See Canyon to spread their seed over the west coast. When I first found out about Upcider, navigating to it became my gold rush (because you know, most cider has a golden pour).\n\nThis bar's layout is perfect. The walk of stairs to its 2nd floor location, the dim lighting, the loud mumbling, the friendly bartenders and the view over a busy Polk street. What more could you ask for? Oh yeah cider.\n\nUpcider has a bottle menu that a newbie would be overwhelmed by. Ice cider, farmhouse cider, dry cider, semi-dry, it goes on and on. They cover their regions. The Spanish the French and the English run the euro list while the west coast runs their domestic options. \n\n+ What they have on tap might surprise you. You want Aspall on tap? and poured into an Aspall glass (which Aspall does not ship to the US), they got you covered there too. \n\nAs for the food, you cannot deny the lamb slider. Lamb and cider is a beautiful combination. \n\nMy only problem with upcider is their mark up on some of the bottles. 35-45% on most, which is unfortunate because people unfamiliar with cider may shy away from having something other than a crispin or ace just because of pricing. Although yeah I am sure that rent comes with a huge price tag for them too.\n\nUpcider is one of a kind in California. The only other cider bar in the state can be found in Long Beach (review coming soon), but it falls short. Different leagues. Upcider is my spot. Thanks to the distance, I have avoided alcoholism, but otherwise this review would probably be taken down due to conflict of interest. Don't be scared, come to Upcider, grab a menu, pull up the RateBeer app and make a decent selection.\n\nSpecific Recommendations...\n\nIf you care to know, my favorite ciders during my 3 stops here were:\n\n-Aspall Dry (on tap, its purity when compared to the bottled is obvious)\n-Shacksbury Arlo (refined farmhouse cider)\n-Sidra Bereziartua (well balanced versus other Spanish Sidra)", "author": "Javier J."}

Just think: what kind of place can you enjoy a nice social buzz while there are some families and toddlers around? Just one: Upcider.\n\nI spent an early New Year's Eve dinner out in Polk Street and found this place, and I have to say, as the \"first cider bar in America,\" this place hits all the spots for what you'd want and expect for a cider bar, and bar in general. It's got that intimate \"tasting room\" kind of vibe for aficionados, but plenty of communal sitting to enjoy REALLY good eats and chats with friends. Since it was a Saturday night on NYE, the place naturally got a little packed towards the end of the night.\n\nThis place is on the second floor (go upstairs) from street level. The food is actually DELICIOUS for a bar/gastropub. Lots of places I know don't serve good bar food, but this place had the eats that were well worth the price. I had some of the Turkish Pizza Flatbread (blend of light meats, spinach and gruyere) which was surprisingly light and easy to eat -- similar to a margherita pizza, and also their standout flatbread. I ordered an Eggplant Slider for myself which was to DIE for -- arugula, goat cheese, a hunky piece of tomato and a hefty, meaty eggplant slice (cooked through, soft and and chewy). For a slider, it was definitely satisfying and appetizing for the price! I also split the Garlic Parmesan Fries which I had no complaints about, and the Buffalo Fries which were basically soft and doused with the buffalo wing spice and peppers on top -- definitely felt the heat with it.\n\nThe cider menu definitely looked daunting, as they had lists of ciders from ALL AROUND THE WORLD (Germany, England, Spain, US?! How was I to decide?). I decided Spain was a nice, promising region to try a cider from, as their tasting notes were lighter and fruit-forward. I didn't want their super-sweet ones so I decided on the Maeloc -- a Pear Cider with slight sweetness. It hit the spot. (As for ciders in general, they can get pretty sweet and like you're drinking juice nonstop... Let it creep!).\n\nI'd definitely be back here in a heartbeat. Polk Street has a great barhopping scene and I can see why people recommend it. Nice to dine and chill with friends while taking in that sweet, San Francisco air. What's not to love? A nice ambiance, perfect for a night out.", "author": "Rachel Ann C."}

The particular bartender I had taking our order had a bad attitude and seemed bothered that I had questions about the menu and process as it was my first time there.  We had the pork and fried chicken sliders, sweet potato fries, meatballs, and shrimp.  All was just \"ok\", fried chicken was gross.  Nothing that blew us away as others have mentioned. Would not recommend for anything other than cider. Poor rating due to attitude from bartender and fried chicken sliders being cheap cuts of meat with lots of tendons that were on the verge of inedible.", "author": "Justin W."}

It's a cool spot and obviously on trend. In 2014 Cider consumption increased by 89%!! I've always liked it and ordered it occasionally but now there are real choices. I personally like the one's that are more dank, funky, have some Brett and / or yeast in them. I tried a Sheppy's, a Sonoma Cider, and get this....................... Bereziartua (a funky apple cider from Basque Country - northern Spain into the Pyranees.) Anyway - great atmosphere and a lot of great flavor profile's to check out.

I have never been to a bar that had as extensive of a beer and cider menu as UpCider has. This girl loves cider, and with a three-page menu for cider alone, I was completely overwhelmed (in the best way possible) with the choices that Upcider presented me. \n\nI was able to sample quite a few of the ciders due to coming with a large group of people who each ordered something different, and everything I tried was spectacular. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the cider options, so go ahead and be spontaneous! I am confident that whatever you pick will taste amazing. I decided to be spontaneous myself (a bit out of character for me really) and ordered the Two Rivers Huckleberry Cider, which was crisp, refreshing, and had that semi-sweet and tangy flavor characteristic of huckleberries. If you see this on the menu, I'd definitely recommend it. \n\nIn addition to the amazing beer and cider that Upcider has, I also highly recommend their caramel bread pudding. It is rich and luxurious, semi-sweet from the caramel, and a lovely warm pudding that comes with a dollop of whipped cream on top. If you're in the mood for a sweet treat as well as some cider, do not pass up the caramel bread pudding!\n\nI'm looking forward to indulging in some yummy pudding and trying out a few more ciders in Upcider the next time I find myself on a fun night out in the city!", "author": "Pooja M."}

I came with a group of friends on a casual triple date, and initially it wasn't very full. By the 8pm or 9pm mark though, things were definitely heating up, especially with the interesting beer and cider selections offered. Service is more on the casual side, and I loved the self-serve water in mason jars and barrels. Prices are a bit high for the quality of the food, but I didn't expect differently given the location and decor.\n\nSpicy lamb upslider:\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=PpvAHpTeR2aYy9jzXi5UJQ&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)\nThe lamb really came through on this upslider (such a cute name), but I didn't get too much of the spiciness.

It's a very small slider though, and it was gone in about two small bites. \n\nGarlic fries:\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=zt_53BMgi8Q77gGrKXA5zw&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)\nFrench fries:\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=bxq6jLGluuBtNlUP8x5k0A&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)\nI felt like the fries here were well-fried but underseasoned, especially the garlic fries.

The Turkish flatbread with ground lamb and beef veered slightly on the salty side, and it was a bit one-dimensional in flavor despite having good quality ingredients and being well-made. The pulled pork flatbread had a sauce that was a touch too sweet, but the fresh cilantro and red onions on top balanced it nicely. I would have loved some minced cilantro on top in addition to the sprigs, but that's just me because I think cilantro lights up almost every dish.\n\nMac and cheese:\n(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=gpabfBSi2ugaUy7jU--K3Q&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)\nI only had a bite of this dish, but it felt a little bland to me. The cheesiness fell a little short, as well as the browned crust on top that I've come to love in traditional versions of mac and cheese.

This place sounded great, and had a small tapas-style shareable menu that we could pick and choose from. \n\nThe room has a nice ambiance, with a seat yourself policy. It's wide open, with lots of seating and a nice upstairs corner view of the traffic out on Polk street. You order everything at the bar, and they will bring it out to you, so don't expect someone to come over to your table. We sat at the bar for the convenience of asking questions of the staff. \n\nI asked the bartender for a cider recommendation, and he helped me pick out a delicious mango-based cider that was sweet, but not overly so, and went down smooth. We tasted the ginger-based one, blackberry, and pumpkin as well. The ginger was very gingery (perfect if you like it), the blackberry was a little tart (if you don't want to go sweet) and the pumpkin was like drinking a carbonated pumpkin pie - like kissing your alcoholic aunt after she's had dessert!\n\nFor food, we started with the garlic fries, which had plenty of fresh garlic on them. No such thing as too much garlic for us, so we were very happy with them. We tried some of the sliders as our \"main\" - pulled pork, lamb, peppered salmon, and portobello. All of them were delicious, and perfectly sized for a bite each. \n\nWe went full balls to the wall, and finished off our meal with the mac & cheese and zucchini bites. The m&c was cheesy, bacon-y, buttery, you know, the good stuff. There was something \"off\" about the zucchini bites. Neither of us could place the flavor, but they didn't taste like the description in the menu (zucchini, feta, onions).

The fries themselves were super tasty but the blue cheese sauce on top really gave it the most delicious flavor ( my friends said that since I can't eat blue cheese) the Mac & cheese was sooooo creamy and cheeses, although the portion size seemed small, it's so heavy it's really hard to eat that much of it.  The potato pesto flatbread was very crispy and fresh.  There was a lot of flavor and texture packed into each bite. \n\nThe food here is a great greasy and tasty way to fill up before going out.

Upcider is a hard cider lover's haven, paradise, treasure...but really no matter what you decide to call it, this bar is a godsend to those who crave the particularly sweet alcoholic carbonation of a good ol' hard cider. \n\nAs an avid beer drinker, I admit that this would not be my go-to spot since the beer pickings are slim (rightfully so) and personally, some ciders can be a bit too sweet for me however, I have to say Upcider - WOW, just wow! The variety you have to choose from is pretty top notch. I'm talking, they have a cider (or did during my visit) that was nearly $32/pint! \n\nFYI, they do have other alcohol for sale such as beer but the pickings are slim. \n\nI really love the ambiance of the place and it would be a great spot to hangout in with a group or just a few friends as well. \n\nI will note that Upcider does have a kitchen, but alas I was unable to try their offerings since the kitchen was closed.

I got a light ballast point sculpin, which was unfortunately from the can. I should have looked closer at their tap menu, darn! Next time :) The bartender pouring my beer was efficient and smiley, but nothing too drastic of service. They still had some people having light dinner when we came around 9:30PM on a Thursday evening, but most people were having beers and enjoying their company.\n\nI loved that upcider's sign was on their second-story corner because it's so easy for me to describe to your friends who don't think they can find upcider. Just tell them to look up, and the sign will be extremely obvious. Street parking was super great because there were so many spots on the street (metered, but free after 6PM YAY!). The ambiance is what I loved the most. There are so many bar stools that wrap around the edge of the space, which is perfect for people-watching and in our case, watching the line to Social Hall.

Note when you enter, you must go upstairs to get to get to the actual restaurant/bar.  Also note, even though there are tables or low tops -- you order from the bar.  Also, if you aren't really paying that much attention when you pick the place (like me) -- this is a place that specializes in Ciders (thus the name), so there are a lot of Cider choices, and not many other options.  \n\nI liked the atmosphere/decor of this place -- the windows are large and let in a lot of natural light, and you're able to look down on Polk street, which is pretty nice.  There are also cute hanging lights, which really give it a trendy/fun/cute vibe.  \n\nWe ordered the Cajun Chicken Slider, Peppered Salmon Slider, Turkish Flatbread, and Sweet Potato Fries.  My friend and I both agreed that the best part of the sliders was the bread/roll (really buttery and perfectly toasted).  I thought the chicken was dry and didn't really eat too much of it -- although my friend did.  The salmon slider was really peppery but didn't really have enough salt -- but it was cooked perfectly.  We were disappointed by the Turkish Flatbread -- mostly because it didn't have cheese (lol). Honestly, it tasted great, but we just really wanted the cheese too.  Our favorite part were the Sweet Potato fries -- MUST TRY.  They were so good and the house-made blueberry ketchup is amazing.  We were totally blown away.\n\nOverall -- definitely a great spot to meet up/hangout.  I would recommend, and would go back again.", "author": "Michelle S."}

Tried their passionfruit cider and Ace cider. Passionfruit cider was a recommendation from bartender and it was too sweet for my taste but Ace cider was pretty awesome. We ended up ordering garlic fries and sweet potato fries with blueberry ketchup. I was really hoping to like blueberry ketchup after reading other yelp reviews but it was not for me. Loved their garlic fries though! Also, ordered potato flatbread and it was yummy. We really wanted to try their caramel bread pudding but they sold the last one and told us that we will have to wait another 40 mins for it so we skipped it. \n\nThe best thing was the ambiance of this place. I am not a big cider fan but it was very chill place to come with friends and hang out. I would definitely recommend this place! :)", "author": "Shirali A."}

The interior has a great atmosphere with dimmed lights and hardwood walls. It feels like a cross between a sleek lounge and an old fashioned saloon.\n\nAs the name implies, Upcider focuses on all types of hard ciders. The sheer amount of options are almost overwhelming. There are literally four pages of cider options from numerous breweries. All total there are well over a hundred choices to decide between. There are varying sizes, alcohol content and flavors, some come in cans, some in bottles. Not really knowing too much about cider, I lucked out when I chose a tasty apple ginger flavor called Dragon's Breath. After that I got a pumpkin flavored cider which was light and delicious.\n\nThe food was not all that great. We had a few flatbreads which were average and some sort of potato dish which was good but nothing special.

This was my number one choice because it just sounds so unique. Well, it was and it was BOMB. Has a nice crisp sweet to it, that's what I look for the crispy and the sweet. Pleasant sweet notes of the nectar is tasted but nothing powerful. Good choice, the bottle is equivalent to two glasses.\n\nSIR PERRY BERRY(~$9) - William's from Bistol, England. 17oz with 6% alcohol. This was pretty good, similar to the blossom nectar but not as crisp yet has some light notes of strawberry and berry. Kind of reminds me of a \"diet\" strawberry soda.\n\nJOKER DRY (~$8) - Ace Cider from Sebastopol, CA. 12oz with 6.9% alcohol. Took a sip of this and it was dry. I can't remember much about this one. LOL. sorry.\n\nSTUFFED POTATO SOUFFLE ($8.95) - house-made ground sausage*, mashed potato was their basic description. My description, fancy ass mash potatoes with a fluffy whip to it. DAMN THIS WAS GOOD. \n\nCALAMARI WITH PRESERVED LEMONS ($8.95) - description says 'green onions and jalapenos', I didn't really get any of those flavors. I did enjoy that it had the light batter and it was crispy but I've had way better and have had way worst. It was fair and managable to eat. But why did I really have alot of tentacles (i hate tentacles).\n \nSWEET POTATO FRIES ($5.95) - served with house-made blueberry ketchup. Sweet potato fries were good and the blueberry ketchup was interesting. It looked really dark but it had some hints of blueberry. Not sweet, more tangy. It wasn't so bad at all!\n\nSPINACH AND GRUYERE ($9.95) - spinach, garlic, gruy\u00e8re. We saw another table have this and although we were pretty stuffed, had to get it because it looked really inviting. VERY THIN FLATBREAD, those are the best. The crust was so thin and crunchy, loved it. I liked how they cooked the pizza, melted the gruy\u00e8re and then added the spinach last. \n\nWill I be back? YES INDEEDEE!!!!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-02-22", "description": "Is it Upcider or should it really be called Outcider or worse yet, Downcider? It probably depends on how thirsty you are and whether you have plans to dine elsewhere. On Valentine's Day, I had the implausible notion that this would be a casual, low-key place for me and Jamie W. to eat and have some cider. The cider part was decent enough albeit nothing that came fresh from a tap. It was also nice to view the hubbub of Polk Street from a cavernous second-floor space away from the glare of vagrants and perpetual gawkers. But the food was marginal at best, ill-conceived at its worst and not worth repeating until they decide to place greater focus on their food menu.\n\nJamie and I were the only ones seated at a table for quite a while. In fact, it was a bit of a challenge to get the attention of the waiter who appeared to be doubling as a second bartender. After studying the extensive cider menu, we let him recommend our libations for us. Jamie ended up getting a $7 bottle of the German-fermented Possman Pure Apple Cider, a sweet, tingly refresher of a drink that was quite perfect for a briskly chilled evening (see photo). I ordered the $5 bottle of Ace Pear Hard Cider, which was more sweeter despite an infusion of apple cider and quite refreshing to boot (see photo). It was a tad too bitter for my taste, but I was encouraged by this start. Upcider indeed.\n\nBut Downgrub it was. The chief disaster came in the form of the $6.95 Buffalo Fries, which believe it or not, came out ice-cold with a heavy ladle of blue cheese mixed with chopped carrots and celery and doused with hot sauce (see photo). We had them sent back to the kitchen for repairs only to find the fries still lukewarm on their return visit to our table. Another disappointment was the $10.95 Turkish Flatbread, which bore little resemblance to the roadside pizza I had on the Turquoise Coast of Turkey. Though there were claims of chopped lamb and beef, we barely noticed any on it, just a light tomato paste, a lot of cilantro and chopped peppers (see photo). We were audibly sighing from indifference at this point.\n\nThings picked up with the $8.95 Kale Caesar Salad, and even though kale is far more fibrous than romaine, the switch worked simply because there was ample dressing on every single leaf, and it was tossed generously with parmesan-encrusted croutons (see photo). Jamie's favorite small plate, however, was the $9.95 Garlic Shrimp which came blackened and heavily sauced in a Creole-style cream with toasted baguette slices (see photo). I liked them, too, but the sauce was a bit too overwhelming for my taste. The waiter was pleased we finished our plates and even comped us for the chilly Buffalo Fries, but that wasn't enough for us to change our mind. We may be back but only for the cider and the streetside view.\n\nFOOD - 2 stars...disappointing small plates of food treated as afterthoughts...\nCIDER - 4 stars...but the cider's good on its own\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...heavy on the black but quite spacious even as it crowds up\nSERVICE - 3 stars...a slow start and multi-tasking too much but ultimately quite nice\nTOTAL - 3 stars...a upcider/downgrub combo", "author": "Ed U."}

I need to take my cider loving roommate here...\n\nAnd for those who don't particularly like cider, like me, not to fear! They have plenty of other yummy things to drink. I was feeling like a stout, so I went with Old Rasputin from North Coast, definitely a fave of mine so I was quite pleased when I saw it on the menu. Beer menu is also fairly extensive so good choices for everyone!\n\nFinally, the food here is way better than your typical bar snacks. I had a delicious slider and shared a Turkish flatbread, which was essentially cheese-less pizza (sounds weird but it was super tasty) with a friend. There were lots of other tasty sounding options as well.

This one was spicy and messy.  I didn't really enjoy the taste of the meat either.  It looked like a sloppy joe flatbread so that was already a turn off.\n-Calamari - This could have used more flavor and the sauce it came with didn't really complement it well.\n-Fried zucchini cakes? - Just didnt wow me too much either.  \n\nAll of us bought one drink, and the total came out to be pretty much $50/person.

Tried the lamb one too and though it was really delicious, it had nothing on the salmon one! \n\nDry joker (cider): If you're not into super sweet drinks, this is a good choice! It's still cider so it was still sweet, but it wasn't too much so that was good. There was also a ginger cider that my friend got but it had kind of a weird aftertaste so I'm really glad I went with this one.\n\nRaspberry kombucha beer: This was amazing! Sweeter than the cider, but it was really unique tasting- kind of a mix between moscato and beer. I finally understood what hops are from this drink! Also, it's pink so you can't really go wrong. \n\nGot some caramel bread pudding to end dinner.

I definitely got a lesson in ciders, as there were so many, and we were able to try a whole bunch.  There were 4 of us, so I had the opportunity to sample tons of ciders.  There were typical sweet, crispy ones, and ones that tasted more like champagne or wine, others that were super dry, and still others that were just...\"interesting.\"  I think I still like the sweet, crisp ones the best, but I'm glad I got to try all the other varieties.  If you're into ciders and want to sample what the apple has to offer, I'd definitely recommend this place.\n\nIn addition, we got some food, which was all quite tasty.  Tried two sliders - a cajun chicken one and the salmon one - both were pretty good.  Also tried the spinach gruyere flatbread, which I also enjoyed.  The sweet potato fries come with this interesting blueberry ketchup.  It was alright.  \n\nAlso, the place wasn't super crowded on a Saturday night, and there were plenty tables for us to sit comfortably and chat.  It's not like a typical SF bar on a Saturday night where you can barely hear each other and have to weave your way through a crowd.  This place is full, but not crowded, which lends to a much more enjoyable experience.\n\nI should caution, however, that if you decide to spend your entire night here sampling ciders, it will get expensive very quickly.  The cheapest ciders are around $5.  And then there are ciders that are about the size of wine bottles for several times that.  I don't think they had anything on tap, so you're getting a bottle each time you order a new cider.  So yeah, watch your wallet.  Or at least come with a bigger group so you can try each other's drinks without having to order a ton of different ones yourself.", "author": "Vivian C."}

Because I am not a big cider fan.\n\nCider for me was what kids growing up drank when they didn't like beer.  It wasn't quite on par with teenage girls drinking wine coolers but for me, they were in the same ballpark.  Visiting places like the UK have edified me otherwise but I am far from a connoisseur of cider, I just acknowledge that it's something beyond a beer alternative.  So if you like cider, this is your mecca.  I didn't know there were this may ciders available for consumption in the US, much less anywhere. So yeah, cider, have at it.\n\nMy review is based on the food which is primarily why I was there (and that my friend selected the place).  We had the creole shrimp which tasted amazing, incredibly savory blend of hearty spices.  It tasted very much like my favorite dish from Town Hall, the barbecue gulf shrimp, similar in both flavor and complexity.  I basically ate the sauce with a spoon.  No, seriously, I asked for a spoon.  \n\nAlso had the mushroom medley which was mushrooms heaped on top of thin toast and dripping with warm gorgonzola.  It was incredible as well, decadent blend of flavors. \n\nMy only regret was that the portions weren't huge to share and I was still hungry when I left.

Right on Polk next to Vertigo, and huge windows framed with twinkly lights.\n\nI thought the place was closed because it's in an upstairs locale, but I found my way into the clean, modern restaurant. I arrived early and ordered the Julian Black and Blue cider, per the server's recommendation. It was tart, sweet, lightly bubbly, served in a redwine glass, would abso-fruitly get again. When my friends arrived we ordered a few appetizers to go with our cider. \n\nBuffalo Fries: spicy! I love spicy food, so that was great for me, and my girls liked the heat, too. They are drizzled with blue cheese dressing and chopped carrots and celery so you get a nice little crunch. They cool off fast, so eat up, Buttercups! My favorite dish we got, and to think I wanted regular old garlic fries!\n\nBacon Mac n' Cheese: hot, cheesy, salty, with baked breadcrumbs on top. Too many green onions for my taste, but still good.\n\nCreole Shrimp: nothing to really write home about, I probably would skip this next time and get a flatbread. It was just over cooked shrimp in a thick, creamy red sauce. But you can't win 'em all, kids.\n\nI got the Aspall English Demi-Sec as my final cider which was sweeter and less tart, very good, both of my friends liked it better than their ciders.

We did have what appeared to be the most adventorous flatbread (Turkish) - which was good - but it wasn't nearly as flavorfull as expected. \n\nThe housemade blueberry ketchup, served with the sweet potato fries was nice. It did, however, taste how it sounds... and not in a bad way.\n\nThis is a good spot. Maybe if I was a cider lover I would learn more towards the four stars versus three.", "author": "John F."}

It's organized by country of origin, and yes, they carry hard cider from almost anywhere. I think on the four page list stuck on the clipboard, I saw France, Germany, New Zealand, the list goes on..\nUnless you're a hard cider tank and you are willing to spend anywhere from $7 - $30 each time for a new glass of hard cider, I'd recommend getting the flight that's written on the chalkboard. $15 for 5 small glasses of hard cider they're currently featuring? I consider that a pretty sweet deal. My friend got it and even though she didn't like one or two of them hard ciders so much as the others, she did think it was worth it. I personally got the black berry currant cider which tasted more like girly wine, more to my liking.\n\nTheir food was pretty good, but don't expect cheap gastropub food. While I'd say the food was done well, UpCider as a whole has you feeling slightly ripped off at the end of a long workday.  Also, I'm not really a fan of how you have to go up to the bar to order, than walk around looking for the water serving station(IT'S SO DARK IN THERE, HOW COULD I HAVE FOUND IT?!) and then you see the employees frantically and hopelessly swim in the room of people looking for the appropriate person to give their plate to.\n\n4/5 for their ciders, but minus 1 star for their prices.", "author": "Zoe H."}

You'll likely be confused by all the choices but it is fun to talk to the servers about what they think of the options. The servers are very friendly and helpful - highly recommend talking to them! \n\nThe standouts were: \n- the pulled pork slider with peach bbq sauce (we inhaled this one)\n- the mushroom slider with caramelized onions\n- the Angry Orchard ginger apple cider\n- the sweet potato fries with blueberry ketchup (sounds weird but totally delicious)\n\nThe Turkish flatbread was good, but not as amazing as the stuff we had above. Next time I come here, I will just order more sliders instead of the flatbread. I also ordered the North American black currant cider bc I like the taste of black currant candy - but it ended up tasting like a strange combo of wine and apple juice. \n\nService was excellent - the cider and food came out quickly and the signout process was very fast with the iPad.

The food portions are just right and enough to share with a table of friends (I recommend the mac & cheese if it's available on the special menu or the Cajun shrimp from the regular menu).\n\nI always appreciate a place that doesn't try too hard. Upcider's ambiance is relaxed enough to have a drink with a few friends and catch up, but also intimate enough to bring a date and converse while sitting by the large windows and people-watching the Polk Street bar crawl crowd.\n\nThe reason this isn't a five star rating is that the food overall is a little underwhelming. Though the mac & cheese and Cajun shrimp are delicious, the flatbreads and the sliders fall short.

Nice big windows that overlook the busy life of Polk street. We arived around 6:30. I'm not sure if all the tables were reserved but it was pretty empty. We did make reservations for that time just in case. You could also sit at the bar and a bar table by the windows. By the time we left the place was super packed.\n\nI had seen that some Yelpers had cider flights and was excited to try several to taste. Unfortunately they don't have flights! I had done some research on best ciders so I started out with Tieton Cherry.. which was very good, sweet and perfect for my taste. My partner had the Ace blackberry which was ok. We also ordered the Turkish flatbread which was yum and perfect together with the ciders. Also ordered the mac n cheese with bacon (good), grilled portobello slider (super yum), peppered salmon slider (again, super yum), and the meatballs (good). Oh and bread pudding for dessert (yummay). We ordered a couple of other ciders: since I liked the Tieton, ordered the spicy pumpkin from them.. it is autumn! And Crispin The Saint. Both were good. \n\nOur tab was $100 so yes can get pricey.

While I have some sympathy in that regard, the quality of service was by far the worst I've experienced in a very long time. The waiters and waitresses were really all over the place and hard to flag down. At one point, a waitress turned and walked away mid-conversation...it was pretty unbelievable.\n\nWhat's weird is the waiters were pretty good about clearing empty glasses and plates from our table but slower than a DMV line to take orders and bring out food.\n\nWhat keeps this review at 3-stars is the pure cider and the pulled-pork sliders I ordered. The cider was crisp, refreshing and sweet, and I loved the cilantro in the mini sliders. There was another shrimp dish I ordered that was beyond bland and so not worth the $12 it's priced at.\n\nI most likely won't be coming back. But if you go, try a cider and the pulled pork sandwich.", "author": "Kat C."}

FOUR pages. I was very excited about that. I had the California Mighty Dry. So refreshing and crisp. The menu is amazing too... Lamb sliders, spinach-Gruyere flatbread, and roasted beet salad are a few items that stick out. I got the meatballs. Sauce was savory, meatballs perfectly spiced. Servings are tapas style, 4 meatballs. Perfect for a snack before a show or movie.", "author": "Jenn S."}

To actually get to this place you have to look up because it is on the second floor but don't let this stop you at all. Once you see the sign getting there is easy. Walked to be greeted by friendly staff which gave us the option to sit anywhere so we opted for the bar even thou the window tables are a great spot too. As we sat to look at the menu we where amazed by the amount of ciders they had! As I am a big cider fan I was stoked! We decided to do a tasting, which was on the board above the bar. This was a great choice to sample a few ciders I had not had before. I did get a slider which was great.

Wanna fight about it?\n\nCider is serious stuff: It has been a popular alcoholic beverage about as long as beer or wine, Johnny Appleseed reportedly planted apple trees so that people could enjoy cider, and our social and moral superiors (ha!), the English, the French and the Spanish each make distinct styles of it.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, Upcider is the only restaurant/bar in or around town that offers more than two ciders, let alone an entire a menu of them. The ciders vary in style and flavor profile, ranging from the ubiquitous Wyders to a couple of Basque ciders (which have that sour-sweet-funk of sour beers).  The beer list features several microbrews and there is wine as well.\n\nThere's good food too, which ranges from normal bar snacks such as fries to some more interesting stuff for a bar like a kale Caesar salad, \"Buffalo\" fries (which are tossed in hot sauce with blue cheese and celery/carrots), various (non-hamburger) sliders and some nice pizza-like flatbreads. I also get the impression that the menu changes a bit to reflect what's seasonal and good in the markets.\n\nIt's upstairs in the old Ozone Thai space, enter to the left of Vertigo.", "author": "Suo L."}

I was super impressed with how friendly and accommodating they were.\n\nAs for the cider, they have probably 35-40 ciders on hand, ranging from $5 a bottle to more than $20. I had a pear cider and really enjoyed it. The food was fantastic, too! We tried everything on the menu, from the sliders to flat breads to salads and entrees.

It's actually nice to feel a little more active in these settings rather than staying sat down the whole time, waiting to stuff my face.\n\nWhile the grand list of cider drinks was very tempting, I had on a different taste palette that night. I ordered a Kombucha Raspberry beer, because I wanted something on the sour side. It was BOMB, just what I needed, and my table loved the taste too, along with the drinks they ordered. \n\nWe ordered all the different sliders, but much to my dismay, they were all out of slider buns for the night! But they recovered by substituting lettuce wraps.

It is a cider bar (whaaaattttt!!)  with amazing food.  Since cider is kind of a new culture here, and hard to find good kinds in stores, this place is heaven!  We tried bunch of different ones after getting great recommendations from our server & owner.  I had no idea how much ciders vary..  They have ciders from US, England, Spain, Scotland, Germany, Ireland  .. and they are looking to bring more and more, that's very exciting!  There is a cider for everyone here: from very dry to sweet organic ones ( Scrumpy is my new favorite as a sweet treat).  \nAlcohol content is surprisingly high in many ciders: it is kind of surprising to feel a nice kick after drinking apple cider at the end..  Wandering Aengus and Crispin were our favorites.\n\nThe food was way beyond expectations!  The chef is amazing and every dish we tried was very tasty.  We try to order different dishes every time, and I guess we tried every slider couple times ( upsliders :)) , my favorites are cajun chicken and lamb sliders.  My vegetarian friend has to have the portabella mushroom  slider every time we go now..\nFlatbreads and salad are great, too! I love the potato pesto flat bread and turkish flat bread if you are a meat lover like me!  Kale Caesar Salad is a great alternative to regular Caesar.\n\nService has been great every time we have been there. Staff are very welcoming and attentive at all times.  Seems like it is getting busier every week.  We love the simple yet modern & neat style of the place.  It has a very open feel.

Food- we ordered flatbread with spinach and Gruyere (his suggestion, said it was better than the potato and pesto) and we definitely enjoyed it! Potato souffl\u00e9 was very fun to eat but I felt like it was less worthwhile for the price. Ambience is great, softly lit with a lot of natural outside light and the window seats are great for people watching. Definitely a good place for smaller/ quieter groups since the space is so large, went on a Sunday so not sure how crowded it ends up being on weekends, especially since it's a block away from rowdier bars on Polk. \nGot a Ace pineapple cider, a Sonoma pear cider, and BF got a dryer apple cider on tap.

I had looked all over for Upcider until I finally looked up and saw the sign. Then I had to find the entrance which was just as confusing as its above a Subway but it is definitely worth the scavenger hunt it takes to get there.\n\nLove the ambiance set up by the upstairs location. You have to go up some stairs that sprawls out into a simple bar layout that works so well for this small location. There are plenty of tables set up for group events or dinner dates. And much like Fly Bar next door they actually have enough food on the menu to warrant making this a dinner option as opposed to just grabbing drinks. \n\nThis has to be my favorite date spot in the city. Its not too expensive and it has the novelty of being a cider bar. I have never encountered one of these before and with cider being my favorite kind of drink needless to say I was in heaven. Just the sheer amount of Cider options will overwhelm you if you are not a pro. There are at least 8 pages of ciders from every country that produces quality cider. So many imports to please even the most picky of cider fans. If you aren't sure where to start and have no idea about crispness, bitterness or sweetness the bartenders will willingly help you make a selection. \n\nThey are so good at their jobs I am always afraid my dates are going to leave me for them after a couple minutes of chatting with them. They always make quality selections and keep the night going. \n\nWhether sitting at the bar or at the tables or along the window there is plenty of room and it never gets too crowded during the weekdays. Be forewarned they are closed on Mondays. Also no need to get dressed up but I would recommend business casual. No one just rolls in off the street or out of bed.\n\nThe food is fantastic as well. I would recommend the flatbreads, the garlic friends and the ceasar kale salad. Its the perfect complimentatry food for ciders light and tasty. I have tried several of the dishes there and nothing has really disappointed. You can eat as little or as much as you want so head there anytime after work. \n\nYou really can't beat this location if you are looking for an alternative to the wine and beer of most bars.

Try your chances if you're wandering past and looking for a bite (and sip, of course)! \n\nThe setup of this place makes it easy for groups that hate trying to split checks. You'll get a clipboard with their portfolio-looking menu, then go up to the bar to order individually. Cards accepted! Servers were nice and easygoing, but we did have to ask for water from the bar.\n\nWhat Upcider had in store for us:\n- Stuffed Potato Souffle: salty, dense, and delicious. It's meat and potatoes, v2.0. Surprisingly filling. \n- Pulled Pork Flatbread: flatbreads are the most bang for your buck on the menu, and perfect for sharing. I love pork with pretty much anything, so this was a smoky, BBQ-ed winner in my book. \n- Turkish Flatbread: I am not a fan of lamb, so far with anything. But I can see why the subtle heat in this flatbread could appeal.\n- Creole Shrimp: we had a good laugh over the three pieces of bread and five jumbo shrimp in this dish. The sauce WAS good though and is perfect for dipping when you want some Cajun spice on your flatbread. \n- Fries: we sampled all three - Buffalo, Sweet Potato, and Garlic. Get Buffalo if you love  your fries messy and saucy. The Sweet Potato actually was not that sweet, but the blueberry sauce gave it a little extra flavor boost. The Garlic advertises itself - I swear you can smell the distinctive fragrance from across the room. \n\nDrinks? I thought you'd never ask.\n- Ace Pumpkin Cider: one of their seasonal specials. It smells like cinnamon, but tastes tangy and light.\n- Possman Pure Cider: if you're not a cider person,  you'll become one after trying this. It's smooth and complex, leaving a very pleasant aftertaste. \n- Sonoma Pear Cider (The Pitchfork): tastes like juice, with a creamy/buttery tail! How did they do that?\n- Sonoma Bourbon Cider (The Anvil): well, it's bourbon. I don't appreciate it enough to comment... \n... And so many more! There's a cider literally for everyone and then some. \n\nWith all these drinks, you'll be expecting a trip to the bathroom. Cartoons of a potty dancing man and woman identify your destination in a corner. There's a sink outside both, which leads me to wonder if the men's room doesn't have one inside? The women's is lit in pink by an overhead light and decorated with a single comic-book style drawing. Can you keep a secret? it asks.", "author": "Helen S."}

Flat breads to die for! LOL ok maybe not die, but they are pretty darn delicious. \n\nThey close at midnight so get here early and enjoy the intimate atmosphere.", "author": "Krystle L."}

Got some sliders which were good and the spinach and gruyere flatbread which 1/2 of was delicious, the other half was burnt. No one ever refilled our water glasses and getting the bill was just as painful as our initial greeting. Asked 3 different people before it finally happened.

Upcider offers an encyclopedic list of cider options from all over the world. How do you like them apples? :)\n\nWe ordered the Finn River Forest Ginger, Thistly Cross Whiskey Cask, and Two Rivers Cider Co. Blood Orange ciders.\n\nThe Finn River Forest Ginger was our favorite. It's better than Angry Orchard's ginger variety. We guzzled it!\n\nThe Thistly Cross Whiskey Cask was great as well. Not extremely 'sparkling' but it offered a round, oaky flavor.\n\nThe Blood Orange was probably our least favorite but had an interesting taste evolution. When the bottle was first opened, it was extremely carbonated, so much that the flavor was masked; fizzy but flavorless. But after sitting for 30 minutes or so, another sip provided delicate citrus notes. Wish this one had been a little more flavorful.\n\nWhile the cider selection is clearly top-notch, the menu needs some work. First of all, it seems like it's suffering from a bit of an identity crisis. Middle Eastern-inspired dishes and Buffalo fries? With cider? The offerings sound good by themselves but are a little strange in the cider house context. \n\nAlso, such a place could be a drinking AND EATING haven for gluten-free individuals. With a gluten-free member in our group, we came here because we assumed an SF cider house would be gluten-free friendly. However, their food menu's gluten-free offerings were scarce. What a missed opportunity with such a large gluten-free community in the Bay Area! Our gluten intolerant member of the group ordered a slider, gluten-free style. It came sans bun and wrapped in raw cabbage...which added an unsavory bitter flavor. \n\nWe also ordered a round of fries - both buffalo and sweet potato. I thought they were both delicious. I especially liked the blueberry ketchup for the sweet potato fries. The clove spicing was unexpected and brilliant.\n\nSome gluten-eaters of the group also ordered sliders. The upsliders (with buns) were tasty but on the skimpy side for the price ($6-7 for a hockey puck-sized slider). These were the most disappointing items of the night. Would not get these again unless the portion size were to increase.\n\nI would definitely come again but stick to what I know I like...cider and sweet potato fries!\n\nFinally, if you're coming on a busy night and want to grab a table, make sure you do so away from the bar area. We made the mistake of choosing a table by the bar, and there was a lot of 'hovering'. Not my favorite!", "author": "Lissy R."}

I thought the flavor was great and I loved the sweet and soft hawaiian style bun and the creamy aioli. \n\nTurkish Flatbread ($10.95) - This doesn't look or taste like your average pizza. There is no cheese. The crust is very thin and crispy, and not doughy at all. I liked the flavor on this - spicy sausage and lots of tomatoes. This was a good dish to share as it came with 8 or 10 slices.\n\nMeatballs ($9.95) - Oh man. I really liked the spicy tomato sauce on this dish. And it tasted so good on the crunchy bread that they serve with it. I liked the sauce so much that I forgot whether or not I liked the meatballs themselves haha. I think they were good though. I remember liking this dish overall :).\n\nMac n Cheese ($7?) - This was a special for the night. I loved the crispy crunchy golden brown bread crumbs on top.

It was good, but I am just not sure if it was worth the $14 price tag that I paid for it.

There were so many choices and the server was fantastic in helping us pick the flavors we were looking for. I personally tried the Blackberry Pear and it was delish!

If you aren't a big fan of cider, wine and beer are also options. \n\nAs for food, we got the buffalo fries, potato and pesto flatbread, salmon upslider and the calamari. My favorite was the flatbread. It paired so well with the cider! The other dishes were  also interestingly good.\n\nI even enjoy the pay method, in which they use a square reader with an iPad and stand.

Once I caught wind that there was a cider bar (beer and wine also served) in the city I had to go immediately, all other matters became secondary. \n\nUpcider is located on Polk, cross street Sutter, sharing a wall with Vertigo. I mention this because, if you been to this area you know that on most nights of the week, you that it is shit show for various reasons that need not be explained at this time. However, since it is on the second floor, you feel like you've momentarily escaped the debauchery. The space is open and inviting, \n\nThe staff was very friendly, attentive, and knowledgable. After taking some time to scroll through the three pages of domestic and international ciders (it may take several incarnation for me to try them all), I ordered Angry Orchard traditional by way of Cincinnati, Ohio (had to support Ohio, since I was born in Cleveland) and ordered garlic fries. This dry, crisp cider in combination with their garlic fries made my day. Ah...simple  pleasures. Only complaint is that the garlic fries are thin cut fries, not my thing. \n\nUpcider I will see you soon!", "author": "Brian S."}

I hope it won't continue to be an 'only possible in San Francsico' idea.\n\nUpcider gives you the chance to experience the full range of alcoholic ciders out there , and I had no idea how much variety there was - or how high quality it could get. We tried ciders from beer-bottle grade brands like Sonoma Ciderworks (not quite as good) and Anthem (very bright, well carbonated - would pound) that were definitely interesting alternatives to a beer. It got MUCH more interesting though when we explored the higher end of the cider list with Wandering Aengus and Devoto, which literally came out of a wine bottle and was served on stems. Really tasty stuff.\n\nThe food's decent - very comfort focused, but that's not why you'd go. We enjoyed enough baked mac and cheese, buffalo-style fries and meatballs to stay ahead of all the cider we were downing. It all tasted great and offered a definitively classy (while equally heavy) alternative to your typical wings/cheese fries at \"the bar\", and keeps the focus on the drinks you're there for.\n\nThe owner came to our table and chatted with us at one point - he was really engaging and friendly discussing the emerging cider industry and making recommendations for cider 'beginners' without pushing us around at all.\n\nThe whole experience here had a really personal feel to it - like we were invited to check out this thing our friend is really into over great food and conversation. Great time. There's also a vibe of wanting to focus on regional brands and local artists that was cool.

While some may find the space a bit too simple I have never been one to worry about decor, especially when the food and drink are on point.  \n\nIn my mind hard cider has always been an adult beverage offered as an alternative to beer for women in general or  the upstart young cosmopolitan male.   However, after suddenly acquiring an allergy to hops some years back I have been forced to expand my libation horizons in order to imbibe when a gallon of tequila is not available. The impressive  list of ciders from around the world made finding an ideal pick  essentially a lottery as I have little knowledge of this brave new world.  \n\nThe staff is courteous and knowledgeable, the food is filling yet far from overbearing, the space is simple yet the room is filled.

I am forever disappointed when I go to bars and ask if they have cider only to be scoffed at, or have only one option to choose from. Upcider's two glorious pages of cider choices were beautiful to behold, and ALL of the 10-12 varieties our group chose were delicious. Most of the ciders came in 22 ounce bottles, so you may want to bring a friend to share with if you there are a few you want to try.\n\nAs far as food goes, it was nothing to write home about, but it was nice to have some options to nosh on whilst imbibing. We had the meatballs (okay, but overpriced at about $10 for three golfball-sized pieces) and the potato and pesto flatbread, which was pretty much just a large cracker with potato slices, but wasn't bad. We came looking for a light dinner with our drinks, and I think in the future I'll be eating elsewhere beforehand.\n\nGreat atmosphere. It's on the corner of Polk and Sutter up on the second floor, so you get a great view of the nightlife. We went on a Saturday night, and there was plenty of room for our group of seven. Loud enough that you could hear the music and not feel bad about some enthusiastic conversation, but quiet enough that you could actually carry out said conversation. Nice musical mix- any place that plays Elliott Smith and Queens of the Stone age has my support. \n\nDefinitely planning on coming back again- way too many ciders I still haven't tried.", "author": "Lacy M."}

They have enough wait staff that they could just take your  order and know your table.

We came with a group of 6 and ordered a number of drinks and menu items. Some to share and some to consume exclusively.\n\nThe sliders were expensive, but good from what people said. We ordered every french fry combination and enjoyed them all. I liked the meatballs quite a bit too. \n\nThe music was a little louder than it needed to be for the number of people in the bar and it was hard to hear each other. I couldn't tell if they wanted the feeling to be restaurant like, bar like, or lounge like. Given it was a room with tables and seats I would have thought the focus would be on good food, good cider, and great conversation. Unfortunately this was not possible in our group and it was even hard to talk to the people next to you.\n\nI would consider going back, but not sure if I would pay a premium for the ciders versus buying them from whole foods or another specialty shop and drinking at home.", "author": "Chris I."}

A group of us gathered a month after a friend's birthday for a surprise party and we thought we'd be kind and accommodate her gluten-free diet by going to \"the new all cider\" spot in town. They kindly took group reservations and was patient enough to explain the menu to each of us as we trickled in. They even offered to put the Mission Pie we brought into the fridge and gave us extra room for the balloons. After 25 minutes of nursing our ciders we got a call from the friend that was supposed to get the birthday girl to Upcider saying that the birthday girl really wanted to ditch her diet for the night and eat a Nick's taco...\n\nAwkward. We explained it to our server and they quickly wrapped up our tab, returned our pie (reluctantly haha), and let us on our merry way. I really appreciated their flexibility but also felt really bad because we were the only people in the place. Maybe things have changed now but for that reason alone - I can only give it 3 stars.

It looked trendy- lots of vintage wood and chalkboards. But honestly, it was a little creepy. It was very empty and some of the characters there seemed like they were out of a mob movie. \n\nThe food here was mediocre hipster fare. Arugula salad was great, but not amazing and the flat bread was probably the highlight. The buffalo fries were... meh. More weird than intriguing. \n\nThe most disappointing part of this establishment was that although its collection of worldwide ciders was intriguing and interesting, THEY HAD NO BEER OR CIDER ON TAP. As a beer snob, this loses major points. A great beer or cider can be experienced the best fresh from the tap, not bottled. At least offer a few beers and ciders on tap!\n\nOverall, I'm really not sure if the food or cider is the highest priority here rather than the cool trendy hipster looks.", "author": "Daniel L."}

Upcider met them! The 3 page cider list was impressive, and the food was deeeeelicious. At first, the bread-heavy menu was disheartening for a glutard like me, but the waiter was very helpful in finding me enough gluten-free options that I came away stuffed and happy. We had the pulled pork slider with a cabbage wrap instead of a bun, which i think was better than a breaded exterior could have been - you get this high-test, slightly cool crunch with a hot, juicy pork center. Mmmmmmm. . .  Also a very good arugula salad, light and crispy calamari (dredged in rice flour instead of wheat, which give you a more delicate, crispy crust), peppered salmon slider, and the meatballs, which were pleasantly savory and smoky. I had a strong hankering for a tart cherry cider and went over all the options with our waiter, but they didn't have any in the smaller bottles. He went away and then returned to tell me that they 'happened to have' an open bottle in the back, however, and my wish was granted. Very cool. The ciders are mostly in bottles, but discussion with our very helpful ciderier revealed that bottles preserve the really good stuff in a way serving it on tap cannot replicate. that said, they will be getting some taps for some of the more robust ciders in the future. And they serve my favorite french cider - Eric Bordelet, which is like the champagne of ciders it is so good. \nWe will be back!", "author": "Jordan J."}

The selection of ciders is expansive and the menu of food is good for tapas-style bites and small plates. I had the kale caesar salad and cajun shrimp, and a bite of a slider and I would easily recommend all of them. Atmosphere is rustic and nice and it's fairly quiet.\n\nHere's the thing: for a bar, it shouldn't take so long to get a bottle of cider...it's not like they're specialty cocktails. While the service was slow and he couldn't keep up with food and drink orders for our table (granted, a dozen or so people), the food and drinks--when they came and were the correct orders--were very good.\n\nCheapest cider is $5 for a bottle but some of the expensive ones get into the $20+ range.

Lots of local varieties, plus some from around the world, the drink list had 50+ different kinds you can order from a pretty wide range of prices. \n\nWe stopped in last night to get a drink and possibly food. We were a bit disappointed in the food selection, there's not a lot and it's really carb-heavy, which we weren't in the mood for, so we decided just to order a drink and eat elsewhere. I ordered one of the cherry ciders while my friend tried the Honeycrisp one. Both were amazing and delicious.\n\nWe were in early in the evening so the bar was pretty quiet and dead (except for the 90s rock music playing, which was a bit nostalgic). We were taken care of by a friendly server very quickly. Sitting at the window gives you some great views of Polk Street in front and ideally nothing really sketchy will happen while you're watching the people and traffic going by. \n\nI definitely think this would be a great place to go back to.

For food we tried a few of the sliders--the fried chicken, Cajun chicken, and the spicy lamb. We also tried the Turkish flatbread and the buffalo fries.

The turkish flatbread was strongly seasoned; overall it was the best thing we ordered food-wise. The sliders were just okay. Where this place really shines is the cider.

FINALLY! \n After going to several bars/restaurants and being told the only hard cider options were Wyder's (blech!) or nothing, I finally found my heaven. What a wonderful place this is. We took the steps to the gateway of my happy place and my eyes landed on the best cider menu I have ever seen. Sure, some of the ciders were \"drop-on-the-floor\" expensive, but that's why you get the good stuff that is nice and cheap. Take Strongbow, for instance. A wonderful dry cider that was just $5 a bottle. \n I honestly could have cared less how the food tasted, so imagine my surprise when everything we ordered was spot on and absolutely delicious. The potato soufle was superb; by far the best mashed potatoes I have ever had. Next time I visit (and there will be a next time) I'm gonna ask for two of those suckers. The pesto potato pizza was also very tasty, but my boyfriend polished it off before I could so much as breathe in a sliver of it. I ordered the Mac & Cheese with crispy bacon and I thought it was VERY good. Not too cheesy, pasta cooked just right with the bacon not overpowering the dish. To end off the meal we ordered the Caramel Bread Pudding. Once they scraped me off the ceiling (it was that good), I had to be restrained from making out with the chef. Everything was just so perfect! I left on such a buzzed high that I didn't even mind the homeless guy who berated us the entire way to our car for not giving him a quarter for \"a peep show.\"\n Ask for the server Ari.

They have a great selection of ciders. The menu was scanty and unimpressive but we chose a pulled pork flatbread and a meatball dish for dinner.  We proceeded to watch the establishment fill & have the surrounding tables (who ordered after us) receive their food. Waited 40 minutes before we inquired about our order and then watched them scramble to produce it for us. No explanations, apology, or acknowledgment of their error. The food itself was bland and not worth the wait. We won't be returning.", "author": "ali r."}

Despite there being maybe 3-4 tables and at least 4-5 waitstaff we could see, the service was painfully slow.  How long does it take to grab a bottle from the back?!  We spotted waitstaff drinking/hanging out behind the bar, gchatting on a computer that faced the dining area, and generally ignoring us while we waited in vain for the bill.  \n\nI also wasn't a huge fan of the decor, although obviously this is a matter of taste - it was a little too intentionally 'trendy' for me.", "author": "Sara C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-04-07", "description": "The upside to the cleverly named Upcider is, well, the cider.  I have mixed feelings about this spot so will try to separate the good from the bad in a balanced manner.\n\nLet's start with the actual space.  It's a cool idea - a large upstairs space with two walls of windows and a nice window bar overlooking Polk and Sutter - but they really fail on the esthetic execution.  When you reach the top of the stairs you could be in any generic office space trying to decide if the dentist is to the right or to the left.  Not warm at all, but very dark...black walls, black carpet, etc.  Upcider itself is very spacious and you can tell that an attempt was made to turn a mediocre space into an acceptable dining spot.  Unfortunately, they don't quite make it.  The large space is cavernous so the acoustics are terrible, making it difficult to have a conversation, and while we were there the music was way to dance-mixey and loud for the attempted atmosphere.  The bar to the right was the warmest part of the space and, I thought, quite inviting, but since we had a group of four, a table was more practical.   So, I'd give the atmosphere 1.5 stars.\n\nOnce the service got rolling, it was exceptional.  It took a while for our server to initially approach our table, but once she did, she and the other servers, were very attentive and patient with our in depth perusal of the encyclopedic cider list.  This is a minor thing, but I think it would be a nice touch if the servers were knowledgeable about the cider menu so that they could answer questions and make recommendations.  Overall, I'd give the service 4 stars.\n\nI loved the menu and thought the food was outstanding.  I have read some reviews here panning the food, so I don't know if there has been improvement there or if we just have differing tastes, but I thought the food was one of the highlights of the experience.  Everything on the menu (except for one item) is $9.95 or less, and we found everything we tried to be delicious from the sweet potato fries with blueberry ketchup, to the zucchini patties with yogurt sauce all the way through the daily special of bacon-laced mac and cheese.  Definitely not food for those on a diet, but truly some creative and delicious comfort food here.  The food gets a solid 4.5 stars.\n\nSaving the best for last!  The cider menu gets a full 5 stars!  It was comprehensive, offered ciders across a range of prices ($5 - $38/bottle), included helpful descriptions that were pretty accurate, and alcohol content.  If you are a cider fan, or want to learn more about the art of ciders and try sampling them, this is a home run!  I did find myself wishing they had tasting flights, but when we asked for tasting glasses for the table so we could do our own sampling they were promptly and happily delivered.\n\nOverall, if you don't mind a sterile environment that is acoustically challenged, you'll dig this place.  Go for the cider and stay for the food.", "author": "Stacy H."}

So, this joint just opened about a month ago and I am a fan.  I went as a party of 4, a double date with another couple.  We ordered about half their menu + 3 ciders.  We paid $120 with a 20% tip and had leftovers (that sadly got donated by my boyfriend to a nice homeless man).  Everything we ordered was made to order and served hot & fresh.  This is rare for me to say but I was most impressed with their homemade ketchup because I usually hate homemade ketchup.", "author": "Linda W."}

I didn't even know ciders had 5-6% alcohol and taste better then beer :) \n\nWhen me and couple of friends went to Upcider to try some ciders, we also tried some food from their menu. The salmon and bbq pulled pork sliders were great, mushroom flatbread was amazing. \n\nIt's a fun, friendly environment, definitely to try out if you are around Polk street.

I met a friend there and we sat down to watch Polk Street come to life. We ordered the pulled pork slider, and it was so good, we ordered another! Good crunch, nice bit of spice, yummy slaw, fresh bun, and good balance. We got the potato souffle, which was kind of like a mini shepherd's pie; ground beef, whipped potato, and a slight layer of cheese baked on top. Delish! We had to throw a healthy option in there and went for the kale Caesar salad. So much healthier than a regular Caesar, extra crunch from the kale, great garlicky dressing, and house made croutons. Super good!  \nOh right,... the cider! We chose one for a fun name and it was a sweeter variety, but good. For our second helping, we asked for a drier option and they recommended a raspberry cider. It had quite a nose on it. Good strong fruit in the nose, but dry on the palate. Just what we were hoping for!\nThe guys who work there were super helpful and really welcoming. The atmosphere was clean and modern feeling with wood touches that give the space warmth. The quality of the meat is all grass fed, and the herbs are freshly grown by the chef. Reasonable prices, and it fills a cider niche that I haven't seen in the city before. Clearly we needed this place! The bar is concrete with a cool finish on it, and as I mentioned before, there is a panoramic view of Polk Street where you can watch the \"show\" without having to be in it! I'll be back again soon!", "author": "Tei G."}

I really wanted to try the ice cider, but didn't want to pay what I'd normally pay for an entire bottle of wine. Service was a bit slow and timid, they ran out of the macaroni&cheese special and it wasn't even 8PM, and portions are small so I wouldn't necessarily recommend coming for dinner, but all in all a light and airy atmosphere with plenty of space between tables and great views of Polk below.", "author": "Natalie H."}

Pretty good list of ciders, wide range of prices, and what I had was all really good. The service was good, much better than expected after reading some of the reviews - our waitress came over frequently enough, our drinks and food came quickly, the guy who appeared to be the owner checked on us, so all in all, good. I felt like our waitress could have known a bit more about cider though. For most coming in, they're not going to know what to choose so the waitstaff should really be the experts on tastes, flavors, etc. I asked specific questions and I could tell the girl was trying, but couldn't give me a good description of any of them.\n\nFood-wise, we ordered the gruyere and spinach flatbread (good, but a bit heavy on the garlic), the chicken slider (really tasty) and the cajun shrimp which was 5 shrimp with a lot of sauce and crostini. Overall everything was pretty good and prices were decent, maybe the shrimp was a little over-priced. It would be great if they did happy hour specials too - maybe they do, we arrived about 6:45pm.\n\noverall a cool place, but they should definitely hype up the cider thing since it's what they're known for and have their waitstaff educate people on the differences.", "author": "Lauren M."}

I enjoyed the food- I read some of the other reviews before I went and had to order the too \"spicy\" buffalo fries and \"standard\" garlic fries- I don't know why there were negative comments about these I thought they were both good.  I also liked the mom and pop feel to the bar, and as a small business owner myself I can appreciate trying to minimize employee overhead, especially just starting out, so with that in mind I didn't experience any slow service.
