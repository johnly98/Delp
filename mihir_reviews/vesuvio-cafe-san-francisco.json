One star for the decor. This used to be my favorite bar in San Francisco. Any trip to North Beach would require a stop in for a least one drink. When my first book of poetry was published, friends surprised me here for drinks.\n\nThings have changed. At a talk as part of the City Arts & Lecture series, Barry Jenkins was recently talking about making his first film, Medicine for Melancholy, and articulated something I've felt since being here. He said that when you're Black, \"being in love with San Francisco is like being in love with someone who doesn't love you back.\"\n\nI joined two friends and my girlfriend at Vesuvio's this past Saturday (10/13/2018) after performing poetry in ILS Lane as a part of a fundraiser. Those three had gone about 15 minutes ahead of five other friends/performers and myself because they needed to use the restroom.\n\nWhen I arrived, they were sitting at the bar and had just been served two drinks. I came in and spent about 4-5 minutes trying to catch the attention of the bartender to buy a round of drinks for the other five friends and myself because we had just wrapped up the event. I couldn't get his attention, I assumed, because it was busy and decided to wait until he came closer to respect his hustle.\n\nAt this point, two white women approach our little group at the bar. I note that they are white because with the exception of one, everyone else in our group was either Black, Latina, Egyptian, or Afro-Latino. The two women strong armed though the group and say that they were sitting here and point to two drinks covered with napkins. One of the women in our group, asked why they were gone for so long, and they respond that they'd gone to smoke but that we need to move because they've had a long day. \n\nI asked why they thought they were entitled to the space after having been away for nearly 20 minutes and they again referred to the napkins over the drinks. I asked about couple next to us to confirm how long they'd been gone, and they responded, \"definitely over ten minutes.\" So then another woman in our group said that she was comfortable in the seat and asked them to find another space. The two women then push through and take one of the seats from a woman in our group who was sitting. \n\nWe asked the bartender, who finally came over, and he decided that because they had left drinks before leaving that they were indeed entitled to these spots and shooed us all away.\n\nNow, I get that the two women had probably been drinking and that explains why they were so rude, but the bartender was sober and the majority of our group hadn't even gotten the chance to get drinks yet.  I was disgusted. Because it wasn't the type of atmosphere that this place is historically known for. What that bartender did was suggest that drinks for two white women was better than serving drinks to eight people of color. I told them that if that's what they were seriously choosing then I wasn't even angry at them, but I would never drink there again. \n\nAnd I won't. I hope other people of color, creatives, and allies will join me and take your business to Specs across the street or elsewhere.", "author": "Kevin D."}

If those are full I never come here. \n\nThe upstairs has this European vibe I love and miss where you can spend half the night with 5 of your friends looking down on the North Beach streets and having your own little party. It straddles the alley known for poets and musicians, so on a nice evening you can chat with an Irish Coffee and overhear all manner of storytelling.\n\nYou know I could tell a story myself about this place that'd fill a book about a crazy tinder date I had here one time. She was so drunk in the lyft he called me down and an ambulance came to get her, and that's just how it started. She got out the emergency room and asked me where she could get a bottle of bourbon and then things got interesting to say the least. \n\nBut I digress, Vesuvio is a good place to start if you are diving into North Beach for the evening, bottom line.", "author": "John W."}

I got 2x of the Pimms cup and my husband got the north beach drink which he liked and the swinging beat ( he did not like it, tasted a little medicinal). The music was good and even though there was only 1 waitress, she was doing a great job of running up and down. \n\nWe also got ourself on the waitlist at Tonys pizzeria when we sat here which worked out perfectly.\n\nThe place doesn't sell food but you can bring in your own pizza FYI.", "author": "Anju J."}

Even so, every single time I've had a few drinks here I've both felt like I was on holiday and/or in a film. Maybe it's the old-school layout with the thin downstairs seating layout or maybe it's the cozy booths upstairs that overlook the bar. Actually, it's more likely to be the incredible vintage/antique decor and the fact that it was Kerouac's hang. \n\nI'm a big fan of the neighborhood. I'm sure for many it's touristy, but I like the split of locals and visitors. I don't ever find it overwhelmingly bogged down by newbies and outside the bar you'll always find a new person to meet and greet. Right on the doorstep of Vesuvio you'll find a bunch of great restaurants--one within a stone's throw that has amazing mozzarella. I forget the name! You'll find it, I'm sure.\n\nLastly, I totally recommend an early happy hour if you want to gather a small group for creative talks, a game of cards, or simply to enjoy the space.

I can't put it into words. The closest I can come is that, being here makes me feel like I'm part of something bigger. The bar attracts a certain type of person and perhaps others also feel called to be there, I don't know.\n\nAt first glance the interior might seem tacky or comparable to an Applebee's but upon closer look you'll notice that most of what is on the walls has been there for a very long time. Like the visible roots of a tree. A sign of what has been there for decades since this bar first opened in 1948.\n\nI'd like to think that this bar draws me in because it's a place for intellectuals and I consider myself an intellectual. But I also have mixed feelings as though I'm not worthy. Having a drink at this bar is literally an honor. An honor to be in the presence of past and present.\n\nI make a point to stop here nearly every time I am in San Francisco. I have always been lucky enough to snag a table (not sure how) as the place does fill up. A couple of times I've had to share a larger table and without fail, end up meeting other amazing people who are the best of company. \n\nAlthough Cafe is in the name, they do not serve food but as long as you clean up after yourself they allow you to bring outside food in. \n\nNext time you're in town, stop in.

She was rushing us to order, giving us attitude because we weren't ready after sitting down for literally like five minutes. One of my friend even heard her saying to another group of customer \"thank god you're not like that group over there\" and pointed to us. She ever made fun of the birthday girl choice of drink! Who does that! The bar itself is amazing but the service was horrible and I mean HORRIBLE!!!! Super snobby, rude, and was acting like we did something wrong to her.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-05-13", "description": "This is a iconic San Francisco bar that was a hangout for avant garde literary and rock and roll types back in the day. Both Jack Kerouac  and Grace Slick were known to hang out here amongst other famous and semi famous peeps.\n\nLocated just an alley away from chinatown on columbus, parking is on the street which means that there is no parking. You are gonna have to stash the ride somewhere else and uber/bus/walk/whatever on in here.\n\nThe inside has both upstairs and downstairs sections with tons of snug (the danish word for this is hyggeligt-pronounced hoog-lie). For you norteamericano types consider it very cozy. There is not a lot of room to move around, but there is a truly fascinating amount of memorabilia on the walls, and overall it's well decorated. \n\nAs usual the quickest drink service is at the bar, but there is table service if you'd prefer. This place can get super busy as well-I've seen times where there were people lined up waiting to get in, and when it does get crowded that inside gets considerably less cozy. Fighting your way up or down steps when people are just standing around blocking things can be less then fun. I should also mention that the restrooms are up or down a flight of stairs depending on your seating location(actually it could two flights of stairs) thus posing a challenge to the inebriated. As such this may not be the place to go crazy with the drinking. A few drinks, fine, but a few too many and you'll be tumbling down a set of steps just prior to being kicked out.\n\nAbout the service. You hear about those places where the rudeness is considered part of the places attractiveness? Ya know like in a seinfeld episode? (if you don't know what Seinfeld is, ask your parents.) Yeah, so the staff here can be less then zestfully enthusiastic. Didn't bother me so much, as I wasn't expecting a fine touch on the day I came. Beer and a shot was what I came for and I knew the brands I wanted when the waitress came. In the staff's defense I think running drinks up and down stairs to indecisive tourists who aren't into tipping could be a real pain in the ass. Or maybe they are just doing the Seinfeld curtness thing. Either way you prolly won't be able to charm thy waitstaff, but there is no harm in trying.\n\nAlso note that if you are using a card it's a ten dollar minimum, not inclusive of the tip. The good news here is that is essentially a beer and a shot.\n\nI kinda liked it. I'd go back especially if it's not crowded. It's kinda hep.", "author": "Steven W."}

Walked away quite rudely and then came back and slammed our check on the table while walking away saying \"thanks folks\".  I was appalled and quite frankly, felt really disrespected. She needs an attitude adjustment. It was not okay. I didn't even order a drink. I'm so upset I'm writing this as we wait for our ride share. Because we are happy and smiling she assumed we were drunk. We were there only about 15 minutes. I didn't  know it was wrong to change your mind about a drink you want; but Kaitlyn sure did make us feel that way. She made me feel like we were in the wrong part of town. When she came back to pick up the tab she said our guys were the problem. That we had ordered several times at the bar and changed our minds.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-05-03", "description": "Admittedly, I am not a great \"Beat-Generation\" mind.  I'd probably appreciate Vesuvio even more than I already do if I knew more about some of its former patrons like Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg.  One of the pangs I feel from time to time is that my view of San Francisco is based on the post-Great Recession economic explosion of the last five years.  I know North Beach has changed a lot, but I see a window into past when I visit.  Some of the echoes can be heard if you find the right spots.  This is one of those spots.\n\nVesuvio dates back to the late 1940's, in the post-WWII crucible of American dominance and affluence.  In that crucible, the Beat Generation of the 1950's started asking questions about the way our society was really ordered.  Sitting in Vesuvio, it's not hard to imagine the conversations back in those days.  This is in large part because you'll still hear those conversations today.  It's a spot for drinking, thinking, talking and repeating that cycle.  It draws a huge range of visitors, from neighborhood types to tourists.  It's a welcoming spot.  \n\nHistory aside, it's a cool bar.  You are on Columbus, and this block is sort of the official beginning of North Beach.  I love the lay-out, which features a bar ringed by tables on the ground floor, and a mezzanine-level above which is open above the bar and has floor-to-ceiling windows looking out to Columbus and Jack Kerouac Alley.  This layout gives almost every seat a feel of spacious-intimacy.  The decor has plenty of historical flavor.  There are a couple of cool side features like the Lady Psychiatrist's Booth and the John Wilkes Memorial Booth (BTW - not a tribute to the assassin, more a tribute to puns).  Full bar, eight beers on draft, some wine-offerings and a few listed specials.  Prices are good considering they get plenty of tourists.  And, they open EARLY.  8am Monday through Friday, 6am on the weekends.   They employ very solid bartenders.\n\nIf you are an visitor to SF, you should stop in.  If you are a local, it's worth a visit while enjoying a nice afternoon in North Beach.  And, maybe hit Wikipedia and learn something about the history of The Beat, if you didn't already.  It's a cool spot.  It has to be cool, though.  Bob Dylan used to drink here.", "author": "Adam S."}

My boyfriend directed us to a bar that so happened to be a favorite place of his.  While it is called a \"caf\u00e9,\" no food is served there.  This colorful and historic 2 story lounge is well known in San Francisco as the original place where \"beat nicks\" hung out, recited poetry, and played their music for patrons.  The walls are covered from top to bottom with art and historical photographs. The ally next to this building often features a small arts and crafts fair that draws tourists and locals alike, which we took the time to browse through.  \n\nThe Vesuvio is somewhat cramped inside as one would expect in an old historic building, but I had one of the nicest times there with my best friend, my sister and my boyfriend!  There is something to be said about mixing friends, fun, old memories and alcoholic beverages together in a corner bar of San Francisco on a Sunday afternoon!  It didn't take long to make our hour long break put smiles on our faces and renew our energy to continue sight seeing as we joined the other members of our party who were still in search of souvenirs.  \n\nThe bar was fairly busy inside, but I couldn't imagine being there when it is crowded.  There was only one bathroom each for men and women, and you had to go either up or down a flight of steep stairs to get to them.  We had a nice waitress who checked on us often and even though I originally was disappointed that my cocktail was served in a rather small glass, they didn't skimp on the alcohol.  Then when Debbie Z. bought us another round, my disappointment faded away from \"what a small glass,\" to \"this little drink packs a punch!\"  \n\nWhen you create great memories and have a good time with people you love at a neighborhood bar, you can't help but give it a good rating!  \"I love you man!\"\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzmO6KKLvVQ", "author": "Ida H."}

A little standing ledge eventually opened up (you could not put seats here no matter how hard you tried) so my friend and I stood there. I was told I had to switch my tab over to the server. OK. I mean, we were still standing and less than five feet from the bar but whatever you want. Another hour, the bar clears out and we find our selves at stools on the left side of the bar. My next order I'm informed that the bartender isn't taking tabs tonight (?) so it must be with the bartender on the right -  they are less than ten feet from each other. We pay in cash to forget this nonsense. When leaving I try to pay my tab with the server but she cashed it out because she \"hadn't seen you for two hours\". \n\nIf you have ever been in here and realize that I'm only talking about the first floor - an almost empty first floor - you know how ridiculous that sounds.\n\nI'll be back but I'll bring some cash this time.

Definitely not one of the typical fancy bars that you would expect in downtown sf.

She came over twice to ask us \"what would you guys like to drink?\" when it was clear that we were still in a conversation and a few of us have yet to finish the drinks in our hands. If you would like for us to move or free up the table, I would much rather have you tell us directly and ask us to move.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-10-30", "description": "Even though this past weekend I had a 2 star experience, I'm giving this review 4 stars because I love this bar. This is where I met my fianc\u00e9 and we even took our engagement photos here a couple months ago. We have an artwork piece of Vesuvio hung in our living room. Anytime friends ask us where they should go when they visit SF -- we always suggest Vesuvio. Vesuvio will always have a special place in our hearts.\n\nYet, on Friday, 10/27 I sat upstairs in Vesuvio. I know Vesuvio isn't known for top-notch service, yet I was really shocked the way my friend and I were treated that evening. I arrived around 4pm, killing about 2 hours waiting for my friend. Within that time, I purchased 2 beers and left my card open. When my friend arrived around 6pm, the server asked to see her ID. At that moment, my friend realized she left her purse at her office. Understandably, the server told her she couldn't be served and had to leave the bar.  We completely understood so I immediately asked for the check because I had my card open and we started to gather our things to leave together.\n\nIn less than 30 seconds, the server comes back - hands me the bill and as I'm signing she tells my friend \"You need to leave now. The ABC can come in any second.\" I responded by saying \"We know, that's why I asked for the check...\" We literally had our purses on our shoulders and it would have been a difference of 10 seconds if she left right at that moment vs. waiting for me to sign. She then says \"Ok.\" and then turns to the register and says \"JESUS!!!\" loud enough for all the other customers upstairs to hear. My friend and I looked at each other immediately, completely shocked. I turned around and said \"Jesus?\" The server heard me but ignored me and started to walk downstairs and then halfway down she stopped and shouted \"Do you have a problem?\" and I said \"Me? Do YOU have a problem?\" and she said \"Ya. I do!\" but instead of coming back upstairs to discuss it with us she continued to walk down the stairs. It was so, so bizarre and I almost felt like we were being pranked. Even after that I still tipped her, signed the check, and we left.\n\nI understand that the server was \"just doing her job\" - but there's definitely a certain way you approach customers. The way she spoke to us she had an incredible attitude and she was unnecessarily aggressive. I get it, we were in the wrong with the ID thing. But we obviously understood we needed to leave the first time she told us, that's why I asked for the check. It's not like we were leaned back on our chairs looking like we weren't urgently trying to leave. I've worked for hospitality where IDs are required, and this was not the way to go about it. I was disappointed that night, yet, like I said in the beginning -- Vesuvio will always be a special place to me.", "author": "emily h."}

After coming to San Francisco for years, I'm pretty embarrassed that Vesuvio has only recently come on to my radar. That's a major miss for me. Vesuvio seems like the quintessential SF hang to cool out for a minute, man.*\n\nBack before the tech boom, $3950 studios and sea of trust fund babies, SF was known for drugs, poetry, drugs, music, drugs, books, drugs, peace, drugs, being stinky, and drugs. Chief amongst their pioneer crackheads were the Beats. This is their place. Walking into Vesuvio is a glimpse into what SF used to be. Some may call it pretension. Some may call for the hippies to get a job. Some may call out for another drink. But whatever you're calling for, unless you're not from this world, you're going to hear the call to turn on, tune in, drop out. Since I have to work, I just opted to look at the pretty colors and have a beer.\n\nThere's lots to look at. The main floor has a lot of action but I like the vantage point from the perch on the second floor. The posters, lights, paint, postcards, graffiti, papers, and what not all tell stories. If you're here by yourself, read them, listen to them. Or, if you're here with a friend, be present and have a full on conversation. I wouldn't advise coming here with a large group unless you're harkening back to the Beats and in that case... well, do whatever you want. They did. But, I think a place like vesuvio is best experienced in quiet. Conversation can be quiet when it's present and sincere. This is as good as place as any to practice both. Turn Off your cell phone/iPad. Tune In to the company with which you came. Drop In to the bathroom (it's rad).\n\n*That's my beatnik impression. Not so good, I know.", "author": "Johnny T."}

Like someone else said, it's worth it to take a leak exactly where Jack Kerouac, Ginsberg, Burroughs, etc. all did. I don't know why, but it is.\n\nThe decor is very cool, a mix of Beat memorabilia, Jazz stuff, pub stuff, and random funkiness. Reminds me of Casino El Camino in Austin, TX (minus the amazing burgers, sadly).\n\nThere's a good beer selection, full bar, happy hour, and nice, talkative folks around (though liable to complain about all the tourists). Get some books at City Lights, then sit down with a beer at Vesuvio, and there you go, you are all set.\n\nThere are no TVs (downstairs, anyway, didn't go up). This is not a sports bar.

Either that, or find another place to work.\n\nMAY 9, 2016 about 8:45am. I walk in and ask if the bar is open. The brunette, kinda plumb, kinda tall, middle-aged woman behind the counter says, \"yes.\" So I ask for a drink. Now mind you, I ask for a drink after I ask repeatedly \"really? really? really?\" if the bar really is open. SF is no NYC or LA. It tends to be a city that sleeps early, works hard, and well, that's about it...So naturally, I was genuinely surprised to find something with liquor that was open before 9am.  Anyhow, after replying that the bar is open, she tells me no I can't order a drink because I look like I'm on something. I berate her a little bit. I'm very sorry I look like a hobo because I forgot my Louis Vuitton shoes back in LA but the thing is, I'm the one that can afford them and not her. My manner of speech can be rather abrupt. And the way I dress is not very well put together when I'm trotting around the streets of SF looking for a bar that claims to be as unpretentious as this one, Kerouac legacy bs and all that, etc. \n\nI actually like unpretentious, quirky little places with a history. All I got was pretentiousness from a woman who has no place on a pedestal of pretentious. Maybe I had a rough night. Maybe I'm already a young-ish woman who is incredibly insecure and sensitive at times, so the bitch behind the bar certainly hit a nerve when she said that I looked like I was on drugs. I have my share of problems, but drugs is not one. Even with backstory aside, there is no reason for that woman to have treated me so indignantly. \n\nI strongly advise the owner usher this woman to another place of employment that involves no customers.

We grabbed a booth upstairs in the corner, so able to hear one another speak.The sign above us read \"Booth for Lady Psychiatrists\" which made us all smile with anticipation of the specialty drink menu (which we all ordered off of).\n\nAs soon as our server came, it was an awful experience.\n\nNo smile, no warm greeting, just a straight face asking what we wanted. Being slightly buzzed from brunch earlier, all of us were excited to be in SF being that we all were there visiting from LA for the 21st birthday. Mentioning this, we asked what the best drink would be for the birthday girl. Our server handed us the menus, and quickly walked off.\n\nWhen the server arrived back, a quick glare from her stating silently that her time was money and we knew we should order ASAP. One girl after the other gave their cocktail order, and as we approached the last of our group, our server walked away before my friend could even finish her sentence of a 'Moscow Mule.' We hoped she got all of our orders?\n\nServer then arrived with our drinks and walked off without saying anything to us. \n\nDrinks were good, but we were ready to get out of there as soon as we were about half way done. Finally getting our servers attention, we politely asked for the check. She then explained, \"Your bill is $50.00 even including tip.\"\n\nOdd that a single cocktail round between 6 girls would already include gratuity? But we didn't care to question this. As all of us reached out for our credit cards, our server exclaimed, \"only one card.\" A bit annoyed considering none of us had cash, I offered to just pay the bill on my card and not make the situation any more awkward than it had gotten already. \n\nWhen returning with my debit, I saw that my receipt had a written tip in it from my server:\n\nTotal: $50.00\nTip: $8.00 (---this was physically written by the server)\nTotal: $58.00\n\nCompletely shocked, considering this is forgery and unless stated on the menu of added gratuity, tip is solely at the customers discretion. I called to the server once in sight again, and she looked me in the eyes as I calmly explained this (all 6 of us girls have and still work in the restaurant biz, so this wasn;t going unnoticed), and she said \"well, my manager told me to do that. So, you can go down and talk to him about it.\" I said I would, and asked for the manager and her name. She gave it, and scurried off.\n\nStill in dismay, we sat at the table and wondered if it was even worth speaking to the manager. We had a great time and didn't feel like putting anymore of a dark cloud on the day. As I was about to sign my name, the server came back and took the receipt, and as she scratched out the tip she wrote in, she said, \"you know what, forget it. I don't even want the tip anymore.\" and stomped away.\n\nNow, COMPLETELY over this whole scene, I signed as my tab, my friends and I got our coats on and proceeded downstairs.\n\nAs we walked by the bartender/manager, one of my friends exclaimed, \"by the way, your server was extremely rude to us.\" He looked at her in anger, and said \"well YOU tried to get free drinks for your friends birthday from her.\" Taken aback, my friend told him he was entirely wrong, and VERBATIM, he said back:\n\"Yeah? Well you're a liar and a f*cking c*nt!\"\n\nNeed I say more? A disappointing representation of what SF is all about. I have never received such poor and disrespectful service in my entire life.

I came here one night recently alone, not in the mood for a scene, but definitely in the mood for a drink after dinner in Little Italy. I hadn't been to Vesuvio in about 7 years and hoped it hadn't changed much from how I remembered it-dark, inviting and cheap. I recalled sitting upstairs and enjoying the view, as I hung out with my friends. I might have even vowed back then to come back alone so I could get lost in my dreams, as I am apt to do.\n\nI did just that on my recent visit. It was just what I needed at the start of a busy work week, to stare out at all the people walking around Columbus Ave, making up lives for them, while pretending that  I was at one of my favorite spots in Greenwich Village (which of course was the East Coast Beat stomping ground) and so I did just that on my most recent visit, vodka soda in one hand and a notebook and pen in the other, although I didn't write down a word (OK, so the notebook part is a lie. Seven years ago, however, I would have definitely had the notebook and I might have even gazed at my navel a bit).\n\nI'm not sure if the night had some kind of special going on, or if the friendly bartender forgot to add in one of my drinks, because when I paid my tab, I was shocked by how cheap it was.

She was confrontational and unnecessarily hostile. The costumer, a soft spoken African American woman, seemed embarrassed but when she asked the bartender why she was so rude, she didn't apologize but only raised her voice more, asking if the woman \"had something to say.\" As if this weren't bad enough, another bartender, a woman with short blonde hair, came up behind her and loudly told the customer to \"just leave.\"\n\nI was uncomfortable watching this exchange and I could tell that other people at the bar were, too. Maybe the woman behind the bar was having a bad day. Maybe she dislikes her job. It could be coincidence that she lashed out at the only person of color I could see in the place.

Across the street are the world's sketchiest strip clubs. Walk a ways down and you can grab a nice meal at an outdoor table in the Italian section.\n\nVesuvio is a throwback to the days of Beat writing and Beat poetry. You can just imagine tons of people in black turtlenecks and striped jeans drinking whiskey and discussing politics or philosophy or reciting poetry. We went and there was an annoying group of Austrailians, a guy in a top hat on heroine who was passing out in his booth, a bunch of young hippie looking types writing in notebooks and a smattering of 20-30 something year old couples.\n\nThe best deal by far is $5 for a pint glass of beer and a shot of Wild Turkey whiskey. They also have a chalkboard up next to the bar with 'special wines' ... you can get a bottle of wine for $15 from this board. The drinks here are dirt cheap.\n\nThe place looks like it hasn't been updated (or cleaned) since Jack Kerouac and Bob Dylan used to drink here after stopping at City Lights. Kerouac was a bastard ... and an alchoholic ... thankfully most of the crowd was not as belligerant and sloppy as I am sure he used to get here.\n\nThe bar on the bottom level is nice and there are a few tables as well. The top level is my favorite part ... there are small tables that have windows which look out over the busy street and ally. And there are also two big booths which look over the bar. You can see the original gas chandaliers still lit with flames. These booths are great for discussions.\n\nDay drinking here is alright but at night its such a divey scene, that is my favorite time to go. If you are staying in Fisherman's Wharf, there is a great cheesesteak cash only joint on the walk back open late at night. Do not under any circumstances go into the strip clubs across the street. That was an experience that would make Jack Kerouac himself blush. Yuck.\n\nThe only thing I didn't like about Vesuvio is the lack of decent music playing. I felt like they could use a jukebox ... or some better tunes.", "author": "E T."}

Despite living in SF for nearly a year, I had yet to really explore or spend any quality time in North Beach. Nor had he, and so he figured best to expand his horizons and get out of the typical NoPa-Lower Haight-Haight scene. I came here without any preconceptions (only now after looking it up again I understand the historic aspect of it - apparently I have some learning to do). It's a dark, cozy place with bar stools, tables and an upstairs (ladies room here) with additional seating. Otherwise, you'll probably be standing if it's a busy night.\n\nWe had about a dozen folks in our group, and someone managed to arrive early enough to score a table in the back. The place was moderately crowded for a Saturday night with an eclectic mix of people milling about. I don't imagine there are many places in the city where hipsters, Asian students, the after work crowd, and old timers can really mingle so well. The drinks were poured fairly strong and were fairly priced. What I was most amazed by was the memory of our server - she was tops (I wish I remembered her name because she deserves a hand). We never waited too long for her to check up on us, nor for our drinks to be delivered.\n\nIf I was in the area, I would definitely stop by again.

Less appealing were the drifters that seemed to be picking out armpit lint next to the building (seriously, more than one).

I could drink a Stella Artois at home, but I'd never pass up the opportunity to pass up said drink if I could do so in a bar like Vesuvio.\n\nWith prohibition specials like \"Bud and Bourbon\" and the ever-popular absinthe on the menu, Vesuvio is a bar that is full of character. The second floor is even cooler, giving you a view of not only the varied patrons, but also some of the most random of memorabilia.

The kind that can only be achieved over decades of good, simple service. \n\nThere's bric-a-brac galore on the walls and shelves, but it's the furthest thing from the carefully planned randomness you'd find cluttering an Applebee's. What they have at Vesuvio seems like it's there because, well, shit just accumulates over the decades as a favorite gathering place of the people. \n\nThe service is friendly and efficient, the prices more than reasonable, and the clientele diverse and interesting. \n\nAs an added bonus, it's got one of the more unique men's rooms you'll find...down a low slung stairwell and into a doorless storage room with urinals seemingly interspersed with the empty kegs and boxes. Character is revealed in many ways. \n\nOne of my favorite simple pleasures is ordering a stiff drink, then letting my eyes and imagination wander as I gaze around and listen to the place from a seat at the bar or the balcony. \n\nThat gentle buzz comes over you and you just sort of blend into the glorious past of the venerable Vesuvio.", "author": "Alfredo M."}

One of our stops was Vesuvio since one of the girls had been before. My first experience was okay since it was really crowded and we didn't stay longer than the time to have one drink. \n\nHowever, this past Saturday I returned and around 12:45AM, we were lucky and the back of the upstairs balcony area had open tables. One of my best girlfriends and I (and her sister) took a window table and chatted over a couple drinks till they closed. If you can get a good seat and have a few drinks here, Vesuvio is amazing. Very laidback and unique place - it's got a vibrant environment, yet you can still carry on a conversation perfectly without having to hunch over and yell. \n\nIf you don't mind the occasional smell that this place has, you're in for great & cheap (YES!) drinks, friendly service, and a unique environment to sip and enjoy the night away.", "author": "Tiffany K."}

I work in the FiDi, so I'm close enough that I can come here several times a week; sometimes for lunch, sometimes after work. They always have good music going, no matter what the genre. Seating is plentiful, I've been there at many different hours of the day and I've never not gotten a seat. They don't serve food, but you're more than welcome to bring your lunch/dinner along with you.\n\nThere's always good people-watching here, you're practically on the corner of Broadway/Columbus, which is the heart of North Beach. You get a healthy balance of locals, tourists, super nice people, suits and complete whack jobs. Vesuvio is mentioned in a lot of tourist guides, so this is definitely a destination spot for people who are visiting San Francisco.\n\nLastly, they have one of the best deals I've seen in any bar, anywhere: the Recession Special. The Recession Special is a shot of whiskey (Old Crow) and a glass of beer (Bud) for $4. I know, I know, I've heard the arguments and seen the faces; Old Crow and Bud? Gross!

My hubs and I were visiting last week and decided to go for a beer on a rainy afternoon. Still love the space - kind of divey and good people watching both in the bar and on the street. The bartender was super friendly. \n\nI had always remembered this place as having a good selection of beer on tap (i'm a beer snob) but this was not the case (at least for me). For Hefeweizenr, they had Widmer (blah!) Why not a Franziskaner or Hoegarten? Or even a Great White? They also offer a small selection  of special \"microbrews\". So maybe you would think to see something from Deschutes Brewery or some crazy good beer like Hitachimo Nest. But that is not the case - the selection included Fat Tire and Blue Moon. Are these really considered MIcrobrews? Blue Moon isn't a horrible beer but I wouldn't consider this a special mircrobrew either - it's brewed by Coors! \n\nAnyway, I figured I would stick with a classic Stella that was on tap and the hubs ordered a Guinness.  My Stella was so horribly flat, I couldn't even drink it and my hubs Guinness wasn't very fresh. The bartender didn't charge us for the Stella, which was nice but she could see I didn't drink it. \n\nWhile we were sitting at Vesuvio, we yelped other bars in the area and thankfully found a much better place to enjoy some real beer (the Columbus Cafe).

The drinks came in handy to lighten the mood since our server was apparently too busy gossiping with the bartender to remember she was at work. Numerous folks walked in and sat down only to be ignored for ten minutes before exiting. I think more people left than actually got served that day. We joked when a group went upstairs to the balcony seating since we knew that they were going to be waiting a while but they did have great bleacher seats to watch others drinking below.

Came through on a Tuesday night so not crowded by any means. From the outside the stain glass windows backlit with the name are pretty ole timey but appropriate and draw you right inside. There are little seating nooks and old art and books and posters and ancient chandeliers everywhere. This place is well known for being a haunt of jack Kerouac and the like and it's obvious why. The bar still has a drink named after him that's rum tequila orange juice and cranberry juice. Not a bad drink, but not too strong either. Don't expect to be getting drunk on their cocktails here. They're more for the habit not to mess you up. There's always someone there drinking an IPA and reading philosophy in the corner and with just the right noir lighting overhead. There's an upstairs which looks over the whole interior that is pretty awesome and has windows so u can watch over the city all the strip clubs and bar surrounding the area. \n\nThe drinks in this place aren't moderate in terms of price. Most cocktails being 7$ and beers around 5$. The cocktails aren't strong. But you can't go wrong with a 5$ beer. They even have a \"recession\" special that's a shot and a beer for 6$. The bartender was prob a nice guy but I didn't talk to him. The woman sorta serving was really friendly though and brought our drinks to the table and everything. Pretty chill. \n\nThe only downside to this place is the location. Not like proximity to other stuff just being over in north beach. It's like so far from where I normally spend time in sf that it's a serious trek to get over there and parking isn't too fun either. There's a lot of cool places around that I want to check out as well when I have more money and better drinking habits.\n\nAnyways highly recommend this place. It's not touristy and it has the vibe that the same type of people are still coming here since back in the day.", "author": "Harrison M."}

Vesuvio is a SF landmark, as it should be.  It was a haunt by Jack Kerouac and was used as the background for a certain Mike Myers movie I care not to disclose.\n\nThe bar is cool.  It host an eclectic crowd:  your locals, the tourists, couples, groups, singles, really cool people, pompous know-it-alls, and your occasional clubber gone astray.  Diversity is what makes San Francisco tick, and it's what makes Vesuvio tick.\n\nAs you enter the bar, in a corner entrance, you can see that Vesuvio doesn't offer much to please the eyes, but it offers history and an aura not easily found in other establishments.  The barkeeps are usually cool and fast.  I usually like to order my drink from them and head off upstairs if the downstairs area is too packed.  There's someone that can take your order upstairs, but it's preference over convenience for me...I just don't like anyone spilling a drop of my precious nectar through the narrow staircase.\n\nVesuvio is definitely a must go for anyone visiting San Francisco for the first time.

It also feels like you need to carry a couple of pistols in your holster and kick someone's ass all the way across the bar before you order a drink.  Lots of variety in drink and really cool wait-staff/bartenders are to be found in here. The crowd is nicely mixed in both age and in other notable and entertaining areas.  It was pretty much standing room only when we were doin' our thang (not good for the 1 armed 1 toilet-ed upstairs in-the-attic bathroom though). \n\nSoooo, do yer thang in here - you even have large windows to see out in the alley to watch the group of occasional bongers.

Diggin' it?  \n\nBeat poets and followers have paid many visits to Vesuvio for decades. This queen was in the city alone and decided to pay tribute to a destination that an influential generation of writers visited.\n\nOnce inside and comfortable with a beer,surrounded by friendly patrons/bartenders, I noticed the following: A good number of beer on tap, red stools, scattered tables, a tv, artsy-ness, and an upstairs area. I came in for a beer but drank 2 frothy Guinness' --all served by an extremely cool (very beat) bartender. Bread and visa/mc is accepted, though there is a $10 minimum.\n\nThe men and women who were sitting with me at the bar were outgoing, but I have a feeling that it had to do with the stiff drinks they were telling me about. Within an hour and a half, we had a hard spiel on LA, San Francisco, music, traveling, careers, food, life, and ended it with a debate on The Beatles and Pearl Jam. One of the drunker men mentioned that Pearl Jam has much more of an influence on music than The Beatles ever did. Again, he was drunk, so I discredited everything he said, but not before I picked his brain. At the end of the day, it was all for kicks. \n\nThis joint delivers on all levels of hip, which is obvious why beat poets drank here in the 50's and 60's. I finaled back to the east bay content with beers and knowing that I drank under the roof that Jack Kerouac and Dean Moriarty did 50+ years ago. Vesuvio is definitely a groovy bar that left me feeling fresh and copacetic.", "author": "J J."}

After having it on my list for quite some time, I finally got around to checking it out last night. A girl pal of mine and I took a walk to North Beach, did some browsing at City Lights Books, and then strolled in for a drink or two. \n\nI have to say from the minute I walked in, I completely loved the place. It had plenty of seating, a good vibe, and the decor was pretty artsy fartsy cool. We decided to head upstairs and chose a seat overlooking the bar, on the side across from a huge, colorful mural. I'm not sure there is a bad seat here, but we liked ours. \n\nWe were pleasantly surprised to locate drink menus and also to find we were greeted by a waitress. At that point we weren't sure if there would be service upstairs. She was patient and super sweet in explaining the specials and showing us the beer selection listed on the wall behind us. \n\nWe decided on 21st Amendment Watermelon Wheat Beer -- delish! I'm so glad my friend recommended it since I've been homesick for my Abita Purple Haze and Strawberry Harvest (New Orleans beers that were much more accessible in Houston than in the Bay Area for obvious reasons). At only $5 a beer, I was happy with that. \n\nWe stayed and chill for a couple while light jazz music played in the background. Good times were had by all. \n\nThe Verdict: I will be a regular here, oh yes. I will be a regular.", "author": "Cara S."}

But, I don't really have a choice after the inexplicably rude and offensive service we received for no apparent reason. \n\nWas having a great time watching the 4th of July fireworks on a rooftop in the FiDi, and decided to pop into one of the neighborhood bars for a couple beers to celebrate. \n\nWalking up Columbus, we decided to poke our heads into Vesuvio, which somehow as a native San Franciscan I had never gone to before. \n\nA tall, dirty,bearded bouncer in a hooded sweatshirt abruptly stops our entrance and demands to see IDs. Fair enough. My buddy pulls out his, and the bouncer grabs it and coughs all over it. Nervously, my friend starts laughing, to which the bouncer threateningly responds \"what are you laughing at\"? My friend takes back his ID and walks in. Then it's my turn. Guy grabs my ID, looks at it, and throws it to the floor, staring back at me. I bend over and grab it and walk in, at first thinking this was just part of the hipster \"schtick\" until I realized this guy was just being a prck for no reason whatsoever. \n\nI bring up our experience to our waitress, who agrees that that is inexcusable behavior, but no one in the bar offers us an apology or any sort of explanation of why we were treated so disrespectfully.\n\nBottom line: avoid this place like the plague.

I was with 3 friends yesterday and suggested that we pop in and have a drink at the \"historic\" Vesuvio bar.  The downstairs was dark, and there was only one table, so, at the suggestion of one friend who scoped out the upstairs area, we decided to head for a window seat.  As we started upstairs, we saw a female server, and we said, \"We are going to sit upstairs,\" to which she sighed painfully and loudly and said, \"Would you order BEFORE you go upstairs?\"  Like obedient children, we all ordered our drinks and climbed to the second floor.\n\nWhen we were upstairs, we noted only 2-tops next to the windows, and, after taking our seats, we thought of moving chairs a bit so that we could all sit together.  The \"sighing server\" showed up with our drinks as we rearranged the chairs and looked at us as if we have committed a homicide, saying, \"Uh, I don't THNK so.  You are NOT moving anything around up here.\"  We told her that we were just trying to set up a spot where we could be together, and she said, \"Nothing gets moved.\"\n\nOne of my friends is a tourist who has never visited San Franciso, and he was horrified.  We all sat and rather cringed, but, even worse, when she returned to her station downstairs, my tourist friend said, \"She is talking about us with a frown and a sour face.\"  \n\nI always took my East Coast friends to Vesuvio, but I will not sit for a repeat performance.  It is such a shame that such a historice spot would employ such a nasty witch.  I will not be back, and I will recommend to all I know to avoid the nasties of the Vesuvio bar.

I'm convinced that 90% of a perfect Bloody Mary comes from adding each of these by hand. After that, it only gets better.

Since this bar caters to people who have heard of Jack Kerouac, I expected it to be an exception to that anti-tourist pompousness, but it reeks of it.  And both barmaids working while I was there told me they'd never read anything Kerouac wrote, but one seemed to me to enjoy my rambling about his writing and mine and other things, reaffiming my notion that bartenders make bars anywhere.", "author": "Billy Lee H."}

My roommates love the Recession Special (Bud + Old Crow) for $4... and this place also makes pretty tasty White Russians. If you're into that.\n\n2) There's table service, which can sometimes be a bit slow, but its cool. Everyone's nice and happy, and the warm lighting makes you both sleepy and mildly desirous of everyone around you.\n\n3) Lots of seating... a clean ladies room... and a great wealth of Beatnik paraphernalia plastered on every surface. For those of you who'd like to spend a night sitting where Jack Kerouac may have placed his iconoclastic bottom, you'll be thrilled to be here. The crowd is usually a bit mixed... casual businessmen, tourists, some hipsters, and the normal bar-going population (whomever fits into this category, I assume you'll self-define).\n\n4) It's a good bar in North Beach (and those are hard to find).

As I was sitting at a table here, overlooking the street below... I turned to the man sitting next to me and said, \"You know, this seems like the kind of place that, if we were living in a TV show, would be our hang out spot. 'Friends' had Central Perk, 'How I Met Your Mother' has MacLaren's, and our show would have Vesuvio.\" Which, you know, would be awesome. I wish I lived nearer to this place instead of 6 hours away from it. I might not drink all the time, but it would definitely be an interesting place to meet up with friends. It was pretty in a victorian sort of way, and very San Franciscan. \n\nThe five of us in our group stayed for quite a while, waiting to meet up with my boyfriend who had been out on business all day. I had two drinks over the course of, what, 3 hours?... and still managed to get drunk. To be fair, I think my vodka cranberry was actually just vodka with a little bit of pink food coloring. It was the first drink I've ever had that I had to sit there and nurse, and I don't even particularly enjoy the taste of alcohol. I might have been gone after that, but I still went in for a long island. Also, it was here that I found out what a long island actually is. Turns  out, they're not actually made with tea. They're made with ALL the alcohol, and a little bit of soda or something. This was also the first one I've had that wasn't dark brown. The last thing I remember is ordering a gin and tonic to have waiting for Dan when he got there, because he hadn't had the greatest of days. Oh, wait... I also remember chanting \"fus roh Dan\" as he came to join us. Did I mention we're all nerds? Then again, if you understood the reference, you're kind of a nerd, too.\n\nAnyhow, after that it all kind of goes dark, and stays dark until a little while later when I was sucking down vegetable spaghetti at some restaurant across town. This place doesn't kid around with their drinks, and also, it was only 8 dollars for a long island. 8 dollars for blackout-in-a-cup. I've been to an LA bar that charged 16 dollars for a drink with the same name, but that couldn't possibly have been the same drink. I'm slowly starting to think I live in the wrong place. \n\nI really enjoyed Vesuvio. If I had to spend 3 hours waiting for someone, I'm glad it was here.", "author": "Terin C."}

Like another reviewer said, THIS is a bar that you can just hang out at without all the loud music that blows out your ear drums and the ridiculous people trying to make out or hook up with each other.  While other bars take the initiative and lure you in with the machismo of sex and the raw aggression of alcoholism, Vesuvio is quite different, you can actually hang out there and TALK to your friends and just have a nice time.\n\nI personally don't care about shots, or cocktails or all that junk.  Beer will always be my personal preference when I go out to drink, Vesuvio provides just that, a good place where I can get a pitcher of beer instead of a fruity martini or shot of Patron.  In my opinion, why pay almost 10 dollars for a small shot and get drunk within the first 5 minutes when you can talk to friends, have some fun, drink some BEER.  Good times.\n\nThe interior design is freakin' awesome, two story decor made to look similarly to an Irish pub.

I have been here once before and had a great time and the following experience saddens me.  Tonight, I attended a birthday party for a server who works with my partner.  We were a group of 10, all servers and bartenders.  We had come from the stinking rose, where we had an amazing dining experience.  As we received drinks, the cocktail waitress mentioned that her shift was ending and that she would need to be paid now because she \"didn't want to miss out on a 15 dollar tip\" and that the tip would be included in the price.  We were all fine with that, of course, but I felt really uncomfortable when she talked like that to us, almost embarassed.  We were there for a birthday party, and everyone was in a good mood and just wanted to have a good time.  We are all in the industry and would have left this woman a great tip if she had explained that she were about to be off work and that she'd like to transfer us to another server, but that is not what went down.  When we tried to add drinks to the tab, she looked really irritated and talked with us about tips 2 other times.  Even saying the word tip to a customer is APPALLING to me, and the cherry on top was the security guard who came upstairs and asked us to be quiet.  We were going around in a circle telling the birthday girl things we each liked about her, and then cheersing when each one of us was done talking.  I was with 2 guys and 7 girls, of course it's going to get a little loud.  At my bar i worry about people being intoxicated, falling asleep, etc, not groups of servers/bartenders who put up with peoples crap all the time, and only want to celebrate a birthday and buy lots of alcohol from your establishment.  I went outside to smoke a cigarette (by this time my friends were chugging the wine because we just wanted to leave) and apologized to the door guy for being loud, and explained to him we were all in the industry and were celebrating a birthday blah blah, and then he replied \"we try to keep it low key, i know it looks like a dump but.......\" and i said 'actually it doesn't', I was being honest, the bar doesn't look like a dump at all, but the cocktail server I had tonight does make it look like a dump, as does the security guard who was on his iphone while doing the door.  Totally unacceptable and unprofessional.  I give one star for the guy in the green cap who was free pouring drinks with amazing accuracy, I was watching him to keep myself calm throughout the onslaught of tips badgering I got from that awful cocktail waitress.  I will not return to this business, there are so many other bars with awesome elite cocktail servers that I'd rather give my money to when my group of industry professionals wants to go out.

Over and down in a sleepy town... \n\n....\n....\n\nWe meet at Vesuvio's.  She's married and I'm broke.  I'm great to be around she says.  A football game is on the TV over the bar and we both stare at it intensely.  (I couldn't tell you the teams that were playing but I could tell you about the striped shirt she was wearing and how cute her arms were folded over the table, excited eyes ablaze in a cold beer buzz.)  Her laugh a comfort to my soul like no one else's - The only way I know how to connect with her in my nervousness is making her laugh, drinking Lagunita's IPA. Her husband is trying to reach her.  He wants to drink a beer, too. With her.   \n\nSomething very comfortable about the time spent inside this bar.  Mellow lamps and Kerouac on the wall.  Beat poets are here, before happy hour, writing it down with tightly crossed legs, wrenching out the woes and whatnot.  I fall into the warmth of Vesuvio's, wishing there was no ending to this day.  Tonight is coming too fast and I can only hope ordering two more beers will do the trick.  She makes her empty beer bottle kiss my empty beer bottle.  Before the waitress comes by again, the bottles are in a frenzy - banging against each other.  The bottle caps on the table spill to the floor like socks on a dark bedroom floor - Uncontrolled laughs spring from our sideways heads.  We order two more and tell the waitress, \"Please don't take away the empties.  It's proof we've been here awhile.\"  \n\nI find my eyes on the TV once more as some kind of tension returns to our table.  The girl's eyes scan my face.  I look at her, weakening.  Our smiles fading for the moment.  I know the truth, but I don't need it right now.  She wants to be honest.  She wants to know what's on my mind. She's been on my mind but I don't want to lay something that heavy on her.  \n\n....\n\nEnough about the girl.  I didn't get the girl.  I got the bar.  All to myself.  Legs tightly crossed, scribbling loosely on a postcard.  The rain coming down in sheets, now.  She and I once ran through the rain, smiling - Not caring about anything or anyone.  She and I connected forever in a single moment - Wishing to stop time - Knowing that we had to quit it all after awhile.  We ran into this bar and found a table where I found love in her smile.  She said that she hadn't seen that hungry look in a man's eyes in a long time.  She told me she would never forget this night.  (Yes, night had arrived.  The Transamerica Beacon was blinking to remind some of us it was time to go home.)\n\n....\n....\n\n\nI will never forget that night.  I found love for a girl.  For a city.  I am writing these kind of things on the postcard and become concerned with typicalities - Those lovely cliches that ungracefully grace postcards of this sentiment - Like it matters at this point.  I send it off to her anyway.  I still owe you twenty bucks and a couple beers, I tell her.  \n\nBut she's in that Marin town - Betting on the sure thing - Loving life and the way the sun shines and the way you can see Mt. Tamalpais all the time.  \n\nI'm still here.  In Vesuvio's.  I came in from the rain.", "author": "Kenny R."}

We were a very normal group of six locals without any attitude or bad behavior and got very abused by the staff for reasons unknown.\r\n\r\nThe waitress was the rudest I have ever come across in some 20 years of going to bars in San Francisco and the bartender was another piece of work with a bad attitude.  A simple request to salt the rim of a glass (as originally ordered) on a second round of $52 in drinks (this brought our total to $104 with them) was met with a sneer by the waitress who said, \"It IS salted\" and left us but not before spilling some of one drink onto a friend's coat without so much as an apology or a clean up.  The coat now has to be dry cleaned and the spill was clearly intentional on her part.  \r\n\r\nThe person in our party who made the request for the salted glass went to the bartender to get it corrected and he was rude as well.  The waitress then glared at us everytime from then on. She never asked if we wanted anything else and obviously didn't want us there from the time we walked in.  When we left, another in our party told the bartender how we felt and he was just as rude.  The bartender denies what his unbelievably obnoxious reply was, but he is the only one taking that position.\r\n\r\nI used to go to Vesuvio's but never will again and I have never had problems like this before anyplace else in the city.

This girl obviously didn't want to serve us, so we had to flag her down or stop her on her way to somewhere else to get our drinks for us. It probably took less than 10 seconds to order our drinks overall, but during the ordering process, she gave us this b***** attitude and told us that there is a 10$ minimum for credit card and when my friend and I asked each other what else to order to fill up the minimum, she interrupted and said \"ok, this is really heavy\"(referring to the drinks she had in her hand for another table). It took literally less than 10 seconds to say, \"we would like this\", \"there is a 10 dollar minimum\", (we look at each other), \"ok, this is really heavy\", \"we'll add one more beer\". she comes back with the receipt, says absolutely nothing, slides it over by the edge of the table, then throws the pen on the table with the dirtiest attitude I have ever seen from a server. I was pretty pissed. I came home and got on Yelp to see if others had similar experiences. Sure enough there are several complaints on here about the same server chick. Seems like others went as far as to complain to the bartender and the manager, only to have gotten another slap on the face. I guess I'm glad I kept my cool and didn't bother complaining to the manager cause I would have definitely thrown a crap show. Obviously, this place is popular so she must not be rude to everyone that goes there. As a matter of fact, she was very friendly to the table next to us. I don't know what made this psycho want to be rude to us, but if I were you, I would not take the chance to see if she likes you or not. stay away from this place.", "author": "James C."}

We have great wine just over the bridge, great craft ales and beers brewed within the city limits, many choices of other speciality alcohol (gin, vodka, etc) and a cold damp fog that persists for most of the year, which in my mind further necessitates the need for a spirit to lift your mood and warm your face and belly. Lately, I've been in my own mental funky fog. I've been brooding over stuff like Lent and work and tattoos and meaning and other assorted crap. I need to go and straighten the swarm out in a place I will refer to as a \"Think and Drink\". Vesuvio's in North Beach fits this description nicely. \n\nA San Francisco landmark that a legend in its own time. It sparks on the instant nostalgia simliar to that of cable cars, Golden Gate park via the Haight, the Golden Gate bridge without assuming a level of pretentiousness you'd almost expect this bar to have. It's both a solo day drinkers bar and a tourist destination for those seeking out what once was a hub of the beat movement (or a place to take out of towners where drinking is a main attraction!)\n\nJust so you know (in case you didn't get the point from other reviews) this is SO not a place to pick up on people. It's too kick back to try. You can't help but chill and get absorbed by a comfy atmosphere to your own inner happy Zen drinking space (as opposed to the party my ass off drinking space). If you've never done this at a bar, this is a good place to practice. The views from the second floor are perfect for absently gazing while your thoughts and the alcohol take over.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-11-22", "description": "I usually love this place. It's a true San Francisco jem of a saloon. Neat atmosphere, sweet ass upstairs seating, decently priced beverages... \nWhen friends and I are in North Beach and looking for a place to go, I suggest Vesuvio.\nMy last experience with Vesuvio though, a near train wreck. If it wasn't for my friends and I's extreme patience and willingness to deal with a crappy waitress, we would have made a scene. \nWe got to Vesuvio early on a Saturday night. There were about 3 tables open upstairs, and we snatched one. We sat there about ten minutes. We saw the waitress come upstairs, go to a table, get their order, and go back downstairs to place the order. Is it really that hard to do a whole round of the floor, see what everyone wants, and get us all at the same time. Top capacity up here is like 20, lady!\nAnyway, a booth cleared out and we, of course, snatched that in place of the small round table. It was another 10 minutes or so before the waitress finally made her way to the back side of the upstairs to get our drinks. \n1 rum and coke\n1 Jameson straight\n1 IPA\nShe takes our order, leaves, comes back about 5 minutes later with our beverages, we pay in cash, and we're happy.\nThen, a group of about 8 older gentlemen walk in. Now let me tell you something about Vesuvio, if you've never been there, it's not a place for groups of more than 4..ever. But, in an attempt to make money, the waitress pushed together the 3 available tables, and sat the whole group together. What she didn't think about, is that she pushed the tables together right in front of our booth making it impossible for us to get in and our of our booth without requiring at least 4 people to stand up, move their chairs and tables, and let us squeeze through. \nNot only was it not effective when your bladder said \"I'm full!!\", but the waitress was now also unable to give us ANY decent customer service. She was now having to ask the men at the table to ask us if we needed a drink. We ordered with the old guy, he told the dumb waitress. This went on for about 30 more minutes until i finally said 'no more'.\nAs I attempted to squeeze out of my booth asking the large group to, once again, all move out of the way for one of us to get out, I kindly suggested that they move their table grouping about a foot off the ledge of the balcony. Not only would this open up a walk way to allow us in and out of our booth, it would allow the waitress a walkway, and wouldn't be blocking any other tables from leaving which is a HUGE fire hazard. I thought it was a fine solution. \nUnderstandably, at this point, the table was irritated with us. I'm sorry I'm a smoker dude, and I'm sorry that the idiot waitress has no brain, but don't get mad at me!\nThe one man, presumably head of the table, looked at me after making my suggestion and said \"what are you, a high school graduate?\". \"Excuse me, sir\", I replied, \"Are you trying to insult me!?\". \nAs you can imagine, a few words were exchanged between me and this other irritated patron. It ended with me reminding him that insulting a young woman in front of his 7 fellow adult male friends was a sure fine way of making him look like a jackass. He apologized, I accepted it, and they moved their effing table, like I suggested. \nFinally, we could breath again.\nAbout 15 minutes later, after our drinks had been empty for over 20, the pea-brained waitress comes back to see how we're doing. I kindly express to her the frustration we've had being locked into the booth by a group of older men who clearly were irritated every time one of us had to use the bathroom. I showed her that had it been thought out, there was room to sit the group without blocking any surrounding tables. I  advised her that due to fire safety standards, there are times in which a small bar may need to turn down a large group it does not have the capacity for, and lastly, i expressed to her my utter disappointment with her customer service (ordering beer thru another patron, REALLY!?).\nThe waitress was clear that she didn't give a crap about how she had made us feel. She said with a clear sarcastic 'I don't even care about you' voice, \"I can see that you're not happy, is there anything I can do?\". I told her I didn't want anything from her but our bill, and the hope that next time she has a group come in that she wouldn't block the patrons at the booth and ruin their experience at Vesuvio the way she ruined ours.\nShe looked at me, rolled her eyes, and said \"I'll just cover your last round, is that good enough?\"\nI told her that was fine, and my friends and I left. \nCan I say I'll never go back? No. Vesuvio doesn't deserve to get a bad reputation from one crappy waitress...but I'll surely walk out, down Jack Kerouac Alley, and over to the Buddha Bar next time I see her coming toward my table.", "author": "Sarah J."}

I'll never forget the first time my roommate and I visited the bar.\n\nWe were both in our Jack Kerouac \"On the Road\" mode, and just decided to soak in all the residual \"Beat\" energy in North Beach.  No sooner do we step in, after being carded and having to wait for a few people to step out of the bar, do we head to the bar and see Lawrence Ferlinghetti himself, sitting alone at the corner of the bar!  Incredible experience.  He was absolutely red-faced and didn't look like he was up for much socializing, so we placed our order, hung out downstairs for a bit, trying to look like we weren't staring;  \n\nAs soon as our fanaticism faded (it was a good hour or so), we headed upstairs and finally found a seat - we still had drinks in hand, but I guess one of the obligations of the privileged few who find a great seat overlooking the surrounding streets is that you can't not order anything from an eager server dying to get you another drink for a fabulous tip!  We just kept those drinks coming and the whole experience was more lucid.\n\nSoon, there was a packed crowd, everywhere, with barely any walking room at all and a live band set up downstairs.  Ferlinghetti had disappeared so we did the only logical thing there was to do in that situation - we promptly headed over to neighboring City Lights bookstore to see if he was there!  He wasn't  - so we headed back to Vesuvio's...  Seeing him there was enough to make it a positively wonderful memorable experience.  We've visited Vesuvio's many times since.", "author": "Olma M."}

We grabbed some mixed drinks and beers and immediately headed upstairs. The chairs/tables were under windows along one side that opened to Columbus Ave and the blinking lights of one of the coolest intersections in San Francisco. The drinks were good, the people were good, and this was definitely not some tourist trap like places around here. I will go back here every time I come to San Francisco from now on.", "author": "Devon A."}

Sit downstairs if it's not too crowded, or up if it it's a date. Just beware that while the bartenders are generally pleasant and efficient, waitresses tend to be on the dumber side of the spectrum. \n\nThe truly best part about this place is location - steps from the Citylights bookstore and in the middle of the hodge-podge of North Beach.

My friend Meghan K. (dressed in identical fashion) and I had departed in a hurry from a costumed charity event in order to chase our (even drunker) friend across the city.  This chick was in no position to be wandering by herself in a toga through the perilous late-night streets of North Beach, and so it was that Meghan and I ended up in a taxi headed to Columbus and Broadway in order to find her. However, when drunky drunk refused to answer her phone and then hung up on us (the nerve!!), we decided we had had fulfilled our good-friend obligations to the best of our abilities and certainly deserved a beer for all our efforts.\n\nAnd that is how we found ourselves standing at the bar at Vesuvio clutching our ivory robes (er, sheets) to our bodices and trying to act like we fit right in.  And to be honest, I doubt I've ever received better treatment at a bar in my entire life. Within five minutes, we each had a long island in front of us, purchased by a  friendly (though not even sketchy) dude at the bar, and surrounded by thoroughly enjoyable company.\n\nIt turns out that few things break the ice as effortlessly as a tight toga in a crowded bar. It was almost enough to make us forget about our dear drunk friend, who at that very moment was sitting outside my doorstep in Russian Hill in a drunken stupor and awaiting our return. \n\nFour stars for great location, good vibe, and good service even to the oddballs.

When I got home I called the bar and spoke with Jack, who said they would let me know if they found it.\nYesterday afternoon I called to see if they had had any luck. Talked with Mike who told me that yes, indeed, they had it and I could come get it whenever. Yes! Awesome!

Made our whole night (and even the puking the next day) so much more enjoyable!\n\n2. One of the few bars downtown that has Red Bull.  Maybe there are others, but my favorite drink in the whole world- a Pat Swayze- requires the use of it.  And lots of folks in the FiDi lately have been tellin' me no- and not very nicely- they don't have the sweet nectar I need for my cirrhosis to keep churning.  Thanks Vesuvio, for keepin' it real.\n\n3. The coolest alleyway mural around!  Sit upstairs overlooking it and you will find something new in the painting every time.  \n\n4. Adjacent fabulous bookstore.  If drinking makes you want to read, you're in luck cause City Lights is right next door.\n\nPlus, it's a great place to vent about your workday but private enough that you don't have to listen to the people next to you bitch about theirs.\nAmen to that!", "author": "Lea N."}

Great place to meet for a date before dinner or with girlfriends.  I don't come here often because the drinks are just so-so, the bartenders are not very consistent and I find the cocktails are a bit watered down (the last time I was there I had a vodka gimlet and am still wondering if he put any vodka in it- yep, sometimes they are that bad).

Just giving you a warning.\n\nI'm not really big on modern clubs and \"bars.\" I find I generally go to places that draw a good crowd, but also allow for sitting to enjoy drinks and have good conversation. That's the kind of atmosphere you'll find at Vesuvio. It's a popular destination, for both locals and tourists. The drinks are pretty good as well. Aside from beer and wine, I've tried the Kerouac drink (that probably surprises nobody). It's rum, tequila, cranberry and orange juice with a slice of lime. It is a fantastic drink- it doesn't taste too strong but it packs a punch. I would definitely recommend ordering it if you happen to be there. After my first time having it, I found myself saying \"this is the best drink I've ever had\" and my friend agreed.\n\nBut, aside from the good drinks and atmosphere, it's also a literary and historical landmark. You can drink in a bar that hosted some of the most famous and celebrated authors of the 20th Century. I don't think a lot of people realize that. This isn't just a bar, or a popular bar, but a piece of history. It's worth at least one visit, so you can say you did. Plus, you can pay a visit to City Lights either before or after and leave with an armful of books as well.", "author": "Tom B."}

Expect to be five rounds in before he even considers buying you a drink. (Not that this is the worst characteristic a bartender could possess - he is fairly attentive, mixes a decent drink, isn't big on idle chit chat and even penned his own \"how to treat your bartender\" book.)\n\nLadies room is upstairs, guys downstairs.

Depending on the night, you can also catch a number of artist types--always a good conversation to be had.\n\nAnother major selling point for Vesuvio--besides itsbeatnik tradition and lore--is its 6am opening time 7 days a week.  Dave is usually the man who will be handling your drinking needs.  He is always up for  a good chat and more than accommodating.  You get all kinds at that hour (google \"90 Proof Breakfast\"  for more info), but it is generally peaceful and laid back .  \n\nIf you are looking to escape the madness of the Broadway/Columbus scene when in North beach, check out Vesuvio (and Specs across the street).", "author": "Socrates M."}

It was recommended by a lady we met on the plane ride to SF who was really cool and helpful. Anyway, we walked in...the place had a lot of character and charm. It had a Cheers-like feel to it. (Sometimes you wanna go where everybody knows your name). It was pretty full with all sorts of people. Surprising on a Thursday night. The bartender was really cool. My friend wasn't feeling well so he even gave her green tea. Dude...green tea at a bar?? Who does that?? Haha. He was really nice. After the whole green tea thing...I spilled my Henney and coke all over the bar...NICE~! He made me a new one with a smile. We sat at the bar for about an hour and a half...had many many Henney and cokes, Vodka tonics and Pear ciders. The bartender came by with complimentary shots of Jager. Not the best mix in my tummy but thank you Mr. Bartender man for welcoming us to SF~!! \n\n***Oh, oh , oh~!! I realized that the drinks are dirt cheap here!!***", "author": "Caroline Y."}

They mix the classics well, have some decent microbrews, and interesting specialty drinks (bohemian coffee and the jack kerouac).  This place is too good for it's own good but while this place draws a trendier crowd on weekend nights, this is still a great place to go off-peak (as early as 6 am).  The second floor is a perfect spot for a date if you can get a table, while the bar area draws a very mixed crowd eager for conversation- an \"I'm from Texas!\" type sitting next to a bohemian reading a book and casting dirty looks anytime anyone talks too loud.", "author": "Rob R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-09-14", "description": "went to meet friends and i thought the decor/atmosphere/vibe/chi was lovely. ordered a stella, tipped, sat down to chat. but then shit went sour when i realized my beer was bitter, flat, and not right. stella is a little crisp and bitter, but this was undrinkable. i politely told the bartender the stella tasted weird, and he made some snide remark suggesting that i (a supposed beer newb in the midst of salty crusty old bachelors) just didn't know what stella tastes like. the crusty old bachelors around the bar laughed at his remark. then he poured himself a taste, made a face, and replaced my drink. too late, i already felt like an ass.\n\nshame since i work nearby and will never come back. there are lots of places where i feel like a piece of shit, but dammit i refuse to be treated like anything less than a golden god when i step foot into a place of booze.", "author": "Erica C."}

Get a spot at a table upstairs and stare out the window at the city and the lights. It feels as though you are sat aboard a galleon slowly sinking into Columbus Avenue.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-01-28", "description": "i had a terribly bad stomach ache while we were at this bar.  probably a combination of the previous whiskey drinks, mixed in between patron and jameson's shots, and the chinese food/beer we had right down the street minutes before.  i did vomit a bit in the bathroom, just to clean out the chinese food- and after a recovery period i was back in the game.  unfortunately it was after we had left vesuvio.  but i could see myself really enjoying this place- fun crowd, good beer, good service, and great decor.  i'd like to return during my next SF visit- and this time i'll wait to have chinese food after the bar.", "author": "Sean L."}

It's in a great location, good place to start off the night or end the night, I've done both.

It was packed even for a Wednesday night and the best part is that it is such a diverse crowd of all ages.

Its perfect for solitude or jovial beer drinking. Maybe its the history, maybe its because of its proximity to city lights book store, but you cant help but feel a little literary when you enter this amazingly outfitted bar. The interior design is enough to entertain even the most greedy eyes. I am plotting my next journey to Vesuvio's..readying my journal and my pen...", "author": "robyn k."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-10-19", "description": "one of my favorite hang outs. I typically dont venture here on the weekends as its close proximity to the broadway bridge and tunnel crowd tend to invade this landmark of a bar in North Beach. They seem to leave after realizing its not really a pick up joint. Any other night though, its the best! the 2nd floor seating with the windows to look out of are fun. The staff is always cool, and generally nice.  Very attentive service. The bathrooms are kind of odd but dont let that discourage you. Provides for some table conversation. If you do go on a saturday or friday, the turn around of customers is pretty steady and seats tend to open up every hour or so. At least thats what ive experienced. This place really takes you back in time and its just a cool spot to be for a casual night out.", "author": "Jesse O."}
