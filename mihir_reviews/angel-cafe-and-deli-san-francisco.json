Had the spinach & Feta breakfast wrap which had tons of fresh spinach and just the right amount of feta.  It seems to be a place visited by many locals.  The lady and man who were working knew many of the customers who would walk in and order their drinks and food.  Both employees are nice, although the lady is especially nice.  I think that the gentlemen is nice to locals whose order he knows before they make it, but not as friendly to tourists, although not unfriendly.  \nMenu items consist of things made in house and brought in.  \nIn addition to many breakfast and menu items they also have a full coffee bar.  I just bought a plain coffee which was good, my only complaint would be that their only sweetener is sweet-n-low.  \nIf I were here another day this is definitely the place to which I would return", "author": "Scott A."}

We must have walked 5-6 blocks without any bagel or donut shops, which I thought was odd. Finally on a random corner was this small deli with people sitting all along the sides enjoying cups of coffee during the brisk morning hour. Before I could tell my boyfriend \"let's go\", he was already in the door. I already fixed my eyes on what I wanted so there was no waiting period for me. The menu had a wide variety of things mostly, Mediterranean options, but my heart needed a bagel. \n\nI think the owner helped us out, a super nice guy. I asked him if I can build my own breakfast sandwich and he said \"yup!\"  I got a specialty bagel, with eggs, cream cheese, cheddar cheese, sprouts and avocado, then tacked on an ice coffee.  I was able to find a couple of seats outside while waiting for our order, so that was nice that were weren't forced to walk and eat our bagels. Very quickly our bagels were ready and MAN when I tell you, this bagel was outstanding! It's odd because there was nothing that was over the top about this bagel, but it was just so delicious. I must have inhaled my bagel as fast as it took to make because I looked up and my boyfriend was barely on his first bite. All in all Angel Caf\u00e9 was a great little spot, a little pricy, but a good bagel spot!", "author": "Gabby K."}

My mistake last time was ordering the Lox bagel with the least fresh lox I've ever seen in my life. This time around I thought hey- let's get a breakfast bagel, you can't go wrong with eggs cheese and bacon. But I was wrong. Eggs were a little green and I don't even know how, cheese wasn't even melted and was basically one of those square cheddar pieces you ate as a kid.

The space itself will not inspire extensive Instagram exposes, and that's in part the appeal: It's a normal, solid place that provides relatively cheap, quality food in an increasingly precious, abnormal city. I regularly come here to pick up dolmas ($1 for two) or falafel ($1 each), which make a fine and satisfying breakfast on their own for basically no money. The spanakopita ($5) is a more fulfilling alternative and a worthy upgrade. It's also possible to build a great lunch out of these items plus the various salads without leaving the deli counter. Really the deli counter is the main event and the reason I go back.\n\nThey have the full complement of other coffeeshop choices, though neither the prices nor quality are show stoppers. The coffee is nothing special but adequate and they have a decent array of teas, and they have it ready and hot when you need a cup in a hurry. The bagels do their job. I haven't tried the yogurts though they look decent. In warmer months the outside tables make for a nice place to linger a minute, though the inside is a little cramped for serious coffeeshop lounging.\n\nService is fast and attentive and they make it clear they want my business and will customize orders and make recommendations.

On the outside, Angels Cafe & Deli doesn't look like much - it's got a blue awning and advertises its free WiFi and breakfast foods like pastries, etc. However, when you walk in, you see the hipster chalkboard menu and you're sold. Okay I'm only being half sarcastic - this place is amazing AF. They have a TON of different bagel breakfast sandwiches and it's very typical pricing so nothing to break the bank, but it ain't Mickey D's either. I myself got the Heavenly Breakfast Bagel Sandwich that comes with egg, avocado, red onions, cream cheese, cucumbers, and tomatoes. DELICIOUS. A perfect combination of each element and the avocado and cream cheese work seamlessly together. It's the best bagel breakfast sandwich I've ever had, and I'm from LA.

I used to come here quite a bit but it seems recently they have hired some new faces in the FOH.  I came in on a Saturday afternoon and saw three newbies working behind the counter.  I ordered my usual (everything bagel with hummus, red onion, tomato and cucumber).  The guy who rang me up was a little slow, took him a few minutes to realize what I ordered, then tried to look at the menu to find the price, then took my money (no gloves...where are the gloves, the last guy used to changed his gloves like 6 times while I was in there giving me a nice sense of clean security!) \nI stepped aside and waited patiently for my delicious bagel. There was only one other guest in there eating already so I figured my order would be quick and efficient. I saw the cashier tell the girl working the food line what I ordered and although she looked a bit confused I figured they all had it under control.  A few minutes later, I see her holding up an everything bagel smeared with cream cheese and nodding to the cashier like (this is it, right?) He went over and told her that I ordered hummus and that was cream cheese.  I then saw the other staff member go over and try to just remove the cream cheese with a knife. LIKE JUST SCRAPE IT OFF NO BIG DEAL RIGHT? NOPE - BIG DEAL. I am lactose intolerant. I have really bad reactions to dairy, you know, things like CREAM CHEESE. So I ran over and explained that this wasn't okay (to just try and cover up the mistake) while the woman behind the counter quickly dismissed my concern and explained it wasn't my order.... not my order? There are no other customers in here???\nAgain, I stepped aside as to not hover over the staff messing up my morning bagel.  I quickly received my bagel sandwich, noticing a bit too quickly for them to possibly have re-toasted a new bagel and this was the one that they just scraped the cream cheese off of.  I took my bagel home and not wanting to risk getting sick just gave it to me fiance for breakfast as I didn't trust they actually made me a new one. \nI understand the employees are new but I think food allergies and dietary restrictions are kinds restaurant 101. Something you should take seriously with customers as to not make someone sick (ie trying to just scrape off your mistake doesn't work too well - remake it, eat the cost).

Everything was flavorful and freshly home made with care.  The food was seriously delicious, and so I kept trying more things.

Nice!\n\nThe macaron was perfect. I don't have words. Just go. Eat one. They're only $1. EAT ALL OF THE MACARONS.\n\nThe atmosphere was nice and very clean. We sat by the window to people watch. The lucky bamboo decor was a nice touch. There is cute outdoor seating, but if you don't want to deal with the noise of the city, while still being able to watch all of the activity, I recommend the window seats.\n\nThe service was great, too.

Maybe some books and magazines. Twinkly string lights! The space could be a bit cozier, but I do love the plants. That's just from my completely unsolicited idea bank. They may like the clean and sparse decor look.", "author": "Super L."}

Tall dark wooden stools and tables dominate the outer L shaped area while the warmly lit display shelves and coffee counter hold their rank against the other side.  Helpful and cheery staff (they know their regulars, right down from the senior locals to the men working across the street on repairs) and a great selection of desserts and baked goods.  I opted for black coffee (small) and a yummy sweet looking square of Baklava.  For the insane total of $3.75.  He gave me a discount on the sweet confection!\n\nCoffee is strong and bold, as it should be and paired with the Baklava, perfect to balance out the intense sweetness from the rose flavoured syrup and soaked sheets of phyllo.\n\nAn older gentleman commented on my book and told me that it was uncommon for him to see someone reading Solzhenitsyn.  He nodded his approval when I showed him the cover.\n\nI miss this.\n\nI miss the random comments from total strangers who attempt to take their time in breaking the silence.  I appreciate hearing about their thoughts.  This one left a smile on my face.\n\nAnd set the tone for the rest of the day.\n\nOnce my coffee cooled, I hurriedly gathered my belongings and ran back out into the slight showers.", "author": "Miika M."}

That was all the cash I had and I was in desperate need for my morning fix! It was either that or 200 pennies which they frown upon as well but I didnt want to give you laundry quarters!

I don't know why. I pass it every day and think that I need to go in and try it, but never seem to get around to it. It wasn't until we had guests go and fetch us muffins and vanilla lattes on Monday that I gave this place a try, and I am SO glad I did. \n\nThe muffins and coffee were both delicious, though the coffee especially. It's seriously some of the best I've had in a long time, and I'm pretty picky when it comes to coffee. I don't know what coffee voodoo magic they're working in this place, but it's spectacular. \n\nWhen I went in today, the woman behind the counter was kind yet to-the-point. I actually really liked her personality. She called out a greeting to me as soon as I came in, then came over and stood patiently as I decided what I wanted. I finally settled on a dirty chai and a piece of toasted almond cake from the pastry case. \n\n\"Do you want one shots or two?\" She asked, calm but slightly stern. \n\n\"Hmmm, let's go for two.\" \n\nThen she gave me the most wonderful impressed-raised-eyebrow-and-approving head-nod duo that I have ever seen. Sort of pursed her lips as she did it. It's hard to recreate in words, but it totally made me laugh.  \n\nShe was fast, efficient, and friendly while she made my drink and retrieved my pastry. I only had my card, and offered to get cash from their ATM, but she told me that she would just charge the 50 cents extra for running the card since it's cheaper than ATM fees. When I checked out, though, she knocked off 25 cents to make it an even dollar amount. A nice little gesture. \n\nShe then asked if I lived around here, then gave me a loyalty stamp card. 9 stamps gets you a free cup of coffee. \n\nI will definitely be back. The dirty chai is truly the best I have ever had, and I've probably had hundreds by now. People aren't kidding when they say that their chai is the best ever. The espresso and chai were perfectly balanced--I often find that chai taste gets drowned out by the intensity of the espresso in dirty chai's, but they marry beautifully in Angel's cup. The toasted almond cake is sitting in my fridge, so I've yet to try it, but it looks lovely. \n\nThey have so many gorgeous pastries and desserts, along with a large array of savory foods, and a GIGANTIC selection of drinks. There's enough here to satisfy anyone and everyone. Highly recommended.", "author": "Ashley-Jayne O."}

Not so much.\n\nI don't make many comparisons to food or food culture (especially since San Diego isn't exactly well known for culinary expertise outside of Mexican cuisine), but if there's one thing I know: it's a good breakfast burrito.\n\nI've never understood why some caf\u00e9s try to be an eater's one-stop-shop. Though I'm sure everything behind the glass counter is tasty, I just don't understand how anyone can master the art of cous cous, falafel wraps, pancakes, Mexican breakfast burritos, various pastries and roughly 7 billion other options. I'm more of a KISS fan (acronym for Keep It Simple Stupid... an old radio term), so I'd rather see a place with fewer offerings done well than a gaggle of food stuffs ranging from great to blah.\n\nI met a few friends here last week for a quick breakfast before hanging out with naked fellows in Delores Park. Being a huge fan of burritos, I opted for their signature breakfast burrito, while my two amigas went with specialty bagels and pastries. Both of their meals were fab, but my order left a lot to be desired.\n\nAgain, not to compare apples to oranges... but who the hell steams burritos on a panini press? I watched them fill my tortilla with eggs, avocado, bacon and some other goodies... then they essentially heated it up on a George Foreman Grill. While I love the lean, mean, grillin' machine... I'm not a fan of warming burritos on them. It's just weird. The taste reflected my suspicions - just way, way off. I ended up only eating a few bites, then nibbling on my friend's plates. Exactly why I think some outfits should just stick to what they do well, as opposed to trying to please everyone.\n\nThe coffee drink I had was spot on, and the staff was really friendly. I'd totally go back another time, but it'll hot day in Antarctica before I order another breakfast burrito.", "author": "Ruggy J."}

I've also have had a pregnant woman craving for Baklavah lol ^.^ This is Sanfrancisco, shouldn't be that hard right?? I came across Angel Cafe. This bright blue corner cafe is really close to where i live. It's definetly family owned, clean, and everyone is so so sweet- customer service spot on with added charm. It gets really busy at lunch and the place is alittle small to keep up with their hustling business. I wasn't the only one getting a Falafel wrap *which was promising* Someone infront of me was getting this sandwhich which was filled to the brim with meats and cheeses. It looked good if i ate that kind off stuff.\n\nThe Falafel was perfect. Filled with vegetables i never expected. Zuccini, cherry tomatoes *you could tell they were locally grown*, thick chunks of cucumbers, onions, some homemade pickled vegetables, afew pieces of broccoli, grape leaves, fresh herbs, and some spicey peppers since i ordered it spicey. The yougurt sauce had good flavour. The hummus had a wonderful light earthyness to it. The wrap was soft, thin, and warm. It wasn't made with refined flour, and had an almost sweetness to it. The falafel itself was huge. I've never had falafels like this, it was not made with abunch of breadcrumbs. It was soft but had a slightly crunchy but not hard outerwhell. They were huge and filled throughout the whole wrap. It was wrapped tightly so everything was kept in place *which most wraps never are* so it was easier to eat, it was wrappy in parchment paper and then again in foil to keep it warm and in place. This is by far the best falafel i have literally ever fricken had. \n\nI have never had Baklavah that tasted this traditional either. It was good. The portion seemed small until i took it home and saw how thick it really was. Perfect portion.\n\nI paid $10 even for a falafel wrap and piece of Baklavah. It seemed over priced to me until i went home and really looked at what i ordered. The falafel wrap was HUGE. I couldn't really finish it but i did just because it was that awesome. It essentially is the same price as Ayola, but the wrap its like 1/3xs bigger. Plus Ayola is alot of bread and lettuce, Angels is little bread but tons of fresh local vegetables and huge falafels with just the right amount of sauces. The Baklavah was really good as well. The flavours was spot on. They have a pretty exclusive menu with alot of coffees, sandwiches, traditional greek foods with some pastries. \n\nI figured if i could not get traditional good greek food at a family owned/run traditional cafe, then there was no hope for good decent priced mediteranian in frisco- this place did not disapoint. This place is AMAZING. Run with smiles and love. Everything is homemade and fresh. You can tell they are happy and love what they do. The area really isn't that bad. If you think this is in a bad area in SF u have no idea lol. The area is fine. Any area you can still text in without risk is not a bad area lol. \n\nSo impressed, i look forward to coming here in the future to trying other things, however the Falafel is beyond perfect so it's hard 4 me 2 imagine getting something else.", "author": "Brittainie B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-10-28", "description": "ANGEL IS THE SHIT!\n\nseriously best cafe in town, and let me fucking tell you 5 reasons why.\n\n1. The Family- Angel is clearly a family run operation and that is awesome. Not  a bunch of punk ass hipsters scoffing at you behind their coke bottle glasses. The son who pretty much runs the show there is the shit; always in a good mood, willing to accomodate any need you may have. The pops, is the true boss though. Wandering around, meeting and greeting the patrons, treating you like one of his own, which can be somewhat awkward at times, but is nice and makes you feel welcome. The sister? who makes all the food, does so with care and consideration you aint gonna find anywhere else.\n\n2. Internet- at Angel its free, no janky need to pay to get a code bullshit like other places. They let you in and let you on the interwebs. nough said. \n\n3. The atmosphere- you want a place to chill out in the sun and relax, Angel has you covered. The outdoor sitting is relaxed and framed by white  fences, your on the seat but in your own space. This part of town is also warm and lacking the sometimes obnoxious SF gale force winds, so you can actually sit outside and not feel like a shcmuck with your hair blowing all over the place. AND if you wanna get some actual work done! Angel has you covered too. Their \"cave\" in the downstairs is the perfect work space. Dim lighting which can be booster in each section, if you personally require more light, and the cozy warm space is perfect for when you need to tuck in and get some shit finished. They even have news running on the T.V. so you can keep up with what the fuck is going on in your world, cause we all know you dont read the news !!!\n\n4. THE FOOD. The food at Angel, is Angelic. They prepare pretty much every dish at this place by hand, you can see the mother in the back slaving away to make all the dishes with ingredients from scratch, I mean cmon! that is fucking epic. And if you want some upscale sweets, they got treats to treat. Mostly a mediterranean cuisine, which is bomb and healthy for you. No transfat in this place people.\n\n5. Utilities. So I mentioned the internet, but did I also mention if your broke ass doesnt have your own PC you can use the ones they have there! Cheap access, and they have a printer, which is even wireless as well! Angel is on the cutting edge of tech, and they got an ATM, and take card as well, none of this cash only bull.\n\nIf you havent been to Angel, do yourself a favor and go, its the perfect spot to work or kick it, and they will always server you with a smile.\n\nAt Angel you get heavenly treatment.", "author": "A B."}

It's nice enough inside and the service was pretty friendly. There was a guy and girl working there and an older gentleman that seemed like a real character. He kept talking to me but I couldn't for the life of me understand what he was saying. \n\nI saw this big phyllo dough thing in the counter; I think it was called an osa, which looked interesting. I asked the girl behind the counter if it was dry and her answer was that it was very good, I took that to mean that it wasn't dry. I ordered it even though I really should have asked a few questions. \n\nI got it and it was very dry and sweet, full of as many golden raisins and nuts as there was rice and lamb. It reminded me of a dish they served at a Middle Eastern place I worked at years ago that was called a perdiplow; the main difference was that the perdiplow came with some sauce. \n\nWhat I got was the exact opposite of what I wanted to eat.

Had never been inside and wasn't familiar with the menu so I was lingering for a bit before I actually made it to the counter.  I had narrowed down my choices to a garden burger or the falafel sandwich when I walked up to the counter.  I asked the older Middle Eastern guy at the register if he recommended one over the other.  He stared at me blankly.  I then repeated myself and rephrased the question - \"What's more popular?  The garden burger or falafel sandwich?\"  Still nothing.  I tried one more time with another version - \"What do you like - the garden burger or the falafel sandwich?\" Blank stare squared.  At this point I could feel my pulse racing and my irritation growing.  Was I asking a rocket science question?  Dude, come on!  \n\nFinally another guy in the back asked me what my question was and I repeated, and he said definitely the falafel sandwich.  So I turned to the man at the register and said, \"ok, can I get a falafel sandwich to go and two dolmas?'\"  That's when I saw a complete turn around and he gave me a big smile and asked me if \"I was Indian?\"  I said yes.  You could've thought we had just reunited after years apart b/c he totally became uber friendly and grinned at me while I paid and looked right in my eyes.  What happened between my asking which was better and stating that I was Indian, I don't know, but regardless I was treated sooo well!  It's still a puzzle!\n\nAnd the sandwich was delicious.

Most of them are nice and aside from an occasional language barrier things run smoothly when you interact with the person behind the counter. That being said, I have had mixed experiences with their food and drinks. The Yerba Mate Latte they advertise in their window is 4.25 and made with a syrup rather than the real thing. It's mostly foam and the espresso tastes oily. I've given the drink a few tries in the hopes that it was a fluke but each time I've been disappointed. The pre made food is old and their sandwiches are just okay. They don't hesitate to mark up their prices though. I live around the corner and stop by here when I'm in a hurry but the cash only policy pared with the less than average food has really turned me off. Again they're nice people but this won't become my go to cafe in my neighborhood unless it drastically changes. \n\n~The owner did reply to my earlier post and even though not much has changed here I'll give them one more star AGAIN for being so nice.

I decided to order the falafel sandwich, and boy am I glad I did. The soft and flaky dough that held my sandwich together was delicate and thin. It hugged the other ingredients together like a burrito. Inside was a mixture of fresh cherry tomatoes, tangy cucumbers, perfectly textured falafel and hummus and spicy yogurt.\n\nI didn't mean to eat so much, but I could hardly tke a break from devouring the tasty sandwich. I didn't even open my can of diet coke until the last two bites. If I had anymore room left, I would order one of the croissants, chocolate tarts ro other baked goods. But I don't and I can't force myself! Next time, for sure.\n\nThe environment makes me feel like I am in another land. An older woman sits outside at the small tables smoking cigarettes while a more than middle-aged man holds a newspaper but watches the passersby. Classical music plays on the stereo creating a very comfortable setting.

You can even make digital photo prints. \n\nAs for the bevies, this caf\u00e9 offers organic fair trade coffee, iced Chais, Italian sodas, fresh carrot and orange juice, hot chocolate and even warm milk with flavor shots.\n\nIf you are in the area and in need of a snack, full meal or shot of caffeine, you should definitely come here.

It seems they need a better system for ordering, expediting and paying for busier times. People order over the counter and at the register and then orders get backed up. An 'Order here' sign could easily solve this problem.", "author": "Danielle W."}

I walked so many blocks, had so many homeless people call me \"baby girl', for this? Don't be fooled by the cheesy exterior though.  It is reasonably classy inside.\n\nThe staff was super friendly and the food is yummy.  I had a grilled sandwich with sprouts, avocado, brie, tomatoes, and pesto.  Any sandwich with pesto totally has me sold. The coffee is good as well, plus it's  fair trade/organic/shade grown or something.\n\nI tried to sit outside, but it was just too cold.

It's on my way to school in the morning, so most days I stop by in the morning for coffee and something to make my stomach happy. \n\nI have yet to have something there that I don't like. The pastries are pretty typical, but they're always well stocked. The bagels are great, my favorite is the hummus bagel... amazing. And the falafel pita... absolutely perfect.\n\nThe coffee's really good too, though I always end up spilling it on myself on my way down the hill. \n\nBut what makes this my favorite cafe are the people who run it. Everyone who works there is amazingly nice. Actually nice, not 'I'm complimenting your bad taste in clothing because I want a good tip' nice. Maybe it's because the owners are almost always working but still... they are always smiling.

This place is the reason I get out of bed in the morning, and the afternoons on days off. The people who work there are so nice and the food is great. They have a large selection of things to eat for such a small place, and you can fax and copy things there, too. My favorite thing to do is sit outside and watch all the different people walk by. Love Love Love this place and you will, too!", "author": "L T."}

But the couple of times I've tried it, the food is just terrible. I can't remember what I ordered the first time several months back, it was something sweet, like tiramisu. I remember it tasting old. I made a mental note not to go back. Well, last night, I've been craving for cheesecake, and I passed by this cafe from the gym. So I decided to give it another try. The cheesecake looked good, and so I bought one slice of NY cheesecake. Surprise, surprise... it tastes like it's been sitting there for days. Anyway, never going back. For $3.50 a slice, I want a fresh slice of cake.", "author": "Ryan M."}
