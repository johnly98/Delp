The people and service is awesome. The seating is cozy but not cramped. Lot of room and privacy to enjoy your meal and talk while being able to hear everyone at your table. \n\nI got the three tacos: pescado, al pastor, carne Asada. The tacos were amazing. Coming from San Diego, I didn't think I'd find tacos this good.  Also got the guac and salsa. Guac is a tradition guac with no frills. The salsas that come with it are a really nice and refreshing salsa verde, a roja that had a Smokey kick.l, and a habanero. The habanero was pretty spicy and had a lot of flavor. The salads are really good here too. You get a massive bowl that has a nice crisp and refreshing flavor of cilantro and a vinaigrette which I couldn't put my finger on. However it was super good. For the food alone, I'd say this is the best Mexican I've had here so far. \n\nNow for the bad part. This place is pretty expensive. Almost $15 for guac and salsa is pretty crazy. It's like one avocado worth of guac. Looking at the menu it kinda looks like guac salsa and chips is 7.25 but it's really 7.25 extra. It's good but maybe not $15 good. Also the black beans are really good but they are $8. I'd say if they cut the price of the sides and salsa in half I'd go there all the time. But for the price, I'd probably only go every few months. With drinks and food, it's easily $100ish for two.", "author": "Mark W."}

The server was very prompt and serving us and asked us what types of drinks he wanted. \n\nWe settled on the pitcher of a margarita which was $42; the pitcher of margaritas is overpriced. The picture itself is smaller. And you can maybe get a cup and a half each. All together that's maybe for glasses and change in total. $10 4 a glass of margaritas which isn't the biggest class anyways is overpriced.\n\nThe food is very good. We got one of the salads to share along with some chips and dip. And each of us got our own tacos. I got the taco with the pork shoulder, I can't remember the name of it and the fire hot dog. The chips and dip is probably where it's at. They give you avocado, and three different types of salsa. The salsa ranges from mild medium to hot. I'm not a huge fan of spicy food, I like it but I'm not in love with it, the spiciest salsa was very hot to me. The hot dog I was expecting to also be very spicy. But it wasn't, surprisingly.\n\nOverall the vibe was a good place to head for some happy hour after work. There isn't an official happy hour at this establishment. Other than the pitcher of margaritas everything else was relatively fair-priced. That was the only bummer of the outing. Otherwise I probably would come back just to hang out with some co-workers.

The fried egg was cooked perfectly with gooey yolky goodness that the waitress warned me to be careful that it might drip after I bite into it. Corn tortillas were house-made and really good.

Ordering was easy, located at the right side of the door. Food was fresh and well executed. Only reason why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the price.

The white yogurt sauce that accompanied them was kind of pointless.

Now, she constantly sends me links to food articles which is how I found about Glena's Tacos & Margaritas. \n\nAfter reading the article, I knew I had to visit Glena's. The chef/owner used to work at Manresa and Kin Khao, both restaurants that I've really enjoyed which was very promising. \n\nUntil they get their liquor license, Glena's is only open Monday - Saturday from 11 am - 3 pm.\n\nBeware: Parking in the area really sucks but you can order to-go and have your passenger run in and grab your order. \n\nIt's a fast casual eatery. Order with the hostess and grab a number, or sit at the bar for full service. It's a tiny space  that fits 20 people so it's not for large groups. \n\nOn the menu are tacos ($5), platos ($12-$16): salads, torta, tostadas, pozole, chips + guacamole ($10), plantains ($6), and churro ($6). Drinks and juices only until they get their liquor license.\n\nTo start, I ordered the Al Pastor Taco ($5): http://bit.ly/2lE9oK5 which was one of the best tacos I've had! I'm not a fan of corn tortillas because they can have the texture of a rubberband but this taco was served on a flour tortilla. The al pastor had deliciously crispy charred edges but was very tender and flavorful. The pineapple added a nice sweetness while the salsa and squeeze of lime gave it a punch of acid. Beautiful layers of flavors and my only regret is not ordering another.\n\nA steaming bowl of Stephy's Pozole ($15) was in order since it was so cold outside: http://bit.ly/2l8usXn. It was served with dried oregano, shredded cabbage, diced onions, lime, and radish so you can doctor it up to your liking. Cubed avocado and tortilla chips were also provided. \n\nThe pork shoulder was lean and tender. The hot broth was perfect for this cold weather but it was really mild for \"spicy\". The housemade tortilla chips provided great texture. The pozole was good but not as good as the ones you can get for $10 at Gallardos (my favorite in SF) and San Jalisco. \n\nI usually judge a Mexican restaurant by the meats they serve, and prefer places that serve offal but Glena's proves that you can serve great quality [organic] Mexican food without dumbing down the flavors.\n\nWith bars like Third Rail, The Sea Star, and Dogpatch Saloon just steps away, Glena's is going to be a popular spot for drunchies once they extend their hours of operation. \n\nThis may be far fetched but I would love to see menudo on the menu one day!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

As soon I departed the plane I checked their address to drive there ASAP since I was statving, and then noticed they are closed between 2-5pm. What??? Why??? Come on!!! Unbelievable...so I skipped my lunch here and made a detour to Dip. I came back after 5pm when they opened and was not disappointed. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. I was still full from lunch and decided to have a drink at the bar and order to-go food for dinner to enjoy in my hotel room. The Spicy margarita was delicious at $12 and the Al Pastor taco had marinated cubed pork, instead of the traditional boneless pork shoulder sliced super thin ($5). The show stoppers were the salsas I ordered with chips and guacamole. I've tried numerous salsas from here to Mexico and I must say the three salsas included with the chips are by far some of the most delicious I've ever had.

I love this neighbourhood, perfect to explore some of the new places that have come up on a weekend afternoon. Small place, owner used to work at Kin Khao before. We were a party of 3, and Vegetarians. There is only one taco, one salad and a couple of sides to choose from for vegetarians. We pretty much ordered all of them. The plantain chips was great. This is slightly different from ones you would normally get in other Mexican places. These ones are cubes of ripe plantains fried and garnished with spices. Best part is if you get me my food piping hot, I m already sold, and yes this is a dish that comes that way. INSIDER TIP: ask for the Chilli lime salt and sprinkle some of that on this. Game changer. \n\nThe guac although creamy was lacking in flavour (it was just very well mashed avocado). You can avoid it. Or if you choose to get it, flavour it up with the Chilli lime salt.\n\nThe Salad: Good thing was they can split the salad in two bowls, works great if you want to share your salad. The portion is quite big. The vegetables were fresh and crisp, however the pickled onions made it too sour and was overpowering. I would avoid this too\n\nTacos: The tofu taco was yum. You could distinctly taste each flavour.  The texture of the tofu was perfect, chewy enough, not too dry and not too moist that it crumbles. \n\nWould come back to get the plantain chips and the tacos.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-06-11", "description": "I saw all the great reviews and ran all the way here from ferry building (literally) excited to feast on tacos at the finish line. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I had the trio of tacos that they group together on the menu. Listed in my order of preference, it was the pescado, al pastor, and carne asada. Pescado is the only taco I'll ever order again. Al pastor was ok, but quite bland. Carne asada was bland and the meat was tough to chew, so the texture made it last place for me. There is way too much tortilla for the amount of meat on the taco. The hot sauce they provide was a saving factor. For $5 tacos, I expected better. Maybe the good reviews here are for the drinks.", "author": "Katherine Y."}

Tonight I was with a friend and we thought we'd eat at the counter (actually I was going to have a couple tacos and he a Margarita) but I ended up walking out because I was treated so badly, something I have never done in my life in any restaurant.   It started when we walked thru the door, no one greeted us and after patiently waiting quite some time we started to ask a passing waiter if we were to just take a seat or wait for someone and were told to wait.   The couple in front of us in the line looked like they were already frustrated and left.\nFinally a young women came to ask us the usual, how many people, and if we preferred a table or a counter.  I said I was just wanting a quick Taco and would be happy to sit at the counter.   By now there were 3 empty places to sit and we were still standing.  She cleared the counter for us but left us standing there.  We couldn't figure out why so I went to ask her.  She seemed annoyed and said the table was not ready because she had to wipe it down.  Another 5 min or so passed and I was running out of time because I had to teach a class in about 30 min.  So I want to say I'd like to place my order to go since I was short on time.  She told me it would take just as long because the kitchen was very busy.  I didn't say I expected it sooner I just wanted to take it to go so I would not be late for my class.   I told her that was fine and she started to walk away and I had to quickly ask for a menu before she was gone.  She gave me one with a bit of an attitude and when she returned just a couple minutes later I started to give her my order when she cut me off and told me the kitchen was too busy and was not doing orders to go.  She did not apologize and left me feeling like a totally unwanted customer.   I will say that the place was very busy but that is NO excuse for treating customers without respect.   \n\nI am very disappointed to see a small business like that move into my neighborhood (I have lived her for 23 years), one that I would really like to support and see thrive, only to find that they treat their customers in this way.\n\nBy the way, this is the first negative review of a restaurant I have ever posted.

I really enjoyed my dinner here, though I have some constructive criticism - hence the 4 and not 5 star rating.\n\nThe space is really cool.  If you've been to Media Noche, this reminded me a lot of it - not in any super specific ways, just the vibe....like a modern, U.S., hipster interpretation of the culture the restaurant embodies.  It's cool - nothing offensive.  Very sleek but kind of cozy, too.\n\nThe staff was really friendly and service was fast.  Ordering is in the format of Barzotto and Media Noche.....order, get a number on a post, have your food delivered to your table.\n\nWe went around 9pm on a Saturday and were served super quickly....like, within 5 minutes of ordering.  Thankfully, they did pace things out.  Chips and dips for a while, then mains and sides when we'd gotten through most of the chips.  We were one of two tables there when we first arrived, but 4-5 more groups came in shortly thereafter.  They must do a normal dinner and then get a post-bar-crowd later...\n\nI really enjoyed the food and drinks, with two exceptions that I'll note.  The chips and salsa are awesome.  And the chips are, like, out-of-this-world good.  Housemade, piping hot, perfectly salty.  They are so airy and crisp, I told my boyfriend that they're the tortilla chip version of a stellar Parisian croissant.  They even refilled our basket after we devoured them!  The salsas were also really good - it's a trio of three, and even the habanero option was flavorful...not just blisteringly hot.  The guac, however, was a let down.  It's really just cubed avocado.  Maybe that's more authentic - I really don't know - but it's nearly impossible to scoop it up with the chips....we kind of had to mash it ourselves at the table.  I also missed it having onion and/or tomato, though I have heard that making it without IS more authentic.\n\nFor entrees, I had fish and Al Pastor tacos and my boyfriend had the torta.  We really liked both.  I was especially surprised at how much I liked my fish taco since the fish is grilled, not fried...and I usually prefer fried.  I liked that the tortillas weren't super heavy, though the corn tortilla was better than the flour tortilla.  I did not like, however, the side of Rancho Gordo beans that we ordered.  My boyfriend was actually really into them, but I thought they were sorely lacking in salt or any other seasoning.\n\nFor drinks, we both had Topo Chico - yay! - and I also had a tasty paloma (they have their liquor license now).\n\nOverall, a cool new spot that I can definitely see myself returning to.", "author": "Tay H."}

Heard alot about this small taco eatery. I'm sure they are still working out the kinks of a new business. Main obstacle I noticed was their price point. There are many, many Mexican eateries in San Francisco. Its imperative to deliver top food and service to survive in this day and age. Their service was on point, but as I indicated, their prices are high. Mind you, I don't object at all to paying more $ for above standard meals as long as the food is elevated and spectacular. I think Glena's fell a tad short.\n\nWe had the Fish and huevo tacos, plantains, and guacamole/salsa and chips. The tacos were great. I really enjoyed their house made corn tortillas (my favorite is always corn!). The Huevo taco was very unique and yummy. The plantains were good but I've had better. The guacamole I thought fell short. It was just cubed avocado but I couldn't taste anything else in it, and it was in the small size. $12.00??  Again, ouch on the wallet! The margarita was great but....too much ice. \n\nI don't usually eat much.

I refuse to pay that price for chips and salsa. I don't need the guac or the array of salsas, just a few chips and one good salsa to whet my appetite and round out my meal.

I really liked the colorful, tangy pop of flavor on the al pastor from the pineapple & salsa verde. The portions for a single taco were generous. Although this place is not as cheap as other taquerias, it's relatively affordable for SF these days - especially for fresh, quality ingredients (including organic meats). It's a focused menu, but has enough variety to be a frequent go-to option. I'll definitely be back to try some of the platos. \n\nAs for service, the owners (of Kin Khao/Manresa and Plow fame) were friendly and welcoming. The space is small but warm and inviting. You order/pay right away when you walk in, and they bring the food out to your table via order number.

They really do need to look at offering a \"house margarita\" option that's less than the $12 options they currently have.  The margaritas are tiny (but good) and I'd order two if they had like an $8 option.  Service has been great and pretty friendly most of the times I've been here.

And I can't believe I'm actually writing this after only two visits to this little spot in Dogpatch (Dogpatch!?), Glena's is the best. It's the best for three simple reasons: 1. I've been on a search for the best Al Pastor in SF for four years, and now my search has ended; 2. The Carne Asada tacos have to be laced with nicotine as my heart whimpered when I took my last bite and I felt a craving for more even though I was full; 3. Most importantly the UNBELIEVABLE TORTA. Get. In. My. Belly. Twice. Honestly it was so dang good I couldn't believe it. I gave bites to the folks I was with and they confirmed my feeling. That fried chicken. That acme roll. You are a super model of deliciousness. So. If I had to give one critique it'd be this: I'm a massive fan of Salsa. I Love Salsa. And most of all. I'm obsessed with habanero Salsa.

Also there tofu tacos are insanely good!", "author": "Selby C."}

I have already eaten there five times, and gotten takeout once.  DELICIOUS!  I love the torta, the chips are the best I have ever eaten (made fresh, right there), the tacos are fantastic.  They don't have their liquor license yet (just a few more days), but given how good the limeade is, I imagine the margaritas will be incredible.  They are super friendly and helpful.  And quick!  Everyone in my family gives Glena's five stars!", "author": "Dawn J."}

Carne asada taco was cold and the \"soft\" tortilla was stiff. Staff didn't really seem to care when I pointed it out. When you pay $20 for one taco, a side of beans, and a drink, it should be really good. Next time I'll just go to Tacolicious.", "author": "Chris B."}
