She'd had a good experience here a few years ago. (My mom is vegan and I'm vegetarian.) First impression was positive: bright, clean, nicely decorated interior, with a neat array of small tables. We seated ourselves and were given tea and menus immediately. \n\nMy mom and I were both looking for something healthy and refreshing, so we ordered steamed vegetable dumplings, small vegetable and tofu soup, and pea sprouts with ginger. My favorite was by far the dumplings; perfectly cooked, bite size, filling tasted fresh and bright. The soup and pea sprouts were both too oily. I know Chinese dishes are usually meant to be eaten with rice, so tend to be on the oily and saucy side, but the soup especially tasted quite greasy. I also expected a larger portion of vegetables; although we ordered a small, I believe it was still $5-6. We also didn't receive any pumpkin, which was part of the soup's description, and I was not expecting the tofu to be fried. However the soup did have a pleasant, lightly savory flavor. \n\nNo complaints about service; our server was great and the dishes came out quickly. I don't have any strong opinions about this restaurant because our experience, although underwhelming, was fine and we didn't try the most popular dishes like the duck. Based on other reviews, it seems their food does tend to be oily, but if you don't mind or order rice, I'd still give this place a chance.", "author": "Tiffany Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-07-26", "description": "Vegan Meets Mediocrity at Best\n\nI had high hopes for Enjoy Vegetarian, but what seemed to be a cozy nook of healthy yet enjoyable food turned out to be a recipe for oily and unseasoned disaster.\n\nTo provide some hope for prospective diners, I will start off on a positive note. When you immediately enter the restaurant, you will notice that the restaurant is very clean and organized. Points for presentation. The service for this restaurant was also timely. Once my friend and I ordered food, we received our meals within 10minutes. A+ on providing efficient service. \n\nA highly appreciated aspect of this restaurant is that they serve hot tea that is complimentary to all meals. The tea was not brewed to perfection; however, it was a nice touch.\n\nIn regards to hospitality, the restaurant could use some rehabilitation. When my friend and I first walked in, no one greeted us, so we sat down on our own. This wasn't a big deal for us; however, considering it was slow and many diners are likely new to the area, having someone to immediately greet and seat customers would be admirable. Something we sensed was that the server seemed very hostile towards customers. I do not expect overly enthusiastic employees for any restaurant, but the level of hostility seemed uncanny to say the least. The waitress made minimal eye contact (if any), used a very brief staccato tone, and she failed to hand the check directly to either party. It was simply dropped onto the table.\n\nOn the contrary, food presentation was unexpectedly suburb. Aesthetically, the entrees were very pleasing and could sell themselves. Nonetheless, do NOT judge a meal by its cover.\n\nIn regards to the actual quality of the food, there is much room for improvement. Between my friend and I, we ordered the Combination Platter, Veggie Duck, Steamed Dumplings, and the Spring Rolls. \n\nThe first thing I noticed was that while the Veggie Duck had a decent texture and looked very similar to actual duck, it lacked a desirable flavor and was very oily. It was tolerable and had an unexpected taste, but if you are looking for a veggie friendly alternative to duck, look elsewhere.\n\nThe dumplings appeared normal, but with one bite, our initial expectations proved to be wrong. What you'd expect to be delicately flavored dumplings turned out to be oil bags of flavorless lettuce and dough. I was highly disappointed with this item, considering the simplicity of it and price-size ratio.\n\nAs far as the spring rolls are concerned, they were decent but tiny. For the price, you'd expect the standard proportion found at any restaurant servings rolls, but these were extremely small and overpriced.\n\nThe combination platter is really where things truly went wrong. If I weren't in Kansas anymore, this platter would've be the wicked witch of the East, dead before you ever got a chance to m(eat) it. To start, the portion was microscopic. The BBQ \"pork\" tasted alright, but the soybean sheet and tofu were  extremely oily and tasteless. I can understand that as a health promoting restaurant, they'd want to keep the sodium consumption limited, but this was beyond bland. The sweet and sour wheat gluten was the worst of them all. Finally, I thought, the restaurant managed to present something full of sweet and savory flavor, only to create a soggy red substance. Do not be deceived by it's appearance. From this platter, I believe I was most impressed with the BBQ \"pork\" for having decent taste and texture, but the majority of this palette was oily and tasteless.\n\nPotential areas of improvement:\n* Increase Appetizer Portions\n* Experiment with more balanced and flavorful seasoning\n* Improve Texture \n* Decrease oil usage !!!\n\nA major deal breaker apart from flavor is the pricing for small portioned items. For example, Enjoy Vegetarian charges $8 for six \"chicken\" nuggets. Perhaps if it were an upscale delicacy, catering to the wealthy and middle class elite, $8 would have been worth it, but not for the average joe, and definitely not for the flavor and size. \n\nBased on my first time experience dining at this restaurant, I would not recommend it for well-seasoned and oil free food. As for its service, I would give this restaurant 3 stars. They're efficient in serving their customers yet lack effectiveness in overall quality.\n\nEnjoy Vegetarian is by no means a \"terrible\" restaurant. Perhaps today was simply a bad day for the server and sodium-withholding cook. Gathered from previous reviews, their main entrees tend to have a better reputation, so I recommend steering clear of appetizers if you are considering eating here for the first time. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that I will be dining here again. Best of luck to future diners, and may the odds for well seasoned and texturized food be ever in your favor.\n\n\"If anyone would like to start a GoFundMe to supply Enjoy Vegetarian with some much needed salt, I will gladly be the first to open my wallet and donate to this WORTHY cause.\" -- My Friend.", "author": "K.

This Chinese restaurant named, \"Enjoy Vegetarian Restaurant\" serves authentic and naturally made vegan/vegetarian Chinese cuisines every year! The atmosphere is very laid back and calmer as I welcomed there. The concept is much like visiting to your local Chinese restaurant across the U.S. although for this location is much small and compact, yet it's very clean and well spaced inside filled with Chinese heritage and modern decors across the whole room.\n\nThe employees from servers and cookers are doing a good job for making the customers like me a fine service despite the busiest environment. No cons!\n\nNow onto the food! Since it's quite cold and breezy outside in San Francisco on 2/17/2017, I did managed to get a shared table successfully despite the tonight's Chinese New Year dinner crowd. At this point, I ordered the Veggie Chicken, Green Vegetables with Noodle Soup. As I ate it, that vegan noodle soup tasted very interestingly delicious! I really loved the faux chicken strips idea cause it tasted like chicken, yet in a tofu taste ways! What a treat it was! The rest of the ingredients from assortment vegetables (broccoli, carrot strips and small bok choys), noodles and vegetable broth all tasted outstanding, and I didn't feel any hidden MSG around! Beautifully presented and irresistible vegetarian dish that I've ever eaten in years. Lovely!\n\nParking at Enjoy Vegetarian Chinese restaurant can be challenging to park. You can park at the nearby surface metered street parking nor the parking garage if it's available. Likewise, you can also ride a bike, walk, carpool, ride sharing or public transportation easier without the hassles and gimmicks.\n\nIn the end, Enjoy Vegetarian Restaurant is the finest and well simple local Vegan/Vegetarian Chinese restaurant that I've ever visited for the first time right here in San Francisco's Chinatown.

The drumsticks come in four pieces with a stick through the middle to act as a bone. A little chewy that needs some help with the sauce provided. Sticky rice is a giant mass of dense rice that's supremely dry (couldn't finish). For the main course, ordered the Veggie Chow Mein ($11) and the Twice Cook Pork ($14). The chow mein wasn't too greasy and had a nice flavor of veggies (no sauce necessary). Twice Cooked pork is served on a bed of cabbage - with the faux pork meat actually being tender and easy to eat.\n\nService here is efficient (though they brought our appetizers and main course at about the same time).

I'm a vegetarian and my friend is non-veg, but we both thoroughly enjoyed our food. Considering the restaurant is in Chinatown, I was surprised at how clean the interior looks. No complaints about the service - staff were friendly and efficient enough.\n\nWe decided to share a couple dishes and a small soup between the two of us. I ordered the Basil Soy Chicken with Mixed Green Vegetables ($12.99). I absolutely loved this dish! It tasted exactly like the popular Taiwanese dish \"3-cup chicken\". The soy meat had an amazing texture and flavor - it was definitely one of the best fake meats I've ever tried! My non-veg friend couldn't believe that the \"meat\" was made of soy; she said it tasted exactly like chicken. My friend ordered the House Special Fried Rice ($10.99), which came with veggie BBQ pork, veggie ham, peas and carrots. The fried rice was delicious, and the veggie meat was also very good. Lastly, my friend ordered the small Thai Style Soup ($7.50), which came with a nice mix of tofu, broccoli, pineapple, and bean sprouts. The soup was a bit too sour and spicy for my taste, but my friend really enjoyed it.\n\nThe two minor complaints I have are location and price. It took us a good 15-20 minutes to find parking and another 15 minutes to walk to the restaurant. Also, prices were a bit higher than I expected, considering it's in Chinatown.

The empty tables were set, and there was no sign to wait to be seated, so I stood for a bit, totally ignored. I walked back to the register where the servers were congregated to ask if I should take any table, and one of the servers growled at me that it was very busy and I need to wait. Ok, fine, but I was just trying to be polite. I could have just sat at a table. Or you could have a sign. Or you could have a decent personality. All options. \n\nOnce seated, I ordered \"house\" chow mein with faux \"bbq pork\" and \"ham.\" It was complete underwhelming and unforgettable. I do wonder if I perhaps ordered the wrong thing, but I thought I was ordering a house specialty. \n\nThe overall dining experience was weird and uncomfortable. At the end of the meal, I gave my credit card to one of the servers, and she never brought it back to me. The woman who had yelled at me when I first walked in came over to ask me if I had paid, which I assumed was her way of saying \"stop holding the table and leave.\" I told her that I was waiting for my card back.

My cousin's girlfriend is a strict vegan, and she was craving Chinese food.  Since they aren't from SF, they didn't know how important it was to make a reservation on a Friday.  By the time we got here, we were beyond starved, and I was just glad to find a vegan place that fit our needs.\n\nMy overall, quick and dirty?  I loved the various menu choices, vegetarian AND vegan options, and the fact that they don't use any onions or MSG in their food.  Being allergic to onions is typically hard when dining in a Chinese restaurant.  The food was good and flavorful, but overly saucy and salty.  \n\nWe had the crispy salt and pepper tofu, which honestly will keep me coming back.  It was perfectly seasoned, crisp, and had a kick of jalapeno flavor.  We also ordered the spring rolls, taro cakes, kung pao tofu (which packed a nice kick), sweet and sour chicken, and eggplant basil tofu.  Most memorable next to the crispy tofu was the eggplant.  The flavor was good, the tofu was a perfect texture, and it had a nice basil flavor.  It was a little saucy though.\n\nWe ordered sides of rice, and I'm not kidding when I say there was nothing left.  The 4 of us ate EVERYTHING.  Our vegan out-of-towner was thoroughly impressed with the food, and she said she was going to go home and recommend this place to all of her vegan friends when visiting San Francisco.  My girlfriend normally hates Chinese food because of the saucy and saltiness, but even she was pleasantly surprised.  \n\nI had to knock off 1 star because we downed water despite the reduction of salt when we went to bed, and because I would have appreciated less sauce in each dish.

Enjoy Vegetarian Restaurant is one delicious example that has creative ways of mimicking meaty favorites. Rest assured, despite the name of some dishes, everything here is 100% vegetarian but still as satisfying as the meat equivalent.\n\nSo when I had a vegetarian friend visiting from out of town, my group of 3 decided to have lunch here. It wasn't too busy for a Saturday afternoon - we were promptly seated and served hot tea. They even serve boba tea made by the place next door, but you can order at the restaurant to enjoy with your meal! Service was friendly and attentive about taking our orders and giving us water to drink. We got the following items and shared family style:\n\n7. Drumstick w/ Sweet and Sour Sauce: This was the main reason we came here - we were curious how vegetarian chicken tasted like. Turns out their version was very good - crispy on the outside with moist, chewy layers of \"meat\" on the inside. The \"bone\" is actually a regular wooden stick. I can't really tell what it was made out of, I think some kind of wrapped bean curd? Either way, it was very flavorful and went great with the sweet and sour sauce. Tasted like chicken, and had the same salty appeal Chinese fried chicken has.\n\n15. Veggie Duck: I'm not a fan of regular Chinese duck, but this vegetarian version was delicious. I think it was bean curd wrapped over a bunch of times, fried, then cut into slices to get that texture and crispy outer layer. Where the bone could have been was filled with some kind of marinated mushroom. It had a pleasant chewy texture but was really savory and juicy, kind of like regular Chinese duck, yet without the gamey-ness.\n\n25. Braised Spareribs w/ Broccoli: This was certainly an interesting dish... it was a very saucy dish. Mixed with the broccoli and \"beef\", it was very good and had an interesting, complex flavor that reminded me of the spareribs from Din Tai Fung - sweet, savory, and peppery? Definitely reminiscent of regular beef and broccoli. The \"beef\" nuggets were soft and tasty - they really soaked up the sauce well. I think they were made with a mix of mushroom and soybean? Either way, were I enjoyed it.\n\n87. House Special Fried Rice (BBQ Pork & Veggie Ham): Of all the dishes I had, this was the most suspicious vegetarian dish - not only was it good... but the ham and pork really tasted like ham and pork. The ham was more like spam, and it had that saltiness. The pork had the red outer layer you see in Chinese pork, and the texture and taste are spot on. Don't get me wrong - the fried rice was great. But I'm still baffled that this is a vegetarian dish given how meaty the toppings tasted!\n\nAll in all, as a meat eater it was fun to come here and experience vegetarian creativity in Chinese cuisine. I'd highly recommend coming here, as the servers are friendly and the quality of the food is great. Nothing tasted too greasy and it was all quite satisfying. Portions were good too for the prices..

They won't say much, but you'll get your food quickly and once you finish eating, they expect you leave your table within a few minutes.  Standard Chinese restaurant practice.  \n\nDecor: Not bad.  Clean.  Nothing special, but not too dingy either.\n\nFood:  \n\nDumplings - skin was perfect, but filling was pretty plain. Just veggies.  Not much taste, but perfect texture.  \n\n\"Lamb\" curry - this was great.  The texture of the mock lamb mimicked real lamb and even the taste did too. It wasn't a lackadaisical attempt at calling any mock protein \"lamb\" and just adding flavors. They took the time to get the taste and texture. The curry was pretty decent.

It's either the place that I enjoy or he enjoys, it's a rare case that we'll go to a restaurant where we'll both equally enjoy. This place however, is a different story. Everything taste great even from a meat eater perspective like me. I especially love the chicken curry fried rice and the golden knot (or something, I forgot the actual name). One time I also ordered a mongolian beef, seasonings wasn't that good although I do enjoy the beefless beef. Texture was on point.

I can't talk about the sit down service, but the restaurant seemed very clean and modern when I stopped by to pick up my food. \n\nI was looking for healthier Chinese food options in Chinatown and found this place on my Yelp search. I had the Eggplant and String Bean Lunch Special ($9.99 which includes rice and a vegetarian egg roll). The food was very fresh and you can tell that there was no MSG. I also love that brown rice is an option! It's definitely a nice turn from the usual Chinese food you can get in Chinatown, which is normally way too greasy. You obviously have to pay more for your meal, but it's totally worth it to be eating food that is good for you. \n\nI'm actually super excited to try their other dishes. I've never had soy chicken or beef so I'm up for trying it soon. So glad that there's an option to eat healthy Chinese food in Chinatown!", "author": "Kelly N."}

It was interesting that the menu stated that onion, garlic, and MSG were not used in any of the dishes. \n\nI was having a hard time deciding on what to eat. I really like bean curd, but lotus roots sounded so good on that Monday afternoon! I ended up going with the string bean dish though because I love green beans. A lot of Asian restaurants use super crunchy and fat green beans.\n\nI liked my dish a lot. It was not very saucy although the fake meat was a little dry. My lunch meal came with a free egg roll and a  small bowl of rice. My friend did not like his Twice Cooked Veggie Pork at all. He could not finish the whole thing and said that it tasted very bland. He stated that it could be because he had the real dish before that typically contains meat. His expectations were different. Both of the portion sizes were decent for the lunch price.\n\nThe service seemed kind of brisk to me. The waitresses did not smile. They seemed to say \"thank you\" a lot to the other tables and did not pay attention as we were walking out the door. I hope it was because there were a lot of customers. It seemed like we were the only Asians in our age group. I noticed that the two identical receipts we received had different tip suggestions for 15, 18, and 20%. The difference was really small anyways (~30 cents). Even though the waitresses seemed a little cold to us, at least the food was good.", "author": "Kristina M."}

It doesn't help that one of my favorite places to eat in Chinatown, Chong Qing Xiao Mian, is a block away from this place. Anyways, I came here on a weekday evening with a friend since I really wanted to try out this place after finding out about it. When we went inside, it was at roughly 70% capacity, and we took a seat near the counter in the back. This place seems to have greater appeal to non-Chinatown residents since I saw a lot of tourists and what I suspect to be Financial District employees. Anyways, after scanning the menu, we decided to share a small Veggie Shark's Fin Soup as an appetizer and get our own main dishes. I decided to get the Curry Tofu Udon Soup with Vegetables as my main dish. \n\nThe veggie shark fin soup arrived and the server ladled out the soup into two small bowls for us. A small veggie shark fin soup in the large bowl translates to roughly 5-6 small bowls of soup if I recall correctly. I took a sip of the veggie shark fin soup and it was remarkably flavorful to my surprise. I never had shark fin soup before, but I remember thinking that this is probably on par with the real thing, since I'm not sure how the real version could improve the taste. My curry tofu udon soup arrived next, and I was brought back down to earth after tasting the soup. The soup tasted somewhat bland, with a hint of curry powder. The vegetables, tofu and the noodles were okay, and this dish overall was alright in my opinion.\n\nOverall, I would give the shark fin soup a five and the curry tofu udon soup a three if I had to rate the dishes individually. I sort of wish that we ended the meal with the veggie shark fin soup since it had an extremely good aftertaste. The disparity between the two dishes was somewhat amusing to me, and I would take this as a sign that this place has some things they are great at, and some that they aren't. Also, there aren't that many places in Chinatown that are exclusively vegetarian, and I'm willing to concede that it's probably way harder to make Chinese vegetarian dishes taste as good as their non-vegetarian counterparts. I think this place is an overall four after taking everything into consideration, and I would come here again for the veggie shark fin soup, but if they can make their other dishes taste as good as the veggie shark fin soup, then this place has the potential to be a solid five.", "author": "Nelson X."}

However, my friend (a fellow yelp elite) recently tried this place and had good reviews on it so I decided to give this place a try. \n\nCame here today (Tuesday) for lunch at around 1pm  and did not have to wait. We were seated right away and was quickly offered tea and the menus. We decided to do it family style and share three of the lunch specials which were only $9.99 including rice and an egg roll! We ordered the braised spareribs with broccoli, Ma Po tofu(spicy) and the beef string beans. They were all pretty good! I really liked the egg roll, wish the lunch special came with more than one, lol. I also really like how we get to choose between a bowl of brown rice or white rice. I chose the brown but my coworkers went with the white rice. \n\nThe braised spare ribs tasted just like real meat! I was really surprised. The texture and flavor of the spareribs were so accurate. I probably wouldn't even be able to tell that it was faux meat if I didn't know better. The broccoli that came with the dish was a little bland, but still fine as long as you put some of the sauce on it from the spareribs. \n\nThe beef string beans were really good as well. The beef was very flavorful and tasted just like real beef - this dish was my coworker's favorite. \n\nThe Ma Po tofu had some mushrooms bits and some peas in it and was very flavorful. It also was not too spicy so it was good for me since I can't handle too spicy. Also goes really well with rice! \n\nOverall, it was a great experience eating at a vegetarian restaurant for my first time. Pretty cool how their faux meat tastes just as good as real meat. I will probably come again and try other items on the menu. I'm really glad I gave this place a try! Also very convenient because there's a new boba place connected to this restaurant (E Tea). There's always room for boba! ;)", "author": "Bailey L."}

Being a meat-eater and lover, I find it a bit difficult to eat meals without meat being my main source of protein.

The place is fairly busy at lunch time, but luckily, I did not have to experience a long wait. \n\nMy friend and I ordered the lunch deals, which were exactly just that- a deal! We shared the Kung Pao Soy Chicken w/ Pepper & Broccoli and the Sliced Fatty Pork w/ Sweet Mustard Greens & Napa Cabbage.\n\nThe lunch deal came with a spring roll (not to be confused with Vietnamese spring rolls, as these were fried) and your choice of either white or brown rice. Both dishes were really tasty! No lacking in flavor. The portions were decently-sized as well. My friend and I were satisfied from the food and ended up boxing some leftovers. For $9.99, you definitely get a good amount.\n\nWill definitely come back as the menu seems to have an endless list of options. I'm sure you would be able to find a dish you love.

This place definitely looked interesting based on the yelp review and I was eager to try it out for myself.  Starting from when I first approached the door, it has the no meat sticker on the door, cute subtle touch.  \n\nWe were there on a Friday night, and there was only 2 other parties eating in the restaurant, a little empty but I didn't mind.  As we were given the menu, I was a little intimidated by the wide range of selections.  So many dishes made to look like meat, but aren't meat.  My husband was a little confused since he was never exposed to vegetarian cuisine before.  After studying the menu for a good 5 minutes, I decided to play safe and stuck with my tofu selections for my first try at this place.  \n\nWe started with dumplings and hot and sour soup, for entries we ordered the coconut taro and pumpkin and the satay tofu and eggplant, plus 1 bowl of rice to split. \n\nThe food came very quickly after our order and I was very pleasantly surprised by how good the dumpling turned out.  The filling is made of mixed vegetable (which includes mushroom) and it was very flavorful.  The hot and sour soup was a little too thick and not sour enough, but I still liked it.  As for our main entrees, my husband is a big coconut fan so he liked the coconut sauce in his entree, but complained that the taro was too dry.  I have to agree with him after I gave it a try, seemed like it wasn't cooked very well.  As for my eggplant and tofu dish, it was a delight, everything I have hoped, very flavorful and meaty (in terms of chewy texture).  \n\nI really enjoyed the food, but I have to say for a vegetarian chinese restaurant, this place is not cheap.  Each entree was around $10.99 and they charged $2.50 for the rice.  I think I would definitely give this place a try again, but I would probably want to explore some other vegetarian place first for comparison.", "author": "Young N."}

This little place was neat and rather pleasant. I wouldn't categorize it as hole-in-the-wall. It was lunch time. One table was occupied by a family with two toddlers - playing with their food and squeaking from time to time. Then many other 2 person tables were seated by office people eating alone. Many nationalities which I think was a good sign. The wash room was clean, reflective of kitchen condition in my opinion.\n\nThis is definitely not a restaurant you would immediately fall in love and nothing resembling high street experience. There were only two lady servers who were doing their job but not particularly customer friendly.  The lunch specials were $10.99 for a dish of your choice accompanied by rice (white/mixed grain) and one spring roll. The menu was very extensive even for the lunch specials. So, we ordered fried (faux) chicken nuggets ( which were actually mushrooms), mixed veggie deluxe (#13) and soupy vermicelli with chicken (#44). My friend was not impressed by her vermicelli. But I liked the rest. Because their deep fried was crispy and the dishes were not greasy. Quit flavorful. I actually finished all of them... portion was on the small size.

Since there were 4 of us, we ordered 4 different dishes: the rice cakes with mustard greens, spare ribs with broccoli, green beans with sea bass, and tofu & veggies. The meal came with a starter of an egg roll for each of us. All of the food was pretty good; I especially liked the rice cakes and the sea bass actually tasted like real fish.

Granted it has been 8+ years since I've eaten real fatty pork but they actually managed to get the different layers of 'fat' and meat' into some facsimile of real pork.

One of the waitress was extremely rude and yelled at us \"if every customer did like you we would lose our business!!!\" when we tried to switch to a bit bigger table because we saw lots of available tables. I looked around, we had been sitting for about 10 mins and we were still the only customers in the restaurant. The business was pretty slow around 5 pm when it just opened, why made it so harsh to the customers? In addition to that, after she yelled, she ran to the tables where we sat at earlier kept banging the empty chairs on the floor furiously and angrily by making loud noises.\n\nThat was a very bad experience for us.\u00a0 Our mood was totally ruined during the dinner. The waitress didn't know to respect customers at all.Besides, the food was ok but not good as expected. The foods are overpriced\u00a0 with small portion.

M-F from 11am to 2pm there is a lunch special for $9.99 that includes an entree with brown or white rice along with a spring roll. Complementary tea is served yet didn't have it as I avoid caffeinated beverages. \n\nEnjoy Vegetarian Restaurant is the second all vegan Chinese restaurant I've been to recently in San Francisco's Chinatown. The biggest challenge here is too much choice as there are 50 items to choose from for the lunch special & all of them are vegan so it is truly a vegan heaven!\n\nOne of my favorite things about Enjoy Vegetarian Restaurant is that the menu has pictures of each of the entrees so this gives you a good sense of what you order. I've often gone to other restaurants & what I think I'm ordering turns out to be something quite different.\n\nI decided to order- L37 Kung Pao Tofu w/ Pepper & Broccoli\u5bae\u4fdd\u8c46\u8150\n\nAs the picture menu showcased this entree had lots of broccoli & bell pepper which was what I wanted along with a good amount of tofu. The Kung Pao Tofu entree also comes with peanuts. \n\nThe Kung Pao Tofu was listed under the spicy section yet didn't find it that spicy yet the flavor was great & you can always ask for it to be more spicy. If you want more of kick there is hot sauce on the table to make it more spicy yourself.\n\nPortions here are hearty so bring your appetite or bring a friend to share or bring your own tupperware to take home leftovers. Eating lunch here will give you some plant powered fuel to conquer the surreal epic hills nearby that makes San Francisco so famous & fun to explore.\n\nAlso worth checking out nearby is the oasis in the city & one of my favorite bookstores on the planet \"City Lights Bookstore\" which is just a four minute walk away. \n\nI look forward to returning to Enjoy Vegetarian to try out some more of the 50 entrees. You can almost come here once a week for a year getting a different entree each week!", "author": "Shane S."}

I've tried other vegan/vegetarian chinese places in the past and it's made me a little hesitant to try more. However, my friend told me about this place and we ended up having dinner here around 6PM on a weekday night. \n\nRight near the Hilton hotel in Chinatown/on Kearny it's an easy place to find. I docked the review 1 star because the service was a bit slow and inattentive. Right when I walked in I wasn't sure whether I was to wait for someone to seat me or sit down myself since the workers were near the cashier in the back so I tried sitting at a table but was asked to move to another table. \n\nTBH I was still a little hesitant when ordering but we ended up getting the broccoli beef (had carrots) and rice cakes w/ mustard greens. Both were DELICIOUS. The veggies were perfectly cooked/crunchy and the fake meat was flavorful. I can honestly say it's some of the best, if not the best i've had so far. The rice cakes were also a new fave in my book. They give you tons of greens with the rice cakes so it doesn't feel too heavy and it adds a nice change in texture to the dish. They give you plenty in portions as well! For 2 people we had tons left over and left feeling full.\n\nI was greatly surprised and will definitely be coming back here/bring my friends! Don't worry if fake meat isn't on your list to try because they have a large variety of noodles, veggies, and tofu dishes.", "author": "Keizzel C."}

I dealt with the aftermath for the next several days. I would have loved to add a new vegetarian place to my repertoire, but after that experience, I will not be coming here again.

This is, of course, an insult to tofu--a versatile weapon in the kitchen--it is reduced to being little more than a token gesture.\n\nEnjoy is a pleasant reminder that vegetarian takes on meat-based dishes can be done without sacrificing flavor. It has no airs about itself; its dishes are pleasant and filling versions of standard dishes one would find at many Chinese restaurants presented as-is; its service is standard for most Chinese restaurants: blunt and to the point (you're here for the food, not the service). Being just a short walk away from the Financial District, it is definitely worth keeping on a list of restaurants should one have any vegetarians in the lunch crowd.", "author": "Erwin T."}

I was hesitant about eating here because at heart, I am a carnivore but I have nothing against veggies and am always open to trying new foods. I checked out the Yelp profile as well as their website and saw that they offered a variety of dishes, including many with meat substitutes. After seeing photos, I wanted to try the \"chicken\" drumsticks for sure. \n\nWe came on a weekday at around 11:45am and there was only one other customer. The restaurant felt clean and bright. We sat at a four-person table but the waitress asked us to move to a two-person table, as she did with other single and couple customers. Moving was no problem but I was assuming the restaurant was going to get very busy yet by the time we left about 45 minutes later, I would say only half of the restaurant filled-up. A group of 8 folks came in so if you're interested in visiting with lots of people, they can accommodate larger groups. \n\nWe indeed ordered the drumsticks to start. I decided to order the won ton noodle soup with veggies and veggie \"ham,\" and my sis ordered the braised \"spareribs\" with daikon and other veggies. The lunch dishes each came with a basic veggie spring roll but I was a bit concerned because my spring roll was straight cold and old, and my sis' spring roll was hot and fresh out of the fryer. Despite this, I have to say that all of the food was flavorful. The veggies were fresh and I really enjoyed the braised daikon which was so tender. The \"meats\" were as meaty as could be in light of they fact that they weren't actually real meat. The ham in my soup was smoky and the drumsticks and the spareribs had meat-like texture in which they would shred as if you were biting a real piece of chicken or rib. Overall, I found that the food was satisfying!", "author": "Maya S."}

I don't know why but they only hand you the main menu. You have to ask your server for the drink and dessert menu. One would think they would want to sell more of the iced teas but unless you know they have drink menu, you wouldn't even know they exist. I usually order them with the popping boba but the last visit wasn't able to because the waitress said they don't have them anymore. I hope they bring them back.\n\nThere are book shelves with Buddhist literature for your viewing pleasure if you find yourself alone. Everything on the menu is vegan. They don't cook or use garlic or onions in dishes because they follow the Buddhist rules of vegetarian eating. Near the cash register, they sell some packets of mock meat. The bathrooms are close by the cash register. \n\nI have had the wonton noodle soup and enjoyed it with a friend. They brought out a ladle and small bowls along with the big bowl of soup. There were plenty of vegetables in the hot soup. The soft wontons were stuffed with veggie filling. The soup had a mild flavor which is fine for me but you might want to order something different if you want more of a punch in flavor. I think it is a good choice for warming up in the winter. I usually order the basil soy chicken. It has carrots, broccoli, bell peppers, basil, and faux chicken simmered in a savory broth. I have never ordered dessert so I can't comment on it. \n\nMy friend, A., has tried the braised ribs, fatty pork slices, and golden knots. He liked the braised ribs best. The golden knots were his least favorite. My friend, S., had the walnut prawns and didn't like the creamy sauce that came with it. He only ate half of the dish. He did say the faux prawns were ok. \n\nFor most of my visits, the service was either polite and friendly or indifferent but still somewhat attentive. Unfortunately the last visit had poor service and the server acted like she didn't want to be there. She barely came around and looked annoyed when I asked for the drink menu. She also gave my friend and I the wrong drinks. I can understand dealing with people can get tiring so perhaps she was having a bad day. Hopefully this poor service won't happen again. \n\nNext time, I am going to try the braised ribs.", "author": "S A."}

The $8.50 Kung Pao Tofu was way too saturated with the all-too-familiar mystery brown sauce for us to appreciate the spiciness of the dish (see photo). We also would have preferred our tofu sauteed rather than fried, but there was an abundance of stir-fried vegetables to complement the tofu cubes. The most intriguing dish we had was the $8.50 plate of Sliced Fatty \"Pork\" with Sweet Mustard Greens and Napa Cabbage (see photo). You have to understand that I was a heavy-duty pork belly junkie before I turned my back on meat.\n\nI think I was in rehab with a couple of butchers and a bulimic, so any semblance to pork was something I needed to try. The mock-pork so obviously came out of the can because it had that gelatinous sheen to the faux-meat, and the fat was, I believe, pure gelatin shaped to look like gristle off a pig. It kinda worked but maybe more because I hadn't had real pork for three months at that point. Mixed with the cabbage and the greens, I could almost feel I was satisfying a carnivorous craving. Almost but not quite. The place was quite crowded, so obviously it has a following. Service was on the perfunctory side - and of course, everyone was skinny. But I think I'll go back to my steamed chicken at Hunan Homes. It may be too \"meaty\" for my diet, but it's probably better than digesting canned fake-meat.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...not as good as CNNGo would have you believe\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...speed is an addiction for the staff here...I mean the pace, not the drug\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...standard Chinatown decor and rather noisy with pay toilets available for non-customers\nTOTAL - 3 stars...Enjoy was not all that enjoyable", "author": "Ed U."}

This said, I grabbed an extra chair for her to rest her foot on as she nursed and entertained her baby at the table. Baby was getting fussy. That evening, the restaurant was 1/4 to its capacity and the chair wasn't a safety hazard or upsetting fellow diners.  The tyrant hostess walked up, grabbed the chair without permission right in front of my friend as she held her child in her arms.  What a ghetto, insensitive b****!!!  \n\nAbove is just one example of the increasingly bad service provided by the hostess and waitresses.  Other times, I literally had to stand or walk-up to flag the waitresses down for additional tea or other services. One time, a waitress gave my guest and I the check midway through our meal.  What about asking 'Would you like anything else?' or 'Would you like the check?'.  Is that too much to expect when dining-in?!?! Also, when dining-in anywhere besides a fast-food joint, what type of waitstaff idles behind the counters or around the kitchen areas, muttering amongst themselves??  Also, how about greeting guests when they come in and seating them instead of smirking 'Sit anywhere.' and tossing the menus at patrons??\n\nI've been dining at this restaurant/chain for years.

My favorites are: Lemon Sauce Fried \"Chicken\", Sweet and Sour \"Chicken\", House Special Fried Rice, Eggplant in Spicy Chili Sauce.  You can't go wrong with those dishes.  I know they labeled the eggplant dish as \"spicy\" but it was not spicy at all.

Passing by this vegetarian restaurant brought back memories of temple food, and that one time in college when I became a vegetarian for a year at UCSC because of my hippy vegan ex-girlfriend, so I vowed to give the restaurant a try if an opportunity were ever to arise. So when I discovered that there was yet another location downtown which remained open during my lunch breaks at my other gig at Union Square, it was like music to my ears.\n\nSo moving past my usual methodical formula of a  personal anecdote followed by an actual semi-informative review, I tried the Soy Basil Chicken and the Sweet and Sour Pork and could not believe either was not meat. Or soy. Or butter, for that matter.\n\nEvery lunch entr\u00e9e you order comes with your choice of white rice or delicious brown rice; service here is prompt and efficient -- the food usually comes out within six to seven minutes of ordering; I usually spend twenty minutes walking here from my workplace at Union Square, about ten minutes eating, and then twenty minutes back to work, leaving me just enough time to put a smile back on my face for work.\n\nBack to the food itself. The Soy Basil Chicken actually takes like any kind of regular basil chicken that you find at a Thai restaurant. It does come with a healthy serving of broccoli and carrots, which I didn't care too much for. The actual \"chicken,\" along with the basil and choy are cooked in a delicious yet light soy sauce, so not to overpower the actual taste of the vegetables themselves.\n\nThere was nothing special about the Sweet and Sour Chicken, except that IT'S NOT CHICKEN! Until I tried the Sweet and Sour Chicken here, my expectations of vegetarian cuisine in America was either Tofurkey or Seitan; Enjoy takes what should be painfully bland and mediocre into something that's deliciously mediocre, kind of like watching the paralympics on TV.\n\nFor those of you concerned solely on taste and not about how many animals died to provide your delicious meal, Enjoy is closer to a three-star than a four-star--The food here tastes like any other Chinese restaurant two blocks away in Chinatown.

I would have preferred more green tea flavor instead of the syrup flavor I tasted.\n\nThe kitchen works quite quickly and soon I was brought the Fried Spring Rolls (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XKj8_4QdoBMeYcg6OoespA?select=xWk0I0S9KWMB06wKUEDYxg).  Fried up golden brown the crispy, thin wrapper was stuffed with a hot (in temperature) cabbage, carrot and bean thread filling that almost seemed creamy.  These were very good spring rolls with or without the sweet and sour dipping sauce which accompanied it.\n\nThe Bean Curd Rolls (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XKj8_4QdoBMeYcg6OoespA?select=vVS_mxjcKdhopgpADsaInQ) looked fabulous.  These were served over steamed spears of perfectly cooked Shanghai bok choy in a tasty sauce accented by strands of Chinese black moss.  The Bean Curd Rolls are chewy soybean sheet layers stuffed with napa cabbage, mushrooms, strips of sweet soybean sheet, carrots and other fungi.  The taste was excellent and paired quite well with the nuttiness of the brown rice.  So good, in fact, that I ate everything that was brought to me.\n\nA complimentary dessert of fresh orange wedges and sweet, dark burgundy bing cherries arrived with the check.  Much like their other location the service here was very friendly and efficient.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

After my experience at Enjoy however, I think I need to change my mind...\n\nFood here was great, we had: nian gao which had fake pork in it that really tasted like pork (more like ham than the normal pork you get with nian gao but still, for fake meat I was impressed!), Mapo doufu - I guess Enjoy follows a particular Buddhist tradition that stays away from stronger flavors so this was more sweet than spicy but actually really tasty (just don't expect your normal mapo doufu), a basil pineapple broccoli dish that was more Thai than Chinese but really good, Eggplant/green bean with blackbean sauce - different than I'm used to since it didn't have any garlic but surprisingly good, and the \"chicken\" drumsticks which again for a total fake meat dish were really tasty!\n\nThe only negative from our experience was when they took our tea away and didn't bring it back until we finally asked them for it, I mean seriously, what the heck? :P\n\nOverall a great place, I'm excited to try the Enjoy in inner sunset as well and will definitely be back here in the future.", "author": "Ely L."}

(there you go sriracha sauce). \nAll in all it was a decent noodle meal with crisp vegetables but the vegetarian \"meat\" had a strange aftertaste that did not quite pleased my tastebuds.\n\nThe spring rolls were perfectly crispy but at the same time they did not taste like anything - I definitely had better ones.\n\nAll in all there is to say that I was a little disappointed by what I got because I did expect more.

This food is absolutely delicious! \n\nHowever when I got home strangely I didn't want the left overs. I wrapped my chicken drumsticks in cellophane and my basil chicken was in it's little white box. The next night I still had no interest in eating it. I found this odd because I sure did enjoy it at the restaurant. A week later I had forgotten all about it and noticed the drumsticks hadn't gone bad. At this point I was intrigued and I decided to ride this out and see what happened.\n\nNo joke, a month later the drumsticks were the same. I hesitantly opened the box with the basil chicken in it, fully expecting to find some moldy mush since I was in a way conducting a science experiment at that point but guess what?\n\nIt looked the same. Even the bright beautiful green and red bell peppers were the same. Not a wrinkle, no shrinkage, nothing. It was like it was from yesterday.\n\nSo anyways, I won't claim to know what is preserving the food or even if it's food at all, I'm just doing the right thing and saying what happened. Don't take my word for it though, try it yourself. If you are still okay going there after you watch your leftovers NOT go bad. More power to you. Personally I only want good things in my body.

Enjoy Vegetarian does a delightful job of simulating, and sometimes surpassing, meat-based Chinese dishes.  I'm an omnivore that doesn't mind eating vegan dishes every now and then; I'm easy going and open minded like that.  I mean, it's not like I proclaim \"I'm an omnivore!\" at every restaurant I enter and then proceed to grill the server with 20 questions to verify what I am about to order is truly omnivore-friendly.\n\nFragrant Crispy Chicken: Way better than Popcorn Chicken!  Stochastic structured crispy exterior, way crispier than what you get at KFC.  Juicy and chewy interior.  A light sweet and sour sauce for dipping.  If you're gonna have mysteriously shaped deep fried protein chunks, better to have it be vegan than from pink chicken goo!\n\nVeggie BBQ Pork: The only dish I didn't care for.  It looked like slices from those red pigs you see in Chinatown butcher shops, but the taste was not nearly as good.  There was no texture differential to simulate lean meat, fatty chunks and crispy skin.  Instead, it had the one texture of fish cake and the taste of bland seitan.\n\nTaro, Seasame Veggie Chicken Cooked w/ Coconut Sauce: The coconut sauce was so rich and savory, they could have put anything underneath and made it taste good!  I really enjoyed the taro chunks since that tuber is often absent from menus despite being so yummy.  The chicken impostor tasted like heavily marinated dark meat but had the appearance and texture of thickly sliced deli chicken log.  But given how bold the coconut was, appearance/texture of the chicken wasn't so important.\n\nTwice Cooked Pork: Looked, tasted and felt like thinly sliced pork used in Chinese stir fry.  If anything, it was better since it didn't have that not-so-fresh pork after taste found in many Chinese restaurant that use lower grade pig products (I prefer Kurobuta or Ib\u00e9rico).

The won tons weren't nearly as fried and bubbly as their non-vegan counter parts in most restaurants, but they were very good.\n\nMy friends and I got the kung pao \"chicken,\" clay pot soup, and twice cooked \"pork.\" They were delicious. I'm not normally a fan of fake meat, but the chicken was delicious and the pork was surprisingly delightful. I'm not a fan of the clay pot soup because it's a little more bland than I'd like and the tofu was squishy and undesirable. \n\nFor dessert though! Out of this world! We ordered the fried bananas with coconut ice cream and the donut balls. The bananas were phenomenal, whereas the donuts were much like chocolate filled mochi balls but with a weird peanut crusting. Not nearly as satisfying as the bananas and ice cream.\n\nIt's not the best Chinese food in the world, but I definitely enjoyed it.

Not too long after, she brought a pot of tea and gave us a few minutes to decide on our order. \n\nThey have a lunch special where you can choose from about 20 different selections and it comes with a bowl of soup, 1 egg roll, and a bowl of white or brown rice for only $7.50. I'd say that's a deal compared to eating in the FiDi where everything is at least $10. \n\nTo start off, we ordered the samosa which comes in 5 pieces. M ordered their Braised String Beans w/ Spicy Chili Sauce, K ordered the Spicy Ma Po Tofu, and I ordered the Sweet & Sour Chicken. Yes, I said \"chicken\". Don't worry though, there are no meat products served at Enjoy Vegetarian as it's a Vegetarian/Vegan restaurant. The \"chicken\" is substituted with a soy product. \n\nBraised String Beans w/ Spicy Chili Sauce - good, but the chili sauce they used is the kind you would see at a dim sum restaurant. I wasn't a fan of it.\n\nSpicy Ma Po Tofu - good, but wasn't a fan of the chili sauce they used.\n\nSweet & Sour Chicken - great\n\nOverall, service was great. The waitress was attentive and friendly. I would come back for lunch if I'm craving for some vegetarian food when I'm at work.", "author": "Candice H."}

More importantly, it is a good way to recover from my Fatty Fridays, Sugary Saturdays, and Split-my-Pants Sundays. \n\nEVR has a great lunchtime special. For $7.50 you get: a cup of soup, a veggie spring roll, brown or white rice, and your pick of 30+ vegetarian dishes. The dishes contain no garlic, no onion, no MSG, and no dairy yet still manage to taste good! \n\nThe soup I tried and liked was similar to a Korean Miguk soup with seaweed, tofu, and miso. The veggie spring roll was crispy but not greasy and filled with carrots, cabbage, and mushrooms. My favorite dish so far is the simple but well prepared trio of Stir Fried Mixed Green Vegetables (yau choi, bok choy, broccoli) with a few carrots thrown in. The Preserve Mustard Greens, Soft Tofu, with Broccoli was also a solid choice. I was less enamored with the Kung Pao \"Chicken.\" The spicy sauce had a nice amount of heat but was too salty. The \"meat\" had a unique texture that was paradoxically both chewy and mushy. I liked the peanuts, red and green bell peppers, and zucchini that were mixed in but I probably wouldn't order this again.

I've been to the Kirkham iteration of this many, many times.  So now I head for this sister location for reliable food that I like and also a place to sit down ... tables seem to always be available.  The fact that it's not far from City Lights Bookstore is a big plus.  I like visiting both places in one journey.  Note that this restaurant's venue on Kirkham and 12th Avenue is small and crowded by comparison and requires a reservation.  This Kearney Street venue is spacious, and has always had empty tables when I've dined here.  The menus are the same ... both with my favorite resihi Chinese medicine soup. \n\nI've been here twice, the second time a couple of weeks ago.  The experiences both times were inspiring.  It's not likely that I'll make it through most of the menu in my lifetime which makes this an especially inspiring destination.  I've had no disappointments and many moments of great inspiration with a dish I would not have thought possible.  \n\nEnergy-wise, the Chinese medicine soup with Reishi (#24) has never failed to make me feel very energetic the following morning.  To me that's one of the signs of a really great meal.  I'm sensitive to the outcome the following day. \n\nFrom this menu: \nhttp://www.enjoyveggie.com/pdfs/dinnermenu_forweb_ed.pdf \nI find that the Lotus Root dish (#54) fulfills my veggie sensibilities of heaven.  The very next dish with Cordyceps mushrooms, yams and gingko nuts (#55) is powerful fortification for a rainy day.  \n\nThere are too many other items that I've tasted with great surprise ... fish dishes that taste remarkable as if cooked with a flavorful fish.  \n\nThis restaurant is in the tradition of temple food for Buddhist monks and nuns.  That is, it is truly vegan in every way.  Furthermore it is cooked without onions, garlic or MSG, as stated on the front of the menu.  This latter detail is in support the work of the temple and the mediation of the practitioners  One does not want food that \"stirs the qi.\" ... so to speak.  \n\nI'll be visiting here on a regular basis for all of the above details that I can rely upon plus a reasonable price.", "author": "Em S."}

Woop woop.\n\nThen, Enjoy opened up my eyes, took me wonder by wonder, and showed me a whole new world.. of vegetarian food.\n\nI was pretty skeptical of the \"MONGOLIAN BEEF!\" and \"KUNG PAO CHICKEN!\" because they weren't really beef or chicken.  Everything is soy or gluten-based.  Sketch...\n\nI still have to say that I don't really like the texture of the vegetarian beef in the Mongolian form, but the flavors are excellent, the portions are generous (their lunch special is $7.50 for a bowl of rice - white or brown, a crispy spring roll, a bowl of soup, and the dish), the place is clean, and it just all falls into place.\n\nMy Ma Po Tofu was yummy.  The sauce was a bit too sweet and not spicy enough for my liking,  but the tofu was silky and soft, and the brown rice was cooked perfectly.  My other complaint is that the bowl of rice they give you is heinously small.  Seriously, it was maybe 1/4 the amount that I would normally eat.  But then again, I'm convinced I'll die of gluttony someday.\n\nThey even have yummy-looking desserts (we were too full to try) like fried banana with ice cream, and coconut milk with black sticky rice.

But every once in a while I'll go to Enjoy instead and I'm usually happy I do.  Enjoy is a little bit different from places like Loving Hut and Golden Era because they are even more restrictive with what ingredients they'll put into the food (for example, there is no garlic or onion.) As someone who loves both those ingredients, it's hard to imagine food tasting good without them.  But Enjoy somehow manages to offer a huge menu of delicious fake meat and vegetable dishes.\n\nI've loved almost everything I've ordered here.  The lettuce wraps and crispy chicken are both particularly excellent.  One item I did not care for was the drumsticks, but maybe that's just because I was comparing it to the drumsticks at Golden Era (which are out of sight.)

The mustard green veggie ham soup with soba noodles are great when I'm not craving rice.  One thing that never changes is that regardless of what I order, the portions are huge, especially for a lunch special.  (Don't forget the soup of the day and egg roll that also come with the order.)  The pictures don't do them any justice.  The food takes up the whole plate/bowl (their side of rice is skimpy, in a smaller bowl, but probably the right amount if we're talking portion control).

By the time I arrived, I decided I wasn't all that hungry after all, so settled for steamed buns and a bowl of miso soup.\n\nThe basic problem is that none of the food has any savory-ness, and it all also lacks salt.  Both of these are problems in terms of flavor, but also particularly regrettable in a vegetarian restaurant, since one of the main complaints of omnivores is that vegetarian food cannot be satisfying.  I was brought a complimentary spring roll, that tasted like... deep fried rice paper with cabbage inside.  Needs something sesame or peanut, and SALT.  I kept an open mind, and was brought my miso soup.\n\nNow, as with much Japanese cuisine, miso soup is a simple dish that trades heavily on proper technique and ratios.  This soup tasted mostly like dashi, there was not nearly enough miso.  Probably a bit too much wakame, but I wouldn't had noticed if the soup was competent.  Yes, even the miso soup lacked salt!\n\nFinally, the steamed buns.  Same problem.  Really bland, like eating unseasoned dough with some strangely acidic cabbage filling.  Salt salt salt your food, seasoning is like the first thing a chef learns.\n\nIt pains me to write a one-star review, but I really do want to discourage people from coming here.

The service is great (friendly workers and quick service), the restaurant is clean, and the prices are very reasonable. It's located conveniently near Chinatown and Financial District.

It was still very tasty. The sweet & sour wheat gluten was my favorite out of this dish. Order a large if you're planning to share this with more than 2 people since the small only has about 3-4 pieces of each variety.) \n\n-Fragrant Crispy Chicken - $5.99\n(The \"chicken\" is made with soy but it tastes just like chicken! It was fried perfectly with just the right amount of crisp. I would recommend this appetizer.)\n\nEntree:\n\n-Black Pepper Sauce w/ Steak Meat & Green Vegetable - $8.50\n(Great taste!  The soy protein doesn't have the same texture as real beef but it was still very good. This dish is generously portioned and the sauce was very tasty.)\n\n-Taro, Sesame Veggie Chicken Cooked w/ Coconut Sauce - $8.50\n(Highly recommend this dish if you like taro or coconut milk! The taro was cooked just right and the coconut milk made the dish so creamy and tasty. The soy protein tastes just like chicken.

Fortunately, this 2nd location is conveniently close to work.\n\nI was glad my meat lovin' colleagues were keen to try EV. They had the Mongolian beef and sweet and sour chicken.  They liked it, even though the meat was fake - was told the chicken tasted better than the real thing.  I had the eggplant, tofu, basil stir fry. Delicious!\n\nWe enjoyed their Lunch Special (Tuesday through Friday, 11a - 2p). For $7.50 you get the soup of the day, an entree from their special list, spring roll, and your choice of white or brown rice. For some reason, we were all happily full after consuming 1/2 our meal.  Great leftovers for Round 2.\n\nEV uses Buddhist veg. principles - they don't use any animal products, no egg nor dairy.  They also don't use MSG, onions, nor garlic and cook with reduced oil. So it really is good for you (and for your present company - no mints needed).  Most of their fake meat are created out of soy products.  \n\nI've been to this space when it was a different restaurant, and what a transformation!

Coming from Florida, I am easily impressed by vegetarian restaurants, but this place stands out even in Bay Area California. Wonderfully cooked soft and tender \"pipa\" stuffed tofu is not found in many restaurants, but it is delectable here. The \"spare ribs\" were also quite interesting and delicious. Most dishes are very healthy with vegetables, but of course there's fried delicacies too - just gotta have that fried sometimes. The fried taro cake was different from what I am used to - here it is a lot more taro than at many other places. For dessert, crispy sesame balls with red bean filling were crunchy and just sweet enough without being overly sweet, and cute size at it (small but tasty! In this case, size doesn't matter!) And if that weren't enough, you can get to-go \"tzong tzi\" which is banana leaf wrapped sticky rice with filling such as mushrooms, chestnut, and veggie-ham, to take home to eat the next day - just steam or microwave. Mmmmm. Yummy.\n\nThe restaurant itself is decently decorated, a good size, and clean. Not the fanciest place in the world, but definitely above average style wise.

Occasionally they'll forget to bring me something like ice water (they bring tea to the table automatically instead of ice water) but they are always apologetic. \n\nThe lunch special is a fantastic deal, it's around $7.50 and you'll get a spring roll, soup, rice and a decent sized meal.  Try and beat that in the area! They obviously serve a lot of lunch specials and the food does come really fast (particularly the spring roll and soup), but it doesn't effect quality. I sometimes get the feeling that they are rushing me out the door, but to be fair to do come in right around closing time. They never have a problem if I stay after closing, but they're busy cleaning away when I'm finishing up.\n\nThe food is pretty damn good.

I'm a vegetarian and I hadn't eaten all day so I stopped by around 8.30pm. The staff weren't very friendly and I felt a little rushed, I was still clearly looking through the 4-page menu when they were asking me if I was ready to order (probably less than a minute after they even handed me the menu) I went for the tofu, eggplant and basil dish with a side of steamed brown rice. I got home and opened my rice..they gave me white rice instead of brown (which I don't eat, so it was a waste of money) The satay sauce was mostly oil/water consistency and disappointing. The tofu was okay, I mostly enjoyed the eggplant which was cooked just right. Overall I wouldn't rush back again, it was okay but very underwhelming and for the price I expected more.", "author": "D S."}

In fact, I tried the veggie-life for a few months and didn't writhe in agony during meals. (Chicken satay just knocked on my door one night, and I couldn't turn her down. Temptress.)\n\nThe folks at Enjoy Vegetarian really know what they're doing with veggie dishes. I live near their other location, but found myself stumbling around the Financial District after a couple of drinks craving some salty food. Salty food found. That's one thing I love about my herbivore-happy buddies, they know how to salt the heck out of everything. \n\nHere's what I do: \n-If it's your first time, ask the waitress for suggestions. The menu is pretty daunting, and if you're used to eating meat centered meals, you need all the help you can get. \n-Order the Fried Curry Potato Triangles, they have just the right amount of curry. \n-Order the House Special Fried Rice. It comes with veggie bbq pork and veggie ham. This was awesome, it tasted like bacon. Real bacon, made from pigs. \n-Enjoy the orange slice they give you to end the meal (Maybe it's just me, but orange slices after meals always remind me of my glory days - being the worst player on my youth soccer team, who always volunteered to sit out).", "author": "Chanti B."}

His cousin was not, but the manager/owner recognized him and gave us some free crispy chicken on the house. Awesomeness!\n\nFirst of all, the manager (and I think owner) of the restaurant is super nice and personable. She always has a smiling face and constantly asked us how we were doing. \n\nWhen I looked at the menu, all the food items looked so delicious and tempting but in my mind I thought, \"This is not real Mongolian beef and walnut shrimp...it's fake!\" Indeed it is fake but the taste is absolutely genuine and to die for. We ordered the Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and mapo tofu. The mapo tofu wasn't very special as I've had that everywhere else but it was the beef and the shrimp that amazed me. Although the Mongolian beef was too salty, the food tasted so novel and so foreign but tasted so damn good. \n\nAlso, make sure to order the pearl drinks! They are less than $3 and the pearls are amazingly fun to drink. Unlike tapioca pearls, these pearls are covered with a thin skin filled with sweet juices inside that pops in your mouth. Kids will love doing this.\n\nOverall, this restaurant alone changed my perception of eating \"vegetarian.\" I used to have an ignortant perception of what vegetarian food now but this restaurant has opened me up.

The Taro/chicken/coconut was lacking any flavor at all and the Taro chunks were large and mushy, and uncooked in the middle. The \"chicken\" was rubbery and did not have the texture of chicken at all. The sauce was thick and flavorless. My boyfriend's fried rice dish was lackluster at best with very little flavoring. The samosas seemed to be pre-frozen and nothing special and over priced at $6.99. The meal came to about $33.

They are more blunt and gruff cause some Chinese culture are like that. (not all)\n\n(Lucky Creation workers also love to talk across the room, and you're in the middle of the room trying to munch your chow)\n\nIn summary, ENJOY  is definitely a good, clean, healthy place to go eat.  I don't have to worry about oily hydrogenated oil or cotton seed oil, MSG food which is too common in some Chinese Restaurants.   \n\nFor the past 40 years of my life, I was told, you MUST have MSG in Chinese food or it will be tasteless.... or that's the only way Chefs know how to make food and they won't listen to you!

I've got dietary restrictions so I lead a vegetarian/pescetarian lifestyle, so I'm pretty okay with the fake meat deal.\nThe chicken here is okay, I've had much better at other restaurants (New Age Veg in the Tenderloin or Merit Veg if you're ever out in the Santa Clara area). However, I definitely like the Mongolian Beef dish. The soy beef is textured very similar to real beef, and the taste is really good. I also tried the beef broccoli but found it be bland and the gravy to be an odd consistency.  So, I just stick to the mongolian beef which hits the spot every time.

It was a bit difficult to fine but that could be because of the massive crowd trying to get a peak of the end of the parade. We made it, after a bit of  difficulty pushing our way from the swarm. \n\nI made a reservation and they seemed to remember, even though I had made one the night before. Pretty cool. The service was good. Our server was nice and gave us plenty of time to think over our options. We ordered a number of things: chow mein, tofu, shanghai style rice cake, some pork thing, sea bass with egg plant, and spinach fried rice with pine nuts. Everything was delicious! \n\nThe crazy thing was... the foods that were supposed to be meaty but was soy tasted like what they were supposed to. As a result, I pushed all the faux ham to the side (much to the enjoyment of my friends) because it tasted too close to ham and I'm not a fan. The sea bass tasted and had the texture of real fish. I don't know if it tasted like real sea bass but it tasted like fish! \n\nThere was so much food left over that it was insane how little of a dent 5 people could make. The bill came to about 45 dollars, which is good considering the amount we got. Tessie and crew took the left overs and we left with a full belly. \n\nOh yeah, and if you aren't a customer it's a nice $2.00 to use the bathroom. Just fyi!", "author": "squishy b."}

Being able to freely walk down the sidewalk without bumping into a jockstrap was welcome.\n\nThe restaurant was fairly empty. A+, this meant food would be quick.\nThe menu was reeeeally extensive.  Crap.  This meant it would be hard to decide.\n\nAfter what seemed like forever we decided on the \"Beef\" w/ Stringbeans and the Golden Knots.  Spring Rolls too, at my request since I wanted fried. \n\nI felt like I deserved some fried after doing well in the massive crowd at Civic Center.  I usually don't survive too long in those things.  Being 3 apples high, being in a crowd smells like armpit, you can't see the stage and inevitably someone will spill beer on you or try and steal your wallet.  \n\nThe \"beef\" was convincing without being too disturbingly close to the real thing.\n\nThe Golden Knots were different but good (think thin tofu sheet filled with tofu and veggies then wrapped up and shaped into a knot).  \n\nBoth dishes with brown rice and spring rolls came to a reasonably priced dinner and left me happy and recovered from the festivities.", "author": "Jen I."}

Since I'm not vegetarian, I've resisted until a couple of weekends ago.  I'm so glad they didn't give up on me.  This restaurant was wonderful!\n\nThe first thing I noticed was how clean and modern the restaurant looked!  Next, I was delightfully shocked to see they don't use garlic, onions or MSG in their food.  I'm not a big fan of those ingredient and this was the first restaurant that I've ever been to that doesn't use garlic or onions.\n\nThen I worried, would the food be any good?  I LOVED our dishes!\n\nWe had several dishes starting with the Salt & Pepper Fried Squid.  Tasted just like sliced calamari.  We then had the lettuce wraps with a mushroom, veggie chicken, vegetables and pine nut filling.  This dish is a favorite of my friends and now I know why!  Nice large leafs of fresh lettuce, some hoisin sauce, and plenty of the filling (which they give you a HUGE portion) - so refreshing!\n\nWe also had the walnut prawns.  The imitation prawns almosted tasted like the real thing but something was not quite.  However, the dish was still tasty.\n\nThe tomato beef chow mein was fabulous!  The slices of imitation beef looked and tasted like the real thing.  The best part is that the restaurant did not use any bell peppers and onions like you'll usually find at other restaurants as a filler.\n\nWe also had the sliced fatty pork with sweet mustard greens  and napa cabbage.  Pretty good!  I'm not quite sure what the imitation slice fatty pork tasted similiar to in a regular Chinese restaurant.  Not quite like chao siu (not as sweet).\n\nMy favorite dish of the evening was the bean curd rolls stuffed with mushrooms and cabbage.  They put the generous serving of the rolls in the center of the platter then surround with fresh baby bok choy.  One of my favorite dishes when I go for dim sum, this veggie substitute tasted just as good.\n\nFinally, the waitresses couldn't be any friendlier!  We stayed until closing and they didn't rush us at all, but kept stopping by to tell us about the dishes and other items on the menu.  They then surprised us with a complimentary dessert which was freshly cooked and amazing!\n\nOh!  I also have to really point out the portions were so generous!  We ended up with so much food to bring home.\n\nIn all, I'm so happy to have been introduced to Enjoy Vegetarian Restaurant.  I can now have Chinese food without any concerns about eating healthy!

The menu is incredibly long so definitely look through the Yelp reviews for ones to try.  I really liked #90 bean curd rolls and bok choy, the lemon chicken, and the combo platter.  My friend had wonton soup which was also good.  I got a vegan thai iced tea and their hot tea was also good.  My other friend got prawns with cashews which was a little on the bland side.  All in all, I really liked it and want to go back to try some of the other 95 items on the menu.  Update: I now work nearby and have gone many more items.  My recent faves are pie pa tofu balls and golden knot.  Their lunch special is an unbeatable deal at $7.50 for soup, spring roll, and entree with brown rice.

I've been here a couple times, and I remember liking it more when I was here last year. My most recent visit, I ordered the tri-spice 'chicken' in a clay pot. During my first few bites, my impression was more 'this tastes strange' than 'this is amazing', and I don't stray from faux meats (I have an addiction to whole foods' soy popcorn 'chicken'). The taste grew on me, though, and I can definitely say the meal was enjoyable. I ordered brown rice instead of white, for which I believe there was a small charge, but it's always nice to have that option. My boyfriend, an omnivore whom I recently converted to tofu by cooking it for him, ordered the kung pao tofu and wasn't much of a fan. He said it was 'too soft'. Whatever. He's basically the opposite of a tofu expert. But it's tough to say that Enjoy is a great place to convert a staunch omnivore.\n\nMy favorite part of the restaurant is the bright yellow decor.

Nice place to recharge before you continue your journey!", "author": "michael s."}

Being vegetarian we are always on the look out for veg friendly places and we were not disappointed with this one. We are not always big fans of fake meat, but we enjoyed everything we ordered. A dish with gluten, tofu and greens was delicious, even my two year old loved it. The eggplant and chilli dish was also delish and the eggplant was cooked perfectly. The restaurants was not busy and the service was pleasant and helpful, they were willing to give some recommendations which I liked. They are kid friendly and my two year old was happy with his special plastic plate and fork.", "author": "Nim S."}

I was excited when they opened their second location in Chinatown because it would be just close enough for me to go for lunch. I love going there for the lunch special which includes soup, egg roll, entree, and rice. It's a great value for a wonderful vegan meal which is also really delicious. I've brought co-workers, friends, and family here and everybody has really enjoyed it. The people there are also very friendly.

I moved to Germany a year ago, but I came back to SF last month to visit.  I told me parents that I need to pig out on some good Chinese food (the Chinese food in Germany sucks!) and to my delightment, I found out that Enjoy just opened in Chinatown.  I love how convenient the new location is.\n\nThe decor is really nice and sleek.  The staff speaks English as well as Cantonese (and probably other Chinese dialetcts too).  They were also very nice and offered my mother and I ice water because it was a very hot day.\n\nThe food is delicious, and fairly priced.  They offer a huge variety of Chinese dishes, more than most vegetarian Asian restaurants (such as Golden Era or Shangri-La).  The best part?  Vegan Thai Ice Tea!", "author": "Jolene L."}

The service was top notch and the veggie fried rice was excellent, some of the best I've ever had. They put in fake meat cubes and peas and carrot squares. The bean curd pocket and vegetables was OK - a little bland and not good once it cooled off. Drumsticks were standard. I've been to the one in the avenues and it seems like they have the same menu. \n\nYou have to be careful with this place since they don't use garlic or onion.

There were many choices on the menu and since I'm not much of a fake meat eater I went for the Veggie Deluxe which comes with napa Cabbage, mushroom, fungus, broccoli, baby corn.  They told me it was not spicy so I asked to modify with adding chilies.  The wait staff seemed very quick during lunch which I was happy about since parking around here is insane..Anyway my first thought was the brown rice bowl of was tiny and it kind of was.  The main dish was plenty and I was impressed with the two types of mushrooms which were unique and fresh tasting.  I also thought the baby corn was really fresh tasting vs. many times they taste like from a can.  It really wasn't spicy like I wanted but I guess I kind of figured that out when I saw they don't use any garlic and such.  Anyway it had this really original sesame \"Chinatown\" taste which I guess I can't really describe but I really liked it.  The service was very quick and I even got to pay right after they delivered the dish.  Lunch special comes to about $10 with tip which for SF standards is probably good. Overall I'm a fan and would recommend this if you are in the area.", "author": "Ron K."}

I'm a vegan, and I enjoyed the fake-meat dish that I ordered, but meat-eaters at the table were not impressed -- I suppose the rule is that if you've liked fake meat products before, you'll also like these ones, but they won't change your mind about anything. All in all, I'd say the food was just decent. Nothing was wrong with it, but nothing was really special about it. They claim to use no garlic or onions, which I suppose is a plus to some, but I found myself really missing garlic and MSG! I think in their effort to be really health-conscious and agreeable, they didn't do the vegetables as well as meat-serving Chinese restaurants do when they really go all-out with the seasonings. Service was good, tables were available even at peak lunch hour. Exploding boba were like... a car crash in my mouth. I wasn't sure if I liked the experience, but it was so morbidly fascinating that I couldn't stop doing it to myself over and over again.

There is a lot to choose from on the menu... it takes awhile to decide what you want. My friend got a \"fatty pork\" dish, which sounds gross but it was actually quite tasty and the way that they created the tofu was rather clever. It was shiny tofu most of the way down but the very end was clear to represent the \"fat\" - although we think it was agar agar based. I don't know if they make this fatty tofu on site or get it from a vendor, but either way, it is a very clever tofu creation. The beef in the green beans and beef dish was the same that you would get at other vegan restaurants, but it was goood... especially as leftovers the next day. If you go lunch time, they have cheap lunch specials for one. Oh yea, and if there are two of you, two dishes and a soup will be more than enough food for you to eat.", "author": "Mimi T."}

Nevertheless, I stumbled upon this place on my way home from the gym, and knew it would be the perfect place for me to get a taste of Chinatown. The menu was so big, my roomie and I had a hard time narrowing down what we wanted to order... so, we just ordered it all. Wontons, Eggplant & String Beans w/ Black Bean Sauce, Tomato Beef Chow Mein, Mustard Green Veggie Pork Fried Rice Cake. Everything was tasty, fresh, and felt reasonably healthy. Bonus points for brown rice.  Our server was super friendly - she gave us a lot of recommendations, and when we ordered she managed to laugh and say, \"wow, that's a lot\" without making us feel like total pigs. Also, the place is very clean & decorated nicely. In general, I'm not a huge fan of faux-meat... but it was pretty good here. However, I've never seen faux-fish before... that just seems weird to me... I'll stay away from that... but I will be back to try more of the other entrees!", "author": "Christine K."}

I left this place feeling stuffed! Their flavors are also very distinguished, not a mishmash of veggies all thrown in with the same sauce. They clearly cooked different veggies in different manners with different sauces or seasonings and then blended them together, as appropriate, for a medley of vegetarian delight where you can savor all kinds of flavor with every bite. The bean curd rolls with veggies was phenomenal! My boyfriend went bonkers for the thick sauce that coated the bean curd rolls. We were absolutely in love with the eggplants, basil, & tofu combo in satay sauce. TO DIE FOR! Asparagus were smoky and hot and just delicious! The basil and the satay made for a killer combination. I got the curry chicken pot which was yummy. It was a bit too sweet for my taste. More on the dripping coconut milk side of curry sauces if that's your thing, but all in all, still delicious! Their brown rice was awesome! I love the mixed grains that they put into their brown rice. The place was clean and updated and the service was low-key but attentive. Wonderful place!

I've tried several other places before, both in the South Bay and in San Francisco - usually they are places I would go only once and possibly not again for a couple years, just for the novelty of eating at one of these Chinese vegetarian places that serves fake meat.  But this place is good!  The food is tasty and many of the fake meats taste and texture is uncannily like the real thing.  Even not counting the novelty factor of the fake meat, I would come hear to eat just because the dishes taste good, and could stand right up to regular non-vegetarian  restaurants.  It's not overly salty or greasy (like some other places I've been to) and I've already been back three times in half a year.

We tried Enjoy Vegetarian Restaurant and loved it! First, it was very clean and the service was prompt and friendly. The menu is extensive, so we asked for a recommendation (I already knew I wanted to try the Mongolian Beef). We got an order of the pot stickers and the \"chicken nuggets\" to start. The pot stickers were good, but deep fried, which I didn't expect. The \"chicken nuggets\" were great! Crispy on the outside, moist on the inside, and flavorful. My husband got a \"chicken\" dish with basil and it was wonderful. I really liked my Mongolian \"beef\" and we both had beer with our meal. Don't know why it says \"no alcohol\" in the heading for this restaurant. Because of that info (I found the restaurant on Yelp), I didn't expect any, but was offered, beer or red wine when we ordered. I didn't ask to see a wine list or anything, so don't know what they had, but we had the beer so they definitely had that. Anyway, we really enjoyed our food, the service was friendly and good, and we will definitely come back.
