It's called, \"E Tea.\" E Tea serves the customers of all ages to taste their finest selections of Taiwanese bubble tea drinks and juices every year! The atmosphere is very active and on-going as I welcomed there. The concept is much similar to your local bubble tea cafes across the U.S. although for E Tea, it's pretty small and compact just like visiting to your local small ticket booth outside the movie theater. The menus here are simply basic giving clearer details before you order.\n\nThe baristas here are doing a good job for making the customers like me a remarkable service. No cons.\n\nNow onto the drinks! After I glanced over the drinks menu, I ordered the Rose Green Milk Tea with black bobas with 30% sweetness with regular filled ice cubes. As I drank it, that milk tea tasted impressive! I can feel the mixtures of both rose pedals and green tea leaves combined in an aroma elegant! The 30% sweetness did worked like magic after mixing it completely, so I can satisfy my taste buds in no time! Not a bad drink after a stroll!\n\nParking at E Tea in San Francisco's Chinatown can be challenging to park. You can park at the nearby surface metered street parking or the parking garage if it's available. Otherwise, you can ride a bike, walk, carpool, ride sharing or public transportation easier without the hassles and gimmicks.\n\nIn the end, E Tea is the finest and well established bubble tea shop that I've ever discovered for the first time in San Francisco! Perfect for your everyday drinkie needs! A well received! My rating: 4 solid stars.", "author": "William L."}

The cute cow logo is also an enticing logo to sucker kids of all ages, including this 46 year old-fart, to come here. \n\nI tried coming here many times, but this shop was constantly too crowded. After many attempts to come here, I finally had the opportunity to try the cool beverage naming after the Walt Disney character. For $3.99, the drink is a mixture combination of a strawberry green tea (Pooh's red shirt), a thick mango milk (color of the bear's furry skin) and lychee jelly. I don't drink much of these beverages, because the mixed beverages tend to be on the extreme sweet side. This drink was no exception. Though it may not be as sweet as Pooh's jar of honey. But it was definitely pretty damn close. \n\nThe menu is reasonably priced and really limited with this thirst-quencher being one of the shop's top-seller. Yeah, majority of the customers are much younger and loved this beverage and others from here. \n\nNormally I would never check in to a business twice in one day, especially from a drink spot. I bought the same beverage for my friend. I got the same beverage, but with the shop's customized plastic bottle for an additional $.50. I heard the shop is not environmentally-friendly and will not reuse the bottle for your next trip. Though I may bicker on them not reusing the plastic bottle, but the bottle is still pretty cool with the cute cow logo. \n\nI was just wanted to see the hype about this place.

I wasn't expecting much, but I was wrong. They have a pretty big menu, and to hopefully make things easier, they listed their top 10. I was torn between Black Sesame, Coconut Taro Sago and Winnie The Pooh. I ended up picking Winnie The Pooh (strawberry green tea with mango milk and lychee jelly). The sweetness from the strawberry and mango and earthiness from the green tea mixed so well together! Not one flavor dominated the other. I was expecting a sorta heavy cream, thick tasting drink since it said mango milk but it was more on the lighter side. \n\nThis boba place is no Quickly's nor T4, so don't expect seating or snacks. It's a very small grab-and-go spot. You can choose from soy or almond milk for an additional 50 cents. They do have reusable cups for 50 cents more from the regular plastic cups, BUT I do not think they are cups you can bring back to get a few cents off your next drink. They can serve your drinks in a split cup; also for an additional 50 cents. They serve creama drinks, floats, hot drinks, slushies/ smoothies and cheese  cream drinks. You can also adjust the sweetness and ice level.\n\nI didn't like how the cashier didn't ask what size drink, if we wanted to add any toppings (boba, jellies, etc. etc.), or if we wanted the reusable cup instead.\n\nIn my opinion, this small boba spot is worth a try for all you boba lovers and/or just anyone taking a trip around Chinatown in the city and crave something sweet to drink. I will definitely be coming back here, because of the different drink mixture options they have!\n\nP.S. They close at exactly the time listed, so if you happen to be waiting outside, they will gladly let you know they won't be serving you anymore.", "author": "Rachel C."}

Uhhh probably not.\n\nE-tea is located on the edge of Chinatown. I had walked by this particular boba shop a lot absent mindedly in the past, mostly because the location is tiny, and I was finally lured in when they saw that they had cute glass bottles. \n\nBut the glass bottles are pretty deceiving. Normally at a lot of other boba shops it feels like you get slightly more for upgrading to a glass, and HERE they actually charge you more for the glass WHILE giving you less of the actual drink. For a plastic component for $4, you get it in a 24 oz, while in a glass component they'll charge you around $5-6 for 20 oz. \n\nI'd choose the plastic, because why pay more for less drink, right? I mean the glass bottle is cute, but still.\n\nWhen I went in, there was virtually no one in line, aside from the person working, who looked bored on their phone. I also tried looking to see if they had a stamp card option there, but couldn't find anywhere in the front, but apparently if you ask they'll provide one for frequent customers.\n\nWinnie the Pooh - ($4) - Half Strawberry Green Tea on the top, with Mango Milk, Mango Chunks, and Lychee Jelly on the bottom. Maybe I expected a lot more since apparently this was one of their top 10 items but I didn't enjoy my drink.\n\nThe Strawberry Green Tea top half was fine, but I didn't really love it all that much.\n\n The mango milk bottom was creamy, but was verging on tasting like it was starting to go past its prime, and the mango chunks on the bottom were also sour and threw me off. Lychee Jelly was fine, but I mean I've never had a bad lychee jelly soooo....\n\nMixing the drinks together, I completely did not like the drink at all. Separately I think they would have done much better but mixed together, they just seemed to separate from each other and it just tasted a little odd to me.\n\nWhile E Tea was okay, I certainly was not mind blown over it either, which is why I'd rate E-tea a mid 2.5, going to a 3 but not really there. Out of the tons of boba options in Chinatown, let alone SF, I wasn't impressed enough to want to return nor will I recommend it, as I have other options I like better.", "author": "Allison O."}

See, my family tends to put some stock in the Chinese zodiac. And my mom, being born the year of the cow, REALLY LIKES COWS. \n\nSo as we're heading home after a dinner at the Stinky Rose and we place this place by, which my mom recognizes because one of her friends has the glass bottle. And she just ADORES the little cow design on a milk bottle. \n\nThings to note: Be aware the glass bottles hold 20 ounces in comparison to the 24 oz. of a regular cup (even if the glass bottle cost a few more cents). They also sell a plastic bottle that is good for cold drinks, but not for hot drinks or anything that requires you to put it in a freezer. Additionally, this isn't a sit down place. It's an indoor stand more than anything else, so just heads up: there won't be anyplace to sit here. It was clean, well lit, cheerful, colorful, and busy. Kudos on how the signs and advertisements are attractive and pasted on almost all the walls, the tables, windows, and then the extra board out front.\n\nBecause we've had just eaten at Stinky Rose, a place that is famous for it's garlic and garlic-based dishes, I chose to go with a mango slush with boba instead of a milk tea or the King Taro. And honestly? I loved it! There was a lot of boba on the bottom, a layering of some kind of mango gel, and the actual mango slush tasted of mango fruit (not just flavoring). It was thick, and I think that contributed to it lasting pretty long instead of immediately melting into liquid. So there's a plus for getting the glass bottle.\n\nWhen we were there, it was pretty busy. So it does get a good number of people and small groups after dinner time. After all, it's in a prime spot to take advantage of all the after-dinner and lunch crowds from the nearby restaurants. As a result, we did have to wait a bit. Not long, but for those who are not as comfortable walking out in San Francisco at night and get nervous...(I have some friends who are, as well). But the place itself is well-lit and maintained. Overall, fun experience and I liked what I got. My dad really like the passionfruit tea and my mom is happy with her cute, reusable glass bottles. Would come again to try out some of the other stuff. \n\nSpeaking of reusable, it would be cool if they had an option where you can bring that bottle back in and get it filled with a drink of your choice for a lower price (because discounting the part of actually buying the bottles as part of the purchase).

The one thing that makes them stand out over other similar places is their ingredients; they don't taste fake or artificial. Granted, of course I'm sure they use some flavoring but most, if not all, of their fruit flavored drinks contain real fruit.\n\nWinnie the Pooh is a nice contrast of creamy and refreshing. Their fruit teas has a nice balance of fruit to tea, having a nice fruity flavor followed by the slightly bitter tea flavor. I think their non-milk tea options definitely stand out exceptionally whereas their milk teas are pretty standard which is satisfactory but doesn't make them different from most other boba places.\n\nTheir prices are more than reasonable, might I even dare to say underpriced for their quality. The staff is friendly and fast. The only \"problem\" to this place, if you can even call it that, is that it is small so when there is a line or crowd waiting for their drinks, there really isn't anywhere to stand to wait; or sometimes when abnormal weather in San Francisco is occuring, you can't avoid the sun or rain.\n\nI highly recommend this place and I've been to my share of boba places.", "author": "Richard C."}

But alas, that's what you get for going out on a craving instead of checking where to get a good drink.\n\nI didn't have the customer service problems that other folks experienced, but I did have the same meh experience with the drinks. The Fresh Taro King costs $3.99, which is pretty middle-of-the-road. While I'm fairly certain real taro was blended into it due to the gritty nature of the drink, it seriously lacked flavor. It literally tasted like milk with a hint of root vegetable. I'm not a big advocate for powder in milk tea drinks, but this was one of those cases where it could've used another spoonful.\n\nThe glass bottle costs more, of course, but holds a lot less drink than the cup does. Like many other millennials, I may be a sucker for cute packaging, but I'll take the plastic cup if it means I get more bang for my buck.

Barely a line at the time and I asked to pay the extra charge. Additional $0.50/bottle and cash only for the bottle upgrade. Glad a nicer person came to assist me as the other woman made our drinks.\n \nOrdered: Guava, Mango and Winnie the Pooh.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-03-25", "description": "I decided to give this place a couple tries to give a fair review. This place is interesting, as it seems to be a part of Enjoy Vegetarian right next door. The first time I came here, I went to the actual spot, which was a small space-a counter to order, pretty much. No seating. The second time, I ordered E Tea was with my meal at Enjoy Vegetarian (just a tip if you want to enjoy some boba with your meal). \n\nI've tried the Black Tea Float and the Fresh Fruit Tea in the Strawberry flavor. The Black Tea Float I was hoping would have a similar taste to Sharetea's, but lacked in sweetness/flavor. I enjoyed the Strawberry tea more than the float, but still, I was not necessarily wow'ed. I tried some of my friend's Fresh Taro King, and while it did taste fresh, I felt as though the flavor was not there. Both times I felt as if the drinks could have been significantly improved had they added some more ice (I ended up adding some more ice myself). It's great if they want to prevent the drink from being diluted and potentially losing more flavor, but the coldness really makes the drink that much more enjoyable. \n\nBeing in an area of a myriad of boba options, E Tea would not be my first choice, but they do offer decent drinks. I know this place is fairly new as it just opened up a couple weeks ago, so there is always room for improvement! The Winnie the Pooh sounds pretty refreshing. Maybe I'll give that a try the next time I'm eating at Enjoy Vegetarian.", "author": "Meghan J."}

The drinks that they have are actually very similar to Plentea. Prices are roughly $3.99 for a 24oz plastic cup and $4.50 for a 20oz glass milk bottle (but hey, it's good for the Insta). We had the Taro King and Matcha Red Bean, each at 25% sweetness. We went a bit late at night so they were actually out of boba so I replaced the boba with sago in the Taro drink. The taro is made with half real taro and half powder but the flavor wasn't all that strong unlike somewhere like Teaspoon, the sago was also a bit clumped up. The red beans in the matcha drink were also a bit mushy and the matcha flavor wasn't that strong. The service was nice but you could tell they were new as they were training someone in the back. \n\nOverall, a decent place especially if you want to collect more boba glass bottles (no refund on bringing a bottle back unlike Plentea) with average boba.", "author": "Jason W."}

So he asked me if its ok with coconut, i said ok. So he poured 1/3 of the mango smoothie out, poured the boba, then he went to the fridge and poured more mango smoothie to the top. AT THIS POINT i was turned off how the drink wasn't made fresh, so eeeekkkkk..... \n.\nThen i went on yelp to look and saw someone posted a pic of the empty canned mango which is in their garbage can in the front which is like wow no fresh mangos in involved. \n.\nAnyways the mango smoothie was not good whatsoever. Wasn't ice cold at all, and overly sweet. As well the boba is bland with no flavor cooked into it.

I thought milk tea was like milky not kinda cloudy-clear. The rose Milk tea was gross. My mom just threw it right away. Watered down. Not sweet no matter how much sugar we asked for. Lastly, the strawberry one. Was just syrup, water, half of the container with ice. The 5 year old kid wanted to see how gross it was and he spit them out.

They have a pretty large selection of drinks, but no place to sit (or really stand, even) and it reminds me of the boba shops in Hong Kong. I got the almond jasmine tea boba, and for whatever reason, it wasn't sweet at all! There was no other flavor except for the slight almond flavor. Maybe it's my misunderstanding and assumed the drinks would be sweet like any other boba tea drink out there but I was very disappointed. My friend got the coconut taro and unfortunately they use powered taro mix. Sad to say, but I probably won't be back. Many other options around the area.", "author": "Athena L."}

I was so excited to see a new boba place as I frequent cool tea bar down the block. I'm too lazy to walk to sharetea or itea a couple blocks down. Those who work in Fidi know what I'm talking about! \n\nThey have a large menu and it's your typical boba joint. I came around 12:30pm on a weekday and the line was pretty long. They were pretty slow at taking the orders and pushing out the drinks. However the cashier was extremely friendly and served everyone with a smile! She happily answered any questions and it's rare to see that level of customer service nowadays. Props to her! \n\nI got the taro king drink and it didn't taste like taro AT ALL. I don't think I'm a picky boba drinker. Yeah I frequent itea and other popular boba chains, but I feel that you can't mess up a taro milk tea. Well, that's not the case. \n\nTaro drink was completely watered down. It says it comes with fresh taro which it did, but one may think it will intensify the boba drink. All I tasted was the milk and taro chunks. No taro flavoring at all. Maybe they didn't use enough powder? Who knows. \n\nI'm not sure if I'll return. If I do I may try their flavored tea instead of milk teas. Let's hope things will improve!", "author": "Sarah I."}

Had a strong chocolate aroma, I think if I requested 50% sweetness it would of tasted better. \nMocha frap: give it 2 stars. tried my friends drink, it had a lingering almond powder taste.

If you're eating lunch at Enjoy Vegetarian, you can also order drinks from E Tea! They will add your drinks onto your bill. My friend and I didn't know that until we were done with our meals. We were packing up our leftovers from lunch and noticed that the server provided an E Tea menu to a nearby table. We requested the drink menu as well and decided to order our drinks inside so we wouldn't have to wait outside in the rain. If you're outside ordering from E Tea only, there's only enough space to go to the counter to order and then you step aside or outside to wait for your drink.\n\nThis was our second time ordering a drink from here. Last week, I got a Fresh Taro King with boba and this week I tried the Green Milk Tea with boba. I thought the boba was decent but the drinks lacked flavor. They're not sweet enough and they do not ask how sweet you would like your drink. I would come again if I'm eating at Enjoy Vegetarian but if I'm craving a sweet boba drink, I would pass on E Tea and go somewhere else nearby.", "author": "Jenn W."}

The boba was a nice chewy texture and was sweet- no complaints. My sister got their oolong milk tea (50% sweet) and unfortunately hers was not very flavorful and seemed watered down- maybe because she got 50% sweet? Would not recommend.\n\n\nPrices are fair and this is a great addition to Kearny. I also tried their mango sago drink at their Geary St location and I really enjoyed that one but it's a bit pricy. Also important to note that this is truly a to-go type of boba place where you just order and go. There is no seating or restrooms. They also have s second location on Geary and this one has seating and shares a space with a restaurant (so yes bathroom).", "author": "Kathleen Y."}

Pro tip, if you normally like it a little sweet by normally boba standards, don't do 50% here, just do the normal sugar.
