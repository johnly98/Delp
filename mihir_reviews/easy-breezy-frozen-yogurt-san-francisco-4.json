This place was a short walk down a few blocks from where we were.  The store was pretty simple with a number of different flavors to choose from including red velvet, vanilla custard, mint chocolate, a non-dairy mint mojito, and tart.  We were able to sample a bunch of flavors, but the staff needed to help us dispense the yogurt into the mini sample cups.  The staff member serving our samples, gave us some good insight into his favorites and the most popular combos.  I ended up getting a mix of the tart and the mint mojito.  The tart was solid.  Creamy with a good amount of that sour pucker you are looking for in such a flavor.  The mint mojito was very minty but not at all over powering.  I would definitely stop by this place again if in the area.", "author": "Mitch T."}

Because, you know, that will keep me cool in this hot, stuffy house...\n\nAlthough I'm around 9th Ave fairly often, I'd be lying if I said I was well aware of Easy Breezy all of this time.  And believe me, no one is more disappointed with myself than myself.  I mean, to think - all of those trips to the neighborhood (and all of that fighting for parking) and so many opportunities for froyo that I missed out on!  Sadness.\n\nLike so many other froyo joints out there, Easy Breezy allows you to fill your cup with whatever combination you like of their offered flavors and finish it off with their array of toppings to pick from.  While the containers and trays of toppings are largely typical (sprinkles, nuts, bits of candy, mochi, fruits, syrups, etc.), the quality of their froyo is what makes them stand out.  Only about eight types are available on any given day, but they go beyond that, offering each with varying fat contents (non, low, medium, high, and full).\n\nDuring my two visits, I've mostly stuck with the same toppings (I'm boring like that), but I've tried a handful of their flavors:\n\n-- Pistachio, Vanilla Bean, and Vanilla Custard with Peanuts, Almonds, and Strawberries: (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/easy-breezy-frozen-yogurt-san-francisco-2?select=qnIDAJJ7EkdsxBtWhu1Eng)\n-- Chocolate Custard and Coffee Custard with Mochi, Peanuts, Almonds, and Strawberries: (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/easy-breezy-frozen-yogurt-san-francisco-2?select=TZyAYbulEiEXpS2Nv7f9sA)\n\nThe Almonds, Peanuts, and Strawberries were fine (hard to screw them up), but the Mochi was great - just the right gumminess and not overly sweet.  Of the five flavors I tried, the custards were the best for the most part (I thought the coffee one tasted a little off).  Not so coincidentally, the three also had the highest fat content (full fat), but they were the most flavorful and the creamiest.  The pistachio (organic, low fat) was pretty solid as well, but the vanilla bean (non-fat) was disappointing (thin, milky texture, almost tasteless).\n\nAs tasty as their stuff may be though, at $0.75 per ounce, Easy Breezy feels a little pricey compared to other froyo places I've been to.  However, there's no questioning the quality you get.  Plus, they have stamp cards, so they do offer some value back.  In any case, forego the few tables they have inside and take advantage of the benches out front.  Perfect for those warm, SF nights, but pretty nice when it's not so warm as well, especially when you're on a date!  Get cozy... ;)", "author": "Mike L."}

The cheapskates in us would also maybe just bring a baggie of toppings (nuts, fruit, and chocolate are all things we have a large supply of at home) and dump it on our bowls once we paid for the yogurt.

But IN A FROYO INSTEAD!\n\nFinally got to try this place out! They have the cutest little mascot standing outside their shop telling you what the flavor of the day is. And today was my lucky day, their flavor was mint mojito. \n\nThe interior is a bit small but well-kept. The back wall contained the self-serve froyo machines and their cutely designed cups. In the middle of the shop contained all the toppings. What I really liked about this place is that it was so. Simple.\n\nI love simplicity, and this place kept it sweet and simple. There was 8 flavors, including the flavor of the day. My default froyo for every place is usually strawberry, but since they didn't have it today I opted for vanilla bean to match with my mint mojito.\n\nI love how unique the toppings are here. You don't see \"chocolate turtles\" or \"potato chips\" elsewhere. Sweet meets savory meets chocolatey meets fruity. So many endless possibilities from something quite simple.\n\nOverall:\n- A bit pricier than most froyo joints, but a lot of their stuff is actually organic so I can see why it's expensive.\n- The mint mojito really tasted minty and citrusy, which I loves me a lot of. The vanilla bean gave it the creaminess that you'd usually find in froyo.\n- Mochi was nice and chewy, and I like the colorful kinds.\n- Blueberries were fresh, not too sweet and not too tart. Strawberries were refreshingly tart.\n- WAFFLE COOKIE THINGY. IT WAS ADDICTING.\n- Yogurt chips were crunchy and creamy sweet :}\n\nThey were playing swing music on Pandora, I laaaaaaaved it!

I couldn't tell my Pinkberry from my Red Mango if my life depended on it, and if my life depended on it, I'd have to ask what kind of lactating Armageddon would we be headed toward to create those kind of sensibilities? It would be a world dominated by skinny young girls sampling all the flavors in those little paper cups before telling each other they're too fat to consider having any froyo. Not me and certainly not Jamie W. We just had pizza at Pasquale's a couple of doors down the street and just wanted something a bit refreshing to clean our tomato paste-saturated palates.\n\nI had heard about Easy Breezy's Noe Valley spot but never tried it. so it was a happy circumstance to find this recently opened second shop open for business. I'm not a sampler. It's a waste time for me. I was immediately intrigued by the presence of a flavor called Oaxaca Chile, so I went for a cup and manhandled that spigot like nobody's business. I thought the non-fat Vanilla Bean would make a smooth contrast. I was right. A sprinkle of chopped toasted almonds and a couple of spoonfuls of fresh strawberries made it exactly the post-pizza creamy goodness we wanted to have (photo: http://bit.ly/1eg3FNm). Maybe I am a frozen yogurt connoisseur.\n\nFROYO - 4 stars...a nice kick to the Oaxaca Chile that made the froyo more interesting than the standard variety\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...clean little shop with just a few seats\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...friendly servers\nTOTAL - 4 stars...\"they're Easy Breezy, and I'm Japanesey\"...not my line, Utada sang it...finally an excuse to type it somewhere", "author": "Ed U."}

Hallelujah, our prayers have been answered with Easy Breezy!\n\nThe froyo itself is very good, albeit I can't tell that it's organic or local or gluten-free or whatever it is that's making the price so high. The original tart--which is always my go-to froyo flavor no matter where I go--is well-textured and truly tart. There are also other fun flavors, like banana cream pie and busta limes (ha). The machines work well and allow you to do a swirl of two flavors, if you so desire.\n\nBut what REALLY makes Easy Breezy standout is their full-fat frozen custard. Pictures really don't do it justice and neither will words, but I'll try: Imagine a flan or creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e but in ice cream form and with more fat. Oohhhh yeeeaaaahhh. And you can even add toppings to your frozen custard too (more on this later) but the custard is so freaking good by itself, that added bonus almost becomes forgotten.\n\nSo the 5 stars I'm giving here really is for dat custard. But Easy Breezy didn't stop there and decided to make their toppings selection almost as equally impressive as their frozen treats. I'm very much used to Asian-run froyo places where the standard toppings are fruit, rainbow mochi, popping boba, gummies, etc. Well, Easy Breezy has all that (yes, even rainbow mochi and popping boba, which were pleasant surprises) and WAY more. There's caramel-filled chocolate turtles, peanut butter sauce, marshmallow sauce, bacon bits, potato chips, waffle pieces...the list goes on! My only complaint is that the toppings table juts awkwardly into the store's space and it can feel cramped even when there isn't a lot of people present. I wish there were a way to move that table so that it's against the wall perpendicular to the froyo machines.\n\nAnyway, to summarize this sheaf, as a froyo place, Easy Breezy easily breezes past other similar self-served froyo chains (e.g., TuttiFrutti, Tuttimelon, Yoppi, etc). On the basis of just their froyo alone, I'd rank it at around the level of Pinkberry, Red Melon, and Yogen Fruz, but just slightly below Fraiche. But as a frozen dessert place, Dat Custard and those toppings really make this place something special and makes all non-Sunsetters even more jelly!", "author": "Tiffany H."}

However it held my attention because people always suggest to come here for dessert.  I'm coming to appreciate this local business-type froyo parlor because we definitely do not need another froyo chain or boba store in the area, and it is now rapidly ascending the ranks for my go-to dessert place.  \n\nCompared to Holy Gelato: despite not being holy and not being gelato, I like how Easy Breezy is  healthier (or so we think... until you become addicted to those full-fat flavors) and the price comes out to be quite a bit cheaper (unless you're one of those people who gets a mountain of yogurt and then a mountain of toppings).  It's by weight so your portion is not quantized--kind of annoying for the odd amounts of change if you pay in cash, but it's great that it's flexible and completely customizable.  It's a little bit more expensive than Yogurtland, which is why I would suggest getting mainly their specialty yogurt and minimal fruit/other heavy stuff.  Just a simple sprinkle of nuts adds a nice crunch; top it with the caramelized vanilla wafer and it's as good as a true SF-worthy dessert.\n\nThe ambiance is a small cute store with the cheesy but cute giant happy cup of yogurt, which I always amusingly imagine to be eating itself.  There are a few benches for the seating area and it's generally clean, though the dirty mirror bothers me a lot because we wanted to use it to take a picture and noticed how gross it is.  The soft-serve area is quaint, with flavors written in a classic black chalkboard and a layout that is overall reminiscent of Mario Party.\n\nYou can get flavor samples, but everything I've tried tastes exactly as you imagine.  They are named quite well and also categorized by fattiness (non-fat, low-fat, medium, full fat--it goes without saying, the fattier the tastier).  They also combine machines so you can get swirls!  The vanilla and Vietnamese coffee are great together, but unfortunately the Vietnamese coffee is decaf.  The full-fat custard and chocolate custard are like those delicious soft-serves at Souplantation/Sweet Tomatoes.  The salted caramel dog (or whatever it's called... not sure why there's the word dog in there) is not very salted and closer to a caramel frappucino but still good.  That's everything I've tried so far, but expect to see updates... many many updates.  Gotta try 'em all!\n\nLastly, they have stamp cards!  Yet another marking of a go-to P:", "author": "Edna C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-03-23", "description": "Easy Breezy offers more toppings than I've ever seen at any other frozen yogurt shop. The freshly-cut fruit and popping boba glitter like gems and all the toppings are organized neatly. Easy Breezy offers general frozen yogurt toppings such as brownie pieces, crushed Oreo cookies, M&Ms, gummy bears, fruit, chocolate malt balls, and crushed nuts. However, their more adventurous topping include bacon bits, olive oil (pairs well with chocolate and sea salt), maple syrup, potato chips, sweet vinegar, and sea salt (a definite must if one enjoys caramel sauce)!\n\nSome of the froyo flavors I've tried are:\n\"Chocolate Milk\" - after one bite of this I was slapped in the face with the childhood nostalgia of drinking a cold glass full of Nesquik chocolate milk. It's not my favorite chocolate flavor, but kudos to the owners for capturing that kind of taste.\n\n\"Vanilla Custard\" - Jesus f****** christ, I cannot get enough of this! I'm serious. Easy Breezy sold out of this flavor one day before I could make it to the shop and I almost cried.  It's not a frozen yogurt at all but rather a dense, creamy magical concoction with just the right hit of vanilla. This flavor is my favorite and I buy it every time I walk into the shop.\n\n\"Salted Caramel Turtle\" - This is the second-best tasting flavor that I've tried. It tastes like salted caramel with a bit of cocoa. One of the dashingly handsome employees told me that salt was accidentally added to the caramel turtle flavor recipe that they were trying to make that morning, but it resulted in such a delicious outcome!\n\n\"Peanut Butter\" - it's not as heavy as one would expect from something containing peanut butter. The flavor was bold, but not overwhelming to the palate.\n\n\"Lemon Squeezy\" - sweet, tart, and good for a hot day.\nMy favorite thing to eat is the vanilla custard topped with fresh strawberries, brownie pieces, crushed almonds, caramel sauce, and a light sprinkle of sea salt on top.\n\nI wish that I lived closer to its location, but I've visited so frequently that a few of the employees even know me by name! Romlo and Victoria were happy to answer any of the questions about froyo ingredients that I threw at them, and when I didn't see my beloved brownie pieces amongst the other toppings Romlo fetched me some from the kitchen right away. \n\nEasy Breezy is very clean and has a welcoming atmosphere. The background music is good (not overplayed pop music from the radio, thankfully) and it's played at a volume such that I can have a conversation with someone and not be bothered by it. It's a great place to get dessert from or grab a quick snack with friends.\n\nMy only complaint would be about the shop's layout. The froyo machines are located are located towards the back, but the majority of the toppings are on an island in the middle of the shop and the sauces and additional toppings are located next to the cashier desk. The customers bump into each other a bit as they navigate through the different stations. If you're looking for a place to study or hang out you'll have better luck elsewhere; the tables are so tiny that there's barely enough room to put a book on them!", "author": "Mikana C."}

The yogurt is always so melty when you pour it; it doesn't last more than a minute before your cup looks like soup. The exception to this is the custard (which, let's be honest, is effing amazing), but it's full fat and sort of defeats the purpose of getting fro yo, rather than walking to Holy Gelato (which is way cheaper). \n\nAnd the big kicker? It's ridiculously expensive. When I go with my partner, it's $15 minimum for the two of us (and usually closer to $18). We always get the smallest cups and they aren't even full. I don't know the cost per ounce but would guess it's at least 2-3 times that of other yogurt shops.

That being said, it is really, really, really expensive and the flavors they choose for the non-dairy froyo are not well though out.  Two of the smallest size froyo with no toppings $15.70.  That is really expensive!...Just saying.  \n\nRegarding the flavors of the non-dairy froyo;\nFirst I have to say, I am lactose intolerant, so I cannot eat froyo unless it is non-dairy.  I'm not actually sure why anyone would choose to eat non-dairy froyo if they can have dairy.  Almost 3 times a week I walk by and check out what the non-dairy flavors are, and I'm always disappointed and confused by the choices.\n\n  I am a big fan of classic flavors like chocolate, vanilla, etc.  And given that they have 2 non-dairy flavors you'd think that they would choose flavors that go together and are different from each other.  I have asked them why they never have chocolate, they say it's because they always have a dairy version of chocolate.  So, that would be great if I could eat dairy, but I can't.  Easy Breezy, please make non-dairy froyo in flavors that sound good when mixed like chocolate and peanut butter instead of candy cane with lavender, or red velvet cake with lemon meringue or vietnamese coffee and grapefruit!?!

After he listed them for me I named one and asked him to get me the smallest size. He asked them for a small.\n\nApparently, the people working there spontaneously decided that this was 'about a quart'. So they filled up a quart container, and then explained that the yogurt was 'sold by weight' and that this weight was $9.00. When he objected, and requested a smaller size, they demanded that since he had ordered it, he had to pay for it.\n\nI thereby acquired $9.00 worth of poor quality yogurt. What I wanted was a small cup of frozen yogurt that should cost about... $3.50... at most. What I and my helpful roommate received instead... was abusive. The entire situation was upsetting and simply wrong.\n\nThis business clearly has no concern whatsoever about their customers and is willing to use deceptive tactics to manipulate them.

That being said, even the smallest cups are huge, which trick you into dispensing yourself more than you might have gotten with a price sticker in front of you. For two of the smallest cups that were each not nearly full, my friend and I rung up over $14. They charge something like 68\u00a2 an oz, which comes out to almost $11 per pound. I guess you're paying for the variety of  toppings.\nThere's ample seating, with five or six small tables inside and four benches outside. Overall, a nice experience, but pricy!

Right after I had purchased my frozen yogurt I had somewhat regretted getting it.\n\nEasy Breezy is presented in a fun colorful way. The interior has a lot of teal along with a lot of wood grain. What's nice is that they clearly state allergens for each of their yogurt flavors. I had gotten a swirl of dark chocolate and cookies-n-cream. Easy Breezy uses coconut milk in their dark chocolate. I can definitely taste it. I think I may like the cookies-n-cream more. It's not the flavor that bothers me, it's the texture. It's way too icy for my tastes. For some reason this frozen yogurt melts incredibly fast. The toppings bar is standard fare.

Despite having lived in the sunset for seven months and taking the N pretty much every day, I didn't try Easy Breezy until about a month ago.

I think this is the first place I've ever seen potato chips offered as topping. The cookie dough is made without eggs and the berries are fresh.\n\nThe only thing I don't love about it is the layout of the store, which can be really crowded on sunny days.

I love that it is pay by the ounce and you get to add your own toppings, compared to many other yogurt places that you are stuck with whatever they give you.  \n\nThere are a bunch of reviews talking about the price.  Personally, I think it is far cheaper than most yogurt places I've been to.  The two times I've been here it is about $3-4 for a normal sized portion.  At a similar national yogurt chain it would probably cost $4-6 for the same size.  I do agree that if you don't know what you are doing it can be a little confusing when you walk in, but it's a brand new place and I'm sure the owners and employees will work to make the flow a little easier.", "author": "Colin W."}

I strongly believe that no matter how full you are, there is ALWAYS room for froyo and/or ice cream.\n\nThat being said, Easy Breezy's froyo is THE best. The full-fat vanilla and chocolate flavors made with custard is well worth the additional fat and cals. Every time I've gone, they always have those flavors plus tart and a vanilla option. The others change depending on the season, there's usually one made with coconut milk, one with almond milk? It just depends. \n\nThe other day I went in and they had cake batter and apple pie flavor. The apple pie tasted like legit apple pie...in a froyo. I don't know how else to better explain. \n\nOrganic ingredients and a much needed addition to the neighborhood! Make sure to get your stamp card! I would also agree with other Yelpers in that prices are in line with Fraiche (another must try, I may add!) but you pay-per-ounce. \n\nPro-tip: Make sure you line your froyo cravings when Hardly Strictly is NOT going on.

To my very pleasant surprise, the Pistachio frozen yogurt here was not too green, a little gritty in texture, and had a nutty undertone. All of this made me feel confident that real nuts were involved in the production process. The Easy Breezy Lemon Squeeze was refreshing, light, & tasted like real lemons; I could have used a little more pucker though. No first trip to a frozen yogurt parlor is complete without trying the Plain. The texture was good but it was not as tart as I have had at other places.\n\nThe prices are a little higher than other frozen yogurt establishments in the area, but given the superior flavor & the quality ingredients, I am happy to splurge...although probably on s often as I used to.", "author": "Karen S."}

Like every Friday. Apple pie with graham cracker topping one Friday. Plain vanilla with cookie bits today. Love this stuff. If it lasted long enough to take home I would be in trouble.

This is a tiny self-serve yogurt shop with a few benches to sit on in the store front. My favorite is their chocolate custard and it's labeled \"full fat\". It's probably the reason why it was so good! Extremely creamy and chocolatey and perfect temperature! When I say perfect temperature when it comes to froyo, what I mean is its stiff when you pump it into your cup rather than soft and melts quickly. I like mine colder and on the stiffer side. They don't have a whole lot of options for toppings and my complaint is that when it's busy, the topping bar can get really messy and gross. They have a lot of delicious flavors and made from organic ingredients. I will definitely come back for anything that's full fat!

Four are always the same: tart, full-fat custard, fat free vanilla, and low fat chocolate.  The other four more or less rotate weekly.  Tip: check their Facebook page for the flavors of the week, updated every Monday/Tuesday.  My favorite flavors so far have been coffee, pistachio, and peanut butter, especially the latter two.  Hope to see nonfat mint soon\n\nAs of a few weeks ago, one machine has a dedicated nondairy flavor which uses an almond milk base (previously it was a sorbet).  My boyfriend is allergic to dairy (not lactose intolerant) so we are pleased about the change to almond milk, which provides a creamy smoothness that is far more delectable than the old sorbet.  We are however very disappointed that the only flavor had been banana.  Boyfriend hates bananas, I like bananas, but for frozen yogurt, I'll pass. \nWe hope they will have two nondairy flavors with the almond milk base. Would love to see a nondairy version of more popular flavors, such as Very Berry (blueberry and strawberry)\n\nI think they changed the dimensions of the regular cup size, it seems much wider and shorter than before.

A cold, sweet, and creamy bell... you know I had high hopes for this metaphor but it's not working out. Anyhow, the Custard flavor at Easy Breezy tastes exactly like Kohr Bros. frozen custard. One bite brought back vivid memories of warm summer nights strolling along the boardwalk with my family.

Also try the custard flavor with whole milk -its creamy-ness was unbelivable.  Secondly. the selection of toppings were unusually perfect. They had berries, fruit, Oreo cookies, and stuff like shaved Andes mints - not just the usual sprinkles and gummy stuff that most places carry.

I always like to check out yogurt shops in any city I am in. I was so pleasantly surprised it was here. I had no idea it was their first day. I love the high ceilings in wood theme. I love how the Vanilla Custard was labeled \"Full Fat\" since it wasn't really yogurt. I mixed that with the chocolate and a little bit of the Coffee Toffee. They have about 8 flavors and standard toppings to choose from and you can ask for them to give you sample cup before you buy. Everything is based on weight like most places. It's a tad small inside but I would venture to say they will do well in a great, cute, walkable neighborhood of Inner Sunset.

I was SO excited when I heard this place was opening and finally got to try it today. It is pretty good. They have a fairly good selection of yogurt and toppings. It looks like they always have vanilla, chocolate and tart flavors available, and they rotate in a couple of additional fun flavors. There were some toppings I like to get at other places that I didn't see, but there was still good variety. I like that it is high quality and that it is family owned. I have to agree that it is way too expensive though. It's 61 cents per ounce. For comparison, my favorite fro yo place in the city is 43 cents per ounce. They have a much larger selection of toppings and flavors, it's also high quality, and it's on Union Street which I would actually expect to be priced higher than the Inner Sunset. That makes Easy Breezy almost 50% more expensive, which is kind of crazy I think.\n\nI am still happy that we have a frozen yogurt place now, but a little bummed that we still don't have one to replace my other favorites in the city. Will I go back? Yes, every once in a while. It is convenient and yummy. But I definitely won't be visiting as much as I would have otherwise. I'll get my fro yo fix while I'm out and about instead of saving it for when I'm back home. My guess is that this pricing works for their Noe Valley location. I think they'd do more business in our neighborhood if they lowered their price a bit to be more competitive/realistic with what people are used to paying.

The price per ounce is a tad more expensive than other froyo places, though I imagine the rent can't be cheap so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. They did slightly lower their prices over the past couple of weeks so definitely good steps. Their froyo flavors - from what I tried - are really good! And they have a good number of machines! But, and this was my biggest issue, a lot of the times I stop by, some of the machines are out of order! I think the best part of froyo is the number of options of yogurt flavors and toppings you get, but when I came by last time, with MOST of the machines being broken and only three flavors available - it just killed my desire for froyo.

They have their regular flavors (ex: vanilla custard, vanilla bean, original tart, etc), then they have flavors they change EVERY Monday.  My first time I had their Mango Lassi & Original Tart.  Original Tart....not much to say only that it's tart.  Mango Lassi tasted familiar, exactly like the Kasugai Japanese gummy candy.  THIS time: sampled almost all their new flavors and the one I found most unique: Mint Mojito.  I enjoyed the light, refreshing taste of actual fresh mint.  Not overpowering whatsoever.  It's unique in that they're the first to add real mint leaves to yogurt.  This flavor definitely should be enjoyed alone and on an empty palette.  The light mint flavors really come out nicely. Taro...a bit too sweet, but that's because I prefer taro soft, savory, and made Chinese-style.\n\nAfter sampling the new flavors, I decided on one new flavor, one \"regular\" flavor: peanut butter & vanilla bean.  One of the workers said she had been working hard to mix the peanut butter into the yogurt so I gave it a try.  Perhaps I, next time, will do a different mix. Peanut butter, being peanut butter, overpowered the vanilla bean, and therefore, causing vanilla bean to seem flavorless.  All I tasted was peanut butter & \"bland\" yogurt.  Don't get me wrong, vanilla is typically light in flavor so blending a strong flavor and very light flavors of course the stronger of the 2 shall win.\nThey have a nice variety of toppings, of which mochi & strawberry are my go-to.  I noticed they have bacon, but will try this on another day.\n\nOk, long review but please bear with me.  Shop doesn't have a lot of seating, but it is cozy & clean; the wall color & awning are cute & inviting.  There are benches outside to enjoy your fro-yo and chill.  I love that this shop is located ONLY in SF.  2 locations: one on Irving & one on Castro (in the Noe Valley district).  I hope this stays only in SF.  My question is if a changing flavor becomes popular,  will they repeat their weekly-changing flavor?", "author": "Jessica S."}

I had their low-fat chocolate milk flavored yogurt, piled up with wonderful toppings. For example, sensational caramel chocolate turtle chunks. Amazing.", "author": "Emily H."}

The last time I was there I got snickerdoodle and it was SO GOOD. My friends got it too and they said it was their favorite even though they tried the mango flavor, regular tart, and nutella. Can't go wrong with the other flavors either and I love that it's always changing!", "author": "Gina N."}

They have a bunch of different toppings but I didn't get any this time. I'll definitely be back, though. The owner (or who I think is the owner.. lol) is super friendly.", "author": "Melissa C."}

Nothing. Service? Amazing. I'm not sure if its his name, but one male worker who looks like Robert DeNiro works there, greets me with \"Hello, welcome to Easy Breezy\", and I feel happy inside. I believe his name is Romolo, and he is fantastic. If you want to be treated like a king, go to this place and talk with Romolo, he'll give you a good time. BEST PLACE I HAVE EVER BEEN TO IN MY LIFE HANDS DOWN, BETTER THAN COITIS AND BETTER THAN LOVE.", "author": "Marcello W."}
