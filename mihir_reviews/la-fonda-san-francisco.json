I am looking at pictures of other people's tortas and that is not what we got;  no lettuce, no cheese, no tomato, no avocado. Kid reported that she had to ask for them to please give us jalapenos and was told they were 'too spicy.' She said she had to insist, and in the end got them on the side, so we put them in the torta ourselves. That was weird. I kind of wish she had insisted on all of the vegetables and a toasted bun too, but I guess after the difficulty getting jalapenos she gave up. \n\nThe huevos rancheros were fine, with a tiny sprinkling of cheese.

I've only eaten here twice, both recently, but I've enjoyed my meals here.  The staff is nice, the restaurant is clean, the portions are filling and the food is very good.\n\nA big bowl of complimentary chips come with each meal and you can help yourself at the iced down salsa bar which features two types of red sauce, a tomatillo sauce (my favorite), whole jalapenos, chopped onion and chopped cilantro.\n\nOn my first visit I had an enchilada plate with chorizo (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GPK6hwD_EGKCRVD1cWESig?select=w_ny-F33_YCddhpWBQL5fQ).  They offer you a choice of beans and I chose the black beans which is my default choice.  The enchiladas here are not rolled but are actually just meat inside a tortilla folded over like a taco and smothered in cheese and enchilada sauce.  The chorizo was very good with just a tad of kick.  I prefer more spice and found one of the red sauces in the salsa bar perfect for developing a little moisture on my forehead.  A small side of fresh, chunky guacamole is served on the side.  The guac here combines ripe avocado with chunks of fresh tomatoes and chopped onions.  It, too, was very good.\n\nOn my second visit I decided to try La Fonda's version of a wet burrito.  More often than not I tend to like my Mexican food smothered in cheese or smothered in sauce so whenever I dine in the chances are fairly high that I will order something smothered in cheese or sauce.  In this case my Azteca Burrito was smothered with both (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GPK6hwD_EGKCRVD1cWESig?select=JwWhOT74QTXoIYrC81Cslg).  I ordered it with broiled steak and whole black beans.  The steak is precooked, chopped and reheated on the grill upon ordering.  The preparation time was very fast even with a steady flow of customers coming in.  The modified enchilada sauce had some nice spice to it and the burrito was overstuffed and wrapped up plump.\n\nFor hydration La Fonda carries many of your favorite beers and they have several varieties of agua frescas.  For me though I like that they have Mexican Coke and several varieties of Jarritos Mexican soda.\n\nFor excellent Mexican food you can find me somewhere in the Mission, but if I'm in the Inner Sunset and I feel like having above average Mexican food then La Fonda is my preferred choice.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

It's an order-and-pickup-at-the-counter sort of place, so I'm not really sure what the problem could be, except that maybe some people expect a counter person to kiss their ass a little bit while they deliberate over whether or not to get that burrito wrapped in a plain or spinach tortilla.", "author": "Gopal R."}

The menu is pretty standard for a Mexican restaurant and the prices are pretty fair.  It's not as cheap as some other Mexican restaurants, but it's by no means pricey.  \n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered a couple things to share:\n-Chips (free): nothing special, but I still liked them.\n\n-Super carne asada burrito (about $7.50):pretty large for one person to finish unless you're really hungry.  You get your choice of meat and beans.  It wasn't as hot as I would have liked, but it was fine.  The portion of meat was very fair, but the flavor of it was just okay.  \n\n-Special item (I think it was called cachula or something?) ($3.95): this was pretty interesting.  It was some spicy pork and pink onions sandwiched between two thick corn tortilla type pieces.  (I know that description wasn't that great, but it tasted pretty good).  I've never had this anywhere else before, but it was one of the specials, on a printed sign by the cash register.  My boyfriend really enjoyed the pork and we both thought it tasted good.  The weird thing is that we both had two intensely spicy bites from the dish- but the rest was only mildly spicy.\n\nOverall, the restaurant was really clean and the service was fine.  They call the name of the dish/item out when it's ready, so make sure that you're listening.  I'll probably be back at some point to try out other dishes.  \n\nNotes:\n-It seems like they do a lot of to-go business.\n-Self-serve salsa bar (3 types of salsa, onions, cilantro and peppers).\n-Self-serve water station.", "author": "Samantha L."}

The quesadilla was for my gf and she said it was not too bad and was happy with the available option of a wheat tortilla. For me on the other hand I did not enjoy my burrito and finished about half of it before throwing it away. A big deal breaker for me is fat in my meat, I had to spit out the meat 2 times in a span of three bites due to large chunks of fat in my burrito, this is not only disgusting but ruins your appetite since your analyzing every bite from that moment on to check out if there is fat or not.

I had as my main entree the super vegetarian burrito which (at the time of this writing) was under $6 and it's medium size was a good value for what you're getting. The refried beans had flavor and seemed like they cared about vegetarian needs. They also had a large menu of other vegetable burritos which made me want to come back and try those.

The chicken the mole covered was delicious - tender and juicy. The sopas were also pretty yummy. And my hubby's cochinita pork was delish. The salsas are fresh and the horchata was pleasant.\n\nOverall, ok experience. I would eat here again, but I would skip the mole.", "author": "Yelena K."}

The first few years I would have rated it 5 stars, but in the last couple of years it seems the ownership have shown a total lack of interest in keeping this restaurant successful.\n\nI usually order the cochinita super burrito, with chips and salsa on the side, and a Mexican coke. Then I liked to sit outside on sunny days and enjoy the people walking by as I ate. There was also a really sweet lady that use to work behind the counter, I think she lived on 8th Ave., the same block that I did at the time. She would always smile and chat a little, and I felt welcome like there was a true neighborhood vibe about this place.\n\nSo here's my experience in the last couple years:\n\nNo more chairs and tables outside, I guess the city didn't want them on the sidewalk anymore, but I wonder why the owners did not apply for a parklet seeing as this would be a great benefit to their customers? Many cafes, restaurants, etc., have been putting them in all over the city, and the program is great! \n\nAfter many years the nice lady that worked the counter is not there anymore, and the new ones are not friendly at all, some even have a grumpy attitude like they are doing you a favor to take your order. Maybe they don't get paid as well anymore, but I always tip them no matter what.\n\nThe decor of the place is badly in need of maintenance, the planter outside is beat, the window frames and walls are damaged, and need painted, hardwood floors need refinished, lights are out and dirty, and the whole place needs a deep cleaning and degreasing. It just looks grubby and not kept up like a food serving establishment should be.\n\nLastly, and most importantly, the food. I have noticed a sharp decrease in portion size on my super burrito, I don't know if that is the person making it, or the owner has told them to take it down a couple notches to save money? Also the chip portions are now smaller too. I used to walk out of here stuffed, sometimes couldn't even finish and would save some for later, but not anymore. I felt like the super burrito has become the normal burrito and was missing the extras that I payed for.\n\nWake up La Fonda, don't let things slide much further, it's obvious. I won't be going back until I notice some changes for the better.", "author": "Aaron C."}

I got a burito and the carne asada was ok, the rice beans size ok. I can't say terrible things about them or terribly great.

When it comes to food though, La Fonda and Papa Lote are miles apart... \n\nFIrst the good.  The chips are very good - deep fried but not too oily and not too thick or thin.  The red salsa was also excellent, some sort of smoked tomato salsa with tanginess and a kick.  The chilaquiles we had were overall OK but had a fantastic red sauce (different from the red salsa) - would love to see if they make that themselves of buy it from the outside.  FInally, the chile relleno was pretty tasty - nothing too unique, just an overload of cheese and pepper, but tasty nonetheless. \n\nAnd now for the bad.  The shrimp fajitas were pretty throughly terrible, with under-cooked shrimp (too crunchy and fishy) and that lacked any flavor - I feel like they should have either made them much richer (with butter/oil) or spicier (garlic or chipotle or even just salt/pepper), but apparently they chose neither.  In both dishes we ordered the rice and pinto beans were both also very bland, which pretty much seals the deal on this place - a burrito place with bad rice and beans is like watch that can't keep time, all style and no substance.  \n\nAll in all a star for the salsa and chips, a second for the awesome chilaquiles red sauce...and that's it.", "author": "Rosers M."}

And on a warmish day, it gets really hot inside.  I hope they make enough money to expand (or move to a little bigger space but stay in the neighborhood).  This time I opted for a taco al pastor, guacamole, and a cheese handmade corn quesadilla.  I've never even seen a taco al pastor so I can't say whether it was \"correct\" or not but it was very tasty, reminded me of the tacos we got down on the beach in Mexico, simple but tasty.  I could have put some of the salsas I took but I liked it as it was (don't need to scorch my tastebuds with hot sauce in order to eat it, was good as it was).  But it didn't look like the meat was sliced off one of those rotating meat skewers, looked like chopped pork.  I'm going to go back for more soon.  The guacamole was fine, lots of tomatoes in it which I'm not used to (seems like all the Mexican places are doing different things to \"extend\" their guacamole, some are chopping up lots of ciilantro and parsley, some are putting lots of onions and other stuff in there, once place overdid it with too much lemon) but we did eat it all.  And I loved the corn tortilla quesadiilas--nice taste and texture (better then the regular wheat ques you get at other taquerias).  Their fish tacos are just ok, I'll haul down to Rubio's when I have a fish taco jones (love their Mahi Mahi tacos)--but La Fonda's are about on a par with Pacific Catch over on 9th-Lincoln and not so expensive.  It is a different taste from your average taqueria, just wish the place were a bit bigger and didn't get so bleeding hot on warm days.  Oh, yea, and I don't care that they only give you a handful of chips, I don't come here to fill up on chips, I come for the real food.  I will need to attempt to get up earlier so I can taste their breakfast fare or else ask them if they serve breakfast all day long.  Oh, yea again, I trucked over to Church St. to try La Castillito's tacos al pastor and although they were good, I like La Fonda's a little bit better--less \"sweet\" (I'm not into sweet tasting foods).

The clerk at the front smiled and nodded approvingly. \n\nIn about 5 minutes the burrito was wrapped and glistening in foil. \n\nIt was ready to roll.\n\n\"Red\" grabbed the burrito and headed out. \n\nBefore she had taken two steps she began to smell wafts of warmed rice and sniffed the silver burrito lump. She promised her stomach that they would be home soon, but her stomach had it's own agenda.\n\nIt grumbled. It tightened. And kept on nagging. \"Come on....puh-lease... just one small bite.\" Despite attempts to ignore her badgering stomach, she couldn't.  She unwrapped a corner of the tightly bound bundle and took one little nibble.\n\nIt was delicious. Warm tofu in a sweet red sauce, wrapped in flavored rice, with cheese, guacomole and lettuce. Taste explosion. She folded down the tinfoil and put the burrito back in it's bag. But it kept on calling her name.\n\n\"Ohhhhhhhhhhh Reeeeeedddddddddddd. You know you want me. Come on now...just one little bite. Lil nibble never hurt no one.\"\n\nHer stomach began to squirm at the incessant burrito taunting. But she just pulled her belt tighter and kept on walking. Burrito still in the bag. But the burrito taunts got louder and louder, as did her stomach, struggling to move beneath her tightened jeans.\n\nShe stopped and looked at the burrito hard. \"Fine! Just one more bite\"\n\nThe tortilla puckered in delight.\n\nAnd she took one bite. Bigger than before. She could taste the melted cheese and it danced in her mouth. Her eyelashes fluttered and her stomach squealed in delight. \"Oooooooo  just one more bite. Come on now...You can save the rest for America's Next Top Model tonight\" It made sense. She took one slightly bigger bite - this time she could taste the guacamole. The burrito grinned. Red was his. All his. \n\n \nShe'd only walked a block now, but already there was guacomole all over her face, the red sauce dribbled down her left cheek. People on the street stared at her in both disgust and bewilderemet.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-11-17", "description": "With this tough economy and diners being more selective about the value of eating out, you would expect restaurants to make an extraordinary effort to cater to the dwindling throng.  Many restaurants are offering coupons or other gimmicks to lure customers.  These restaurants are probably on the verge as really successful ones don't need to do this.   La Fonda offers coupons, but their attitude indicates indifference to its customers.\n\nIt is been awhile since I came here, probably since my first review which I gave it two stars.  Last night we decided to eat here again for two reasons.  First, we had some coupons to use and secondly we were in the neighborhood.\n\nThere were 3 persons working there, a female cashier, a female preparer, and a male in the back.  The cashier seemed very friendly and attentive. It wasn't very busy. It looked like they added additional items to their menu. The condiments were full and it seemed relatively clean.  However, they let the once beautiful oak floors turn grimy.  All of the polyurethane was worn out and the oak color was turning black.  It looked gross.\n\nWe ordered a super beef burrito ($8) and a chili relleno dinner ($9).  The portions were huge and we took them upstairs to eat.  I cut into my burrito and took a bite and it was cold!  The cook did not bother to heat it up, just slap it together, rolled it up and flopped it on the plate.  I don't mean it was lukewarm - it was cold.  I could not distinguish what was in the burrito - it looked like a bunch of mushy tasteless glop.   My companion said her dinner was \"okay\" as she is not very critical.  The chips that came with our meals were leathery and I nearly cracked my filling eating it. \n\nThere was another Mexican restaurant near 6th/Irving that use to serve cold burritos also.  It has shrunk to a shell of its former self with much of its space occupied by a middle eastern restaurant.  La Fonda is heading in the same direction.\n\nLa Fonda has not taken any progressive steps to improve themselves and the quality of food has certainly gone downhill.  Maybe that are confident that their customers don't care about the slop they serve and feel they have a monopoly in the area.  Certainly, I don't want to go back here again, no matter how many coupons they offer.  If anyone can recommend a better place in the area, I'd like to know.

Next time I go back, I'll ask for three of them and I'll be even happier than I was than when I ate the standard serviing of two.\n\nThe other dish I've had was a regular mole burrito, with pinto beans, rice, and hot sauce. Mole was dark and rich, and better than most mole I've had (and that's a lot), however I think I prefer L'Avenida's mole just a tiny bit more on account of it being a bit lighter and less rich.\n\nComparing L'Avenida to La Fonda on points other than the mole, I give L'Avenida points for being a hole in the wall, for the fact that you get better service when you can order in Spanish, which is always something I love as an indicator that you're about to eat really good food. Salsa is a toss up between the two with both being good in my book. Those points aside, La Fonda edges out L'Avenida by a hair in my book on account of the much bigger menu and the fact that I can actually fit my legs under the tables. \n\nBut that said, I'll be happy eating at either and after just moving to the Sunset, I'm sure I'll be eating at one or the other basically every week.", "author": "Chris S."}

I was with my girlfriend and came in around 9:00 pm on a Sunday night.\n\nThe restaurant itself was very quaint, and it even had an upstairs area for dining. Although the downstairs (where the counter and \"kitchen\" is) was a bit cramped, the food that the two women made that night was really solid. I ordered a steak fajita burrito and my girlfriend ordered flautas. \n\nOur food was out within ten minutes (there was probably 3 or 4 other couples in there) and the portions that they gave were generous. Our meals combined were less than $20 including a drink and we both really enjoyed our food. The burrito I had was larger than I expected it would be, and my girlfriend's food filled up her entire plate. We were both full by the end of dinner. \n\nin addition to the food and overall good aesthetics of the restaurant, they had a small salsa bar at the end of the counter in which you could fill up a little cup full of any of the different salsas they offered.

I am a fan of Balazo, \"hey, what the heck?\" \n\nWhen I came in, I was pleased to see the Latino staff, that was the first good sign. Also, the menu offered lots of Mexican specialties that are often left off most Mexican-American restaurants such as sopes and huaraches. As a vegetarian, one of the first things I notice is how well the restaurant caters to the non-flesh eaters. It looks like they had several burrito options, and one included this strange tomatoey tofu. The gracious attendant gave me a sample, which was for the best, because I would not have been happy had the tofu made its way into my burro. \n\nI went with the super veggie burrito and sope without meat. They were both tasty, standard Mexican fare. Pleasing to the taste buds, but nothing to get excited about.

We ended up at La Fonda. Let's just get to the review.\n\nThe Good:\n\nThe food was decent and they had a fairly nice selection. The restaurant, while small, was kept up well. I had the shrimp and barbacoa tacos and some nachos. The barbacoa was nice but the shrimp and nachos were sub-par. \n\nThe Bad:\n\nTHE STAFF! Holy crap. The lady taking our order was rude and didn't appear to be listening half of the time. I think we had to repeat my friend's order twice. Their way of serving food is poorly thought out as well. They just hand you a tray and don't tell you that they will just call out your dish so that you can walk back up to pick it up. Kinda confusing but okay. Also, no free refills. REALLY!? Very rarely do you find a place that will charge for refills anymore and to me, that's just a joke. They lost a star solely on that little tidbit. \n\nConclusion:\n\nNormally I would give this place another shot! Occasionally you get a bad dish or you have to go a few times to find the real gems at a restaurant, but this place wont get that opportunity. Unless they have a serious talk with their staff and get with the times on their drink policies (which, in my mind, is just a form of fleecing), you wont see me back there.", "author": "Jonathan R."}

The prices aren't terribly high, but  a bit higher than what I would like to pay for Mexican food that, to me, isn't anything special. \n\nWe usually get take out here and when you order, it's not like Gordo's where you say what you want and they make it on the spot. They write it all down and then make it. \n\nThe ambiance is nice though. You have the downstairs and upstairs to eat and on a sunny day, i recommend sitting right next to their window. It makes you feel very warm and joyful eating by the window with a few of your close friends and family. \n\nThey actually have quite a variety on their menu. It includes burritos, tacos, nachos, sandwiches, plates, etc. I usually get their burritos are the portions are pretty big. If you finish one regular burrito you'll be stuffed. There's a good variety of meats, but the meats aren't anything special. I also thing their burritos are a bit dry, where Gordo's is juicier. For good burritos though, you'll probably have to go to the mission. A good thing about La Fonda is that they usually give you a complimentary bad of tortilla chips and they have a salsa bar where you pick your own salsa. I don't recommend that dark red one though. \n\nI'd check this place out if you wanted to try a Mexican restaurant with some variety in their menus and want a nice pleasant setting to set in while eating.", "author": "robin w."}

Somehow all americans think that Mexican food is all burritos. Its not. \n\nIn Mexico, we dont even have burritos... anywhere. A burrito is like a made up American thing. Just like chilli and all those other nasty fake mexican meals. So calling this place \"inauthentic\" or a \"burrito joint\" is ignorant and stupid.\n\nAs a Mexican i can actually say that this place is as authentic as it can get in the US. The sopes are amazing, the huaraches are delicious and the salsas actually taste like something. Of course they make them a little light tasting but thats only because Americans cant handle the spicyness and complain too much.\n\nThe molletes are done different then they are done in mexico but still, they are incredibly delicious. Their veggies are fresh and their aguas frescas taste home made and not like canned juices.\n\nGordos is a mexican fast food place that scores a 1 compared to la fonda. which BTW. its LAH PHONe DAH. not law fawnduh. it doesnt even SOUND like lawfawnduh. \n\nof course its hard to find real mexican food here cuz well.. there isnt. you want mexican food. real mexican food?

I blame this on the North Beach dieters, Pilates loons, and health club nincompoops around the world. It's a little known fact that bacon is the greatest and most delicious meat in the universe. \n\nThe number one reason for its greatness is its versatility. You can have 2 strips of crispy bacon with your eggs in the morning, chopped up in a nice albeit womanly salad, wrapped around a scallop and eaten while on ecstasy, or, the way La Fonda does it--layed across onions, peppers, and meat, and wrapped in a flour tortilla--the wonder that is \"The Alambre\". \n\nIf you question the authenticity of this dish, then you my friend, have obviously never been to Mexico, where they kill and eat pigs on a daily basis and have no running water or electricity. I believe the main character in Desperado, the cinematic authority on Mexico, ate an Alambre whilst killing, playing guitar, and talking to Steve Buscemi. But, I digress.

While most  places try and emulate style of little side of the road taco stands, La Fonda does not.  Rather, it is more like the tacos you get in chi-chi Mexico City taquerias that are frequented by fresas, but in a good way.\n\nWhile most places have to stick to the one or two meats that they do best, la fonda has a wide variety that are all very flavorful, and not over the top.  They don't do anything perfect, but they do most very well.  It is one of the few places that I don't really use the salsa, because I usually order the cochinita or the mole, and I want to enjoy the flavor of the meat itself.  On the tacos it is especially nice because they use very good tortillas. Also, they make the best sopes I have had in a long time.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are great places in the Mission, but La Fonda does what it is trying to do as well as anywhere in the city.\n\nAs a final word, La Fonda stands out in terms of its service.  The people that work there seem genuinely nice, and that combined with how pleasant the space is makes it a really nice eat-in experience.", "author": "Nicholas E."}

This is one of his top rated burrito...the super burrito.  Unfortunately, I ordered before him, as did a few of my other friends and missed the memo.  Apparently you MUST order the super burrito GRILLED AND IN FOIL.  My burrito (with Carnitas) was sloppy, wet, and actually kinda cold.  I think the foil and grilled-ness would've taken care of these problems.  My friends who ordered AFTER the burrito eater benefited from his vast experiences and ordered the right way.  They LOVED their burritos.\n\nAnother note, we sat upstairs (there is very little seatng in this place) and right above the kitchen.  We were inhaling smoke for a good hour and reeked afterwards.

You have a great selection of bars and cafes, novelty shops, and even bakeries.  Until La Fonda arrived, you had one choice: Gordo's.  Now don't get me wrong, Gordo's is tasty.  I had been going there since high school.  I was partial to it, I admit.  Then one evening after a few drinks at Yancy's, me and my friend realized we were in the mood for a burrito, but didn't want to walk those one and half blocks to Gordo's.  And so we discovered La Fonda.\n\nThe selection of meats and tortillas is much better here.  All the meats have more flavor, and even without the spicy salsa, you can feel the burn, if that is what you're into (which I am).  \n\nThe staff are super friendly, and are happy to tweak your burrito in anyway.  There is always seating, either upstairs or downstairs.  They also have a great selection of fresh salsas and jalapenos.

There are die-hard fans of both. Personally, I don't think either are as good as the places you'll find in the Mission. But hey, that's across town and sometimes us Sunset-dwellers get burrito cravings but don't have time to hoof it over there. \n\nSo which to go to? I'm a La Fonda fan... it seems less authentic than Gordos, but in a healthier way. This is the type of place where you can choose your tortilla (spinach, sun-dried tomato, etc...) But the quality of the ingredients is better, and you can still get out of there for very little money. When I'm feeling indulgent, I ask them to add shrimp to a steak super burrito.

I ordered a cuban torta and while the cook is making it I notice a red sausage or something like that. Once I received my food, I found that it was extremly big. I took a bite out of the torta and oh man what a nasty taste. The meat is supposed to be very thin, mine was really thick and chewy. A few more things that I did not like was the cheese they used. It's supposed to be mexican cheese not chedder. Taking a closer look at the sandwich i noticed the \"red sausage\" and took a bite of it, it was a damn hotdog frank, I've never eaten a cuban torta with a hotdog frank in it. My partner ordered a quesadilla and it was also the worst tasting quesadilla EVER.... We should of kept the original place we were going too \"Gordos\" instead of this disgusting place.

I decided to try it instead of going with my usual Gordo's order. I went in, ordered the Super Nachos and a Corona, and then was told my bill was over $13. As I was paying it, I realized that was pretty steep, considering the nachos were a little over $6 and the beer was $3. I asked the woman why it was so expensive and she looked at me like I was a cheapskate. Another man came over and gave me the same look. Finally they called the person who I assume was the manager over, and he printed the receipt and looked at me like I was crazy. As I took a look at the receipt I realized the woman charged me for two beers. The manager refunded my money, but acted as though I didn't fairly deserve it. The first back thing to happen in the place.\n\nThen my food was horrible. The beans were bad. The chicken gross. They heated up the sour cream. The guacamole was disgusting.

This order came with complementary chips and salsa.  The burrito was decent but everything had the same texture so it tasted kind of mushy.  The portion was great though and I saved 1/2 for lunch the next day.  The horchata, however, was amazing and not too sweet which is my pet peeve!  Yum!! Definitely a must order.  The chips and salsa were definitely disappointing.  The chips were not really good at all and there were only like 3 salsa options, each of which was really watery.  The tomatillo salsa was good but I tend to like salsas that are on the more chunky side.  I'd definitely come back because the price is good and the staff is nice, but its not a place that I would go out of my way to go eat at.", "author": "Andrea F."}

The entire menu looked great but I ended up going with the Veggie Burritto which consists of beans (you choose b/w refried, black, and pinto - I went with refried, yum!), rice (spanish rice! not nasty white steamed rice like Chipotle), salsa, and cheese. I asked them to add guacamole into the burrito. It was delicious! Unlike a lot of burrito places, the portion size was filling, yet manageable. I tried out the milder side salsa as well as the salsa verde and both were delicious - the verde was a bit spicier than the red salsa I got. They also give you a side of tortilla chips with your meal. Definitely worth a try and satisfied a recent craving I've been having for some quality mexican food.", "author": "Megan B."}

And as far as the quality of the food, I continue to be seriously curious how anybody can rate this place as good!  This time I tried their chicken mole and have to say it was a laughable attempt at this dish.  Saying the flavor was one-dimensional would be a overly generous.

The meat is high quality, I've never noticed any gristle or yuck to it and it had lots of flavor.  I've noticed a trend towards sauce-y burritos-- not a bad thing, just that the meat/gauc/sour cream/salsa combo here makes a nice mixed up combination that soaks into the rice and tortilla a lot.

For me, it's hard to Fuck up a burrito, but once I saw La Fonda and ate there, I knew Gordos had been doing just that.  After eating a gazillion burritos at countless Mexican places over the last fifteen years, I can say that La Fondas rad as hell... and cheap too.  I can bust out of there with a belly full of veggie burrito for under five bucks.  Five stars.", "author": "David V."}

I should qualify that by saying my pronouncement comes  solely from the super burrito al pastor. Gordo's and l'Avenida were not as good as La Fonda which beat them by far in the al pastor super burrito category.", "author": "Snora E."}

The tamales, however, were really good! Now, I do want to mention to the foodies out there that they do microwave already refirgerated tamales, but from how long tamales take to make from my understanding, I don't blame them. The microwaving didn't seem to detract from the flavor at all and there were no hot and cold patches. The portions were huge with 2 tamales, full helping of rice and beans and a small salad. Yum!", "author": "Jennifer D."}

Oh, I know... how about NOT charging me for the sour cream that I ask for on the side?!!  Aside from this minor gripe, I have nothing negative to say about this cute little authentic-looking Mexi place so close to my house.  Clean and colorful interior (with high ceilings so you don't go out smelling like Taco Bell, THANK GOD!) and quick friendly service, and the food... well the tofu taco that I ordered was very delicious, with the tofu being just the right texture (very firm) and perfectly seasoned without being too salty.  And the black beans were scrumptious as well.  So yes, a simple but wonderfully delicious $2.20 taco is going to entice me to come back to this place, in spite of the stinginess with the sour cream.  My next target will be trying their \"Tofu Ranchero\" burrito... should be interesting.  Also, I'm sure the restaurant owners did not intend this when they named their business, but I can't help but crack up every time I'm reminded of how much this restaurant almost shares the same name as a Napoleon Dynamite character.
