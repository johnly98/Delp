It is very small inside with only 10-15 tables. For our group of 6 they put two tables together. \n\nWe tried a variety of entrees and dumplings. The pea shoots with garlic are very tasty as was the eggplant with garlic. It definitely had spice but was not so hot that I didn't like it (I can't stomach food is too spicy). The soup dumplings are made perfectly as is everything else. \n\nWord to the wise. For the soup dumplings make sure they cool off or you'll burn your mouth. It is best to put in the soup ladle, bite the top and let it cool for a second. I did this and was not scorched by the hot hot and tasty soup inside. \n\nThis is not a fancy restaurant with a lot of atmosphere. It is what I put in the go if you're looking for delicious food.", "author": "Jesse B."}

We used to come here regularly so we are very familiar with their dishes.  Service used to be better too.  \n\nWhen we went today, we noticed the menu and interior were slightly different  Their once famous dishes recommended on the wall were gone.  We ordered xiao long bao, pork dumpling with green chives, spicy beef tendon, sesame bean cures, Shanghai pan fried soup dumpling and sesame pancake with marinated beef.   The pork dumpling skin was thicker and very little meat;  some bean cures were soft and some were chewy; the size of shanghai pan fried dumpling was smaller, almost like the size of xiao long bao.  The spicy beef tendon was too salty to eat.\n\nThe waitress was rude, when we asked for the tea be refilled or more napkin or an extra pair of chopsticks, she didn't respond.  She just kept walking, we didn't know if she heard us.  For the napkin, she did not put it on the table; she was more like a casino dealer serving you a card (napkin) on the table. \n\nWhen we arrived, we were surprised that there was no line unlike before.

Recently, I did a delivery from this place because I missed it (my friends and i used to come here every single week!). So this week I decided to stop by with my friends in person to get their food again.  However, the treatment from this place went downhill from my past visits.  \n\nLet me explain to you the issues we had here.  \n\nFirst, when we ordered our food, we asked specifically if we can order more later on in case it wasn't enough and the waiter said it was ok.  However, that wasn't the case!  When we wanted to order more again, the waiter said \"No!\" and didn't even give us an explanation and just walked away!   \n\nSecond- Aside from the attitude the waiter gave us, the food that day was horrible! The pan fried dumplings were horrible!  The ratio of the meat to the dough was like 3 to 1.  Since when did they become so stingy! I know things are expensive in California, but if you are going to be stingy with your items, you're going to lose some of your devoted customers!\n\nThird- This irks me the most.  We noticed that the waiter was super nice to the non-asian customers here. And the treated their Asian customers here with more attitude and no respect!  In the words of Eleanor from Crazy Rich Asians \"kaki lang\"  Why must your treat your Asian customers  with so much disrespect.  Show your \"kaki lang\" some respect! \n\nI used to come here every week back in the days, but now I can't even say when i'll be back ever again.  I will never return to this kingdom again!", "author": "Belinda C."}

But since there are none in the city, Kingdom of Dumpling will have to satisfy my dumpling cravings for now. The garlic soy sauce from the green beans were so delicious.

Because there's so much people, they take your orders while you're standing on the street. I understand that it is harder to take orders while people are seated as the waiter might block the small walkways, etc. So I let that go... I'm more interested in the food anyways. The first thing I noticed: this is literally your typical Chinese restaurant- place looks dirty, service isn't the best but the food looks good. \n\nWe ordered the green onion pancake, pork dumplings with napa, pork dumplings with chives, garlic pea shoots, shanghai soup dumpling, beef stew soup noodle and a beef chowfun.

Let me begin by saying that I love this dingy and cramped Mom and Pop vibe of this restaurant.  With giants like Din Tai Fung and other corporate eateries, it's nice to know that you have places like this still dishing out quality food.  \n\nI let my friend take a lead, and he orders the Chicken chow mein, the XLB's, pork and cabbage dumplings and string beans.  I usually judge a Chinese place by its chili oil and to my dismay they didn't have it (or at least on the table).  But my friend reassured me that their spicy sauce, albeit it drastically different than the familiar chili oil, was tasty.  And so I exuberantly pour it on my food and he's just staring at me, aghast.  He says that the sauce is super spicy.  I laugh.  I can handle spicy.  As I put it in my mouth, the spice coat my entire mouth, and boy, does it have a nice kick to it.  \n\nI like the homey feels of this place.

Everything was really good and I really enjoyed the vingear/soy sauce dipping sauce - just the perfect amount of flavor and tangy-ness.

I was circling and circling on those lookalike residential blocks hoping a space would open up, but no, I was constantly fooled by those little three-quarter spaces between the driveways. Alas, I finally found a place to park four blocks away from the restaurant, and Jamie W. and I were fighting the biting evening cold walking to this cramped spot. You can imagine our disappointment in having to sign a waiting list and sitting on a bench outside for our table to be ready.\n\nIndeed it was ten minutes later, but you had to squeeze between chairs, strollers and waitresses to get to it. We didn't waste time ordering as we started with the $7.95 Garlic String Beans which were wok-fried and thoroughly blistered the way I like 'em (photo: http://bit.ly/2nYMAFs). They were tasty if a tad oily. Jamie must have been in a takeout mood because he ordered the $7.95 XO Chicken Chow Mein which turned out to be a hefty portion of thick noodles mixed with the standard vegetables and again heavy on the greasy side (photo: http://bit.ly/2ogwHN2).\n\nI went with one of the specials way above my head on the whiteboard, the $13.95 Rack of Lamb with Rice. It wasn't a rack like Jayne Mansfield has a rack. It was three grilled lamb chops. The plate came with a bowl of rice, a dipping soy sauce, and three lonely asparagus spears - their idea of a gourmet dinner (photo: http://bit.ly/2oo5qsB). I was hoping for a little more lamb and a lot less salt but that's probably the best they can do for the price. Now you can't come to the Kingdom of Dumpling without ordering dumplings.\n\nIn order to fulfill our mission, we first ordered the $4.95 Shanghai Soup Dumplings because that's our litmus test for true dim sum and as expected, got a half-dozen in a basket (photo: http://bit.ly/2oQ5NwQ). They were just OK with a couple bereft of any broth inside. That was a bummer, and they certainly don't provide any worthy competition for Din Tai Fung. We ended our meal with the $5.95 Pork Pot Stickers (photo: http://bit.ly/2oWMO0t), which were steaming hot, hearty, and finally satisfying after all. Now for the Himalayan trek back to the car.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...everything was just a bit off in flavor with excessive oil the major culprit\nAMBIANCE - 2 stars...like eating in a walk-in closet with a lot of other people\nSERVICE - 3 stars...servers seem to know how to maneuver around those tightly arranged tables and they are fast\nTOTAL - 3 stars...if this be the Kingdom of Dumpling, when was the coronation?", "author": "Ed U."}

Being from north China myself, I know how sometimes the way we speak and act is normal in China but can be interpreted as rude in the US. But the staff here is... trying too hard? I noticed they brought out a chair outdoors so someone with a kid could have a seat, and that they gave some quarters to the meter maid so their customer indoors didn't have to worry about it.

Last week, we were at a holiday party where they had pans of 6 different kinds of dumplings (I liked the vegetarian and the chicken with corn), the beef pancake, noodles, green beans and others.

Maybe she should try posting something positive to help local businesses thrive instead of putting people down and making them look bad. I understand that Yelp is a forum for people to express how they feel but being someone who works in the industry it is often times just used as a forum for people to write negative and nasty things. \n\nHey lady, how about writing a positive review about something so we know that you're capable of actually liking something. You see that's what pisses me off... people who have so much time to express their hate and disdain for something yet they have no time to write one single review for an exceptional or even just a good experience they had somewhere else. In my opinion, if all of your experiences are unpleasant maybe it's because you're unpleasant.

In addition, their orange colored hot sauce is a beautiful mystery of its own.  I put that sauce on my dumplings, on my xo noodles, in the soup... it was outrageously addicting. \n\nI regret not ordering their non XLB dumplings or their Green Chives pancake. As I sat there eating my food, I noticed that these were also probably some of their staple items that I didn't get a chance to order.   By the time I looked up from my plate to notice the tables around me, I was already getting full. \n\nI am so glad that SanTung was closed on Christmas because it led us here. I will definitely be coming back for more.", "author": "Miyeon L."}

The shop is small, so be ready to squish your party! That also means be ready to wait. When I found this place a couple years ago, the wait went up to nearly an hour, but it hasn't been that bad as of late. The service REALLY depends on who's working. There used to be (?) an older man whose priority is to get people in and out. So don't expect great service when their priority is to get sales.\n\nWith that in mind... these are damn good dumplings. Honestly one of the best dumplings for the prince point and casual environment. I've tried other items too, chow mein, green beans, eggplant, beef and onion pancakes -\u00a0all so good! And that sauce!!! It looks like La Vics, but perfectly suited for literally anything on the menu. Creamy, spicy, and tangy. We've tried to buy their sauce before, but they don't sell it!\n\nIf you're gonna complain about parking, welcome to SF. This is the Sunset, so it's not even as bad as the rest of the city. Drop off one party member to get your name on the list, and expect the worst for parking. It'll make the experience better.", "author": "Jacquelyn T."}

Came here on a Friday evening - to no crowd - luckily. Tbh, it was 30mins to the start of the Finals Game 4 though. So I don't think that's the usual wait time. \n\nHonestly, came here one other time and wasn't impressed w the food quality. But I was in the area yesterday and thought I'd give KoD another try. Went family style and ordered two apps and two types of dumplings. Got the tofu skin and cold wide bean noodle + fish dumplings and some sort of pork dumpling situation (I don't eat meat sooo idk). \n\nIf you're not aware of this, they have a sister restaurant in SSF called Dumpling Empire. And it's awesomeeee. One of my fav restaurants. Food quality over there (with the exact same menu) is by far superior to Kingdom of Dumpling. \n\nThe tofu skin app was totally mushy and over boiled. Uhhhh wth? You only have so many dishes on your menu, it shouldn't be that hard. Then the wide bean noodles seemed a bit undercooked (too chewy). Guys, swap your cooking times or something! \n\nLuckily the fish dumplings were standard. Standard as in YUM. But they're made across the street at their Kingdom of Dumpling Wholesale (literally across and one block down), sooo they really just need to boil them. Thank goodness these came out perfectly. \n\nSlather the strange looking orange sauce at the table on EVERYTHING. It's their homemade hot sauce.

It was probably mostly cabbage. \n\nThe shrimp in the shrimp dumplings was really good, but there was only 1-2 little pieces per dumpling!!! I'd say 90% of the filling volume was chive, meaning that if you ate the dumpling in two bits, you really only got 1 with shrimp in it. \n\nThe soup dumplings looked the best and after a little zap in the microwave there was actual soup in them.

It took us 2 tries until we settled with kingdom-- it was open late and wasn't super busy. \n\nFirst things first, this place is NOT for big groups. This place is definitely a small hole in the wall type restaurant. The max capacity was prolly about 20-25? Cramped space with only about 6-8 small tables...so it took a while for us to be seated (approx. 20-25 min wait?). We had to split up into 2 groups which was okay, not a problem. They have a \"sign-in\" board and a menu outside for people to decide on what they wanted before being seated, which was helpful.\n\nMy friends and I ordered the 2 plates of chow fun, pork/shrimp wonton soup, pork dumplings, shanghai soup dumplings and their garlic bok choy. And that was for 4 girls to share :P My fave was of course the chow fun and the shanghai soup dumplings. All the others were good, too. No complaints. We were satisfied with our orders. \n\nService on the other hand was ehh alright. The waitress would ask if we were ready then leave and the guy which I presume was the owner or manager would then take our order then would get distracted. But he did check up on us after we received our dishes. \n\nOverall, dishes were reasonable priced and the food was good. Service was meh.

I personally liked their steamed soup dumplings which were steamed just right not to make the soup inside too scalding hot to eat. Tried the pork and shrimp dumplings with chives and the chicken with chives. The pork and shrimp were ok but unremarkable, the chicken dumplings in my opinion were the better. The chicken tasted juicy and worked well with the chives. Also ordered the fried soup dumplings which weren't my favorite, it was a bit too doughy for my tastes. Ended up also ordering some wings and string beans. The wings were meh, I wouldn't recommend them. The string beans were a surprise as they were very flavorful and the string beans themselves were fresh and crunchy. The place is tiny so expect a wait on busy times. The food here I'd say is reasonably priced. FYI they only do 1 credit card per table so have cash or venmo ready if you're going with friends.

Also, you apparently have a twin called King of Noodles in Inner Sunset, which I did not know served xiao long bao! I guess I took your names at face value.\n\nThis place is quite petite, but the waiter has the best sense of humor. We ordered dumplings and noodles, after which he commented that we didn't have any vegetables. I replied, \"Carbs only!\" and he laughed and said, \"But you're so skinny!\" A+++ for you, my friend.\n\nThe first dish that came out was the BEEF STEW SOUP NOODLE, $7.45, which you can customize to be spicy (they just throw in some of their homemade orange spicy sauce). My friend wanted it spicy, which, fortunately, is not that spicy for those weak-of-chile. The noodles, like King of Noodles, are homemade, doughy, and not that chewy. The broth is surprisingly light and unsalty in a good way. The meat is thinly-cut beef shank, and some quarters of bok choy and black fungus mushrooms are thrown in for good measure. However, I personally prefer beef chuck cubes over beef shank, so I wasn't in love with the dish.\n\nThe next dish was the CHICKEN DUMPLINGS WITH GREEN CHIVES, 12 pieces for $6.95. Hearty filling, delicious dumplings. I like it.\n\nThird dish was the SHANGHAI SOUP DUMPLINGS (xiao long bao), 6 pieces for $4.95. The dumplings are shaped as thin peaks rather than wide blobs, which is a change of pace. The thickness of the wrapper is on par with that of Dumpling Kitchen, the soup is plentiful, but the amount of pork filling is somewhat lacking.\n\nSame issue with quantity of meat applies to their SHANGHAI PAN FRIED SOUP DUMPLINGS (sheng jian bao), which, despite the English description, contain no soup. $4.95 for 4 pieces, which is kind of pricey... BUT. Even though their meat insides are quite minuscule, they do the best job with a light, fluffy breading, shaped into a cute bun, fried golden brown on the bottom and topped with sesame seeds and chopped green onions on top. This has been the least dense and least oily of the sheng jian baos I've tried in the city, which makes it my favafav.\n\nDumpling Kitchen for xiao long bao, Kingdom of Dumpling for sheng jian bao and an ego booster.", "author": "Adele F."}

The dumplings are house-made and flavorful and have a good skin thickness to meat ratio (pretty balanced). Sauce isn't 100% soysauce and/or vinegar thank god. Dumplings are 100. And although they have a wide variety of foods on the menu, I'd say most of them are pretty standard and not extraordinary.\n\nTheir beef pancake is a little disappointing in that it's very greasy and the pancake isn't the usual chewy scallion pancakes I'm used to, rather it's some type of fried, dense, dough? Maybe a regional nuance but the beef is also ground but I was expecting tender beef slices (ok I'm probably thinking of Taiwanese beef rolls which aren't pancakes but that's what I wanted). \n\nI also had their beef noodle bowl which was alright. Towards the end the noodles started tasting like salt and I couldn't finish it--especially since there was too many noodles for the toppings that came with it. \n\nWill return for more dumplings!", "author": "Lydia Z."}

We signed in outside and we were all given menus so when you step inside be ready to order!\n\nLee was our server, he is pure Joy and makes everyone smile as he jumps from table to table! Let me explain, part of this experience was the interaction with Lee, he took our order at a rapid fire pace. There was a large group that left ahead of us and 4 tables were seated at once. I swear he took all four table orders in about 1.30 seconds, when you sit down know what you want to order! When he took our order we heard green beans and they were delivered to the table and they were so good, they were in a soy sauce base with so much cooked garlic I was stealing every piece I could get my chopsticks on. \n\nWe were a little boring, we had the pork and chive dumplings and they were wonderful. We had Beijing bean paste noodles, on the menu it said it was a soup, there was no broth but it was ever so good. The couple next to us who are regulars told us to order the dumplings in a soup because the broth is so good. \n\nThis is not the place for the long conversation, be kind, and mindful that there are 15 people standing outside.

Yes! But beware. Kingdom of Dumpling is the perfect definition of \"hole-in-the-wall.\" This place is TINY. We had to put a chair on the side, making a two seat table to accommodate three people. \n\nMy first thought was, \"Wow this place is tiny.\" Then it became, \"Wow, how am I supposed to pig out with such a tiny table!??!!\" It's a real problem! What if I want to order the whole menu?! \n\nUnfortunately, we didn't have the stomach to order the whole menu. Instead, we went with two orders of their Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings), one order of pork and chive dumplings, one XO beef chow fun, and one onion pancake. The food was ready very fast! \n\nTheir Xiao long bao were done really nicely. They weren't sweet and the soup was yummy. However, there wasn't enough soup in some of them. Some of them just looked like plain dumplings -- all dried up on the inside! I also wished that they had more flavor as well. NEEDS MOAR MSG!!!!!!!\n\nThe pork and chive dumplings were juicy and really delicious! The skin of the dumplings was a little on the thick side but I love that! It gives it a little chew. And you know what else is great with these dumplings? THEIR HOT SAUCE. Their hot sauce is filled with minced garlic and peppers. It was spicy and delicious! It went wonderful with the dumplings! I think by the end of the night, I had about 4-5 spoonfuls of the deliciousauce! \n\nThe XO beef chow fun was pretty much beef chow fun. Why is it called XO? I don't think there was a gram of XO sauce in that thing haha! It was pretty decent regardless. It had enough of that wok aroma! Gotta eat it when it's still hot/warm though! \n\nThe onion pancake? It was really oily but it was still very good. It did lack the stretchiness that I typically love. It was also a little bit more thick than what you would imagine it to be but that's fine. It tastes good and my boyfriend gobbled pretty much the whole thing up! \n\nIf you need the restroom, you'll have to venture past their tiny kitchen to get to it (but hey at least they got one right?!). Surprisingly, the bathroom is not as tiny as you would think it is. It's actually quite roomy.\n\n:) I would definitely come back for their dumplings and hot sauce.

Instead of a lunch size portion of hot  & sour soup, a small bowl, they brought a GIANT bowl. I explained that's not what I ordered but they wouldn't take it back.

Just be mindful of how much you order. Seriously. Everything is so cheap that I need to constantly keep myself from ordering half the menu. To get a little taste of all they have to offer, I'd recommend 1 order of a dozen dumplings (I love the lamb and chives dumplings), 1 order of flat noodle soup with dumplings (comes with 6 more of your choosing), and of course, the garlic string beans. That's enough to share between 2 people. Their dumplings are very juicy and seasoned well, that's what separates them from the rest. \n\nATMOSPHERE: Small place. It's not unusual to see a line of people outside this place on the weekends. Restaurant traffic flows pretty quickly so it's not a bad wait most of the time. This place is dirty/sticky too.

Tables are covered with checkered table cloths under glass top.  The signs taped to the dirty window overlooking the street are crumply and stained.  The signs taped to the walls are outdated, bragging of dishes that have been offered for years, purporting them as \"new\" (per my boyfriend, who has been there many times in the past).  \n\nOrdering experience:  It was slightly difficult to order because of the language barrier with our server.  He also pressured us into expanding our order with another dish, and by our own fault, we chose a dish that ended up being our least favorite by a large margin.  We were not even that hungry to begin with and we shouldn't have succumbed.\n\nFood:\n\nJellyfish with cucumbers and carrots - BLAND 1/5\n\nTofu skin with cilantro - SALTY and terrible, also, the pieces of tofu that were stuck together were a little undercooked. 0/5\n\nIn my opinion, both non dumpling dishes should be better flavored.  Either work on the non-dumpling items, or remove from the menu.\n\nPork and chive dumplings and soup dumplings were fine. The dumpling skin is thick and white in color, not the most appetizing looking.  My boyfriend said it tasted better before, and it has gone slightly downhill at least in presentation.  For example, they used to plate the soup dumplings on top of Napa cabbage. Now it is presented on top of wax paper. 4/5\n\nWhen asked how everything was, I told the waiter the tofu skin wasn't my favorite and he said nothing.  Wait staff was nice enough but did not do anything to ensure we had a good experience.\n\nI wouldn't mind the ambiance and look of the restaurant if it could back it up with spectacular food.  This was just kind of a hole in the wall with average quality dumplings and below average other offerings.  Disappointing.", "author": "Christina G."}

Over the last half decade, it has exploded with popularity and now, the place is always packed with a regular group of people waiting outside. \n\nTheir dumplings are soothing and delicious! I always order the pork and napa cabbage dumplings, which has a nice soft skin and subtle juicy flavors in the dumplings. Although the flavors by itself are not heavy, it pairs perfectly with the soy sauce/vinegar provided. I also love their garlic string beans and garlic cucumbers, very fresh, flavorful, and crunchy. The beef pancake is a pretty good size and tastes good also. It is a little oily, but that is to be expected with these types of pancakes. Recently, I tried their beef stew noodle soup, which has a nice and soothing soup broth with plenty chunks of beef stew, soft and delicious noodles, fresh bok choy, and mushrooms. This would be perfect for a cold day.\n\nA couple items we ordered that I think I can skip next time - the salt pepper tofu and the green onion pancake. The salt pepper tofu lacked a good salt pepper flavor and instead, kind of had a little odd flavor to it. It was a little bland. The green onion pancake was not bad, but it should be ordered with traditional small dishes that compliment the green onion pancake. By itself, it was a little plain and a little dry.  \n\nIt was HOT inside the little restaurant. We sat at the table next to the kitchen, which made it even hotter. The owner and staff were very attentive and talkative. Although I do like eating here, I usually don't like to wait long for a table. I definitely would recommend this restaurant, but incase you don't like to wait, you can come before or after peak lunch/dinner times...OR you can buy frozen dumplings from their to-go shop on Taraval and bring them home to cook.", "author": "Jean S."}

I came in w/ my BF at 1pm on a Sunday for lunch and most tables were taken. After looking thru yelp, we ordered the XLB (6), green string beans w/ garlic, pork & Napa cabbage dumplings (12), green chives pancake (2 cut into 4 pieces) & spicy beef noodle soup. All were pretty good for the price you pay. I would def recommend the green chives pancake; it was very crispy and full of flavor!! The XLB was ok. The dumplings seemed like they were boiled for a bit too long as the skin was soggy and was about to rip. I would not recommend the spicy beef noodle soup because the soup base tasted like water with a HINT of beef flavor & they used chili oil to make it spicy. The best part about the noodle soup was the beef itself-- very tender and flavorful. It's too bad the soup and noodles couldn't complement it. \n\nService was great. The manager and serving staff were very kind and kept checking on us.", "author": "Emily L."}

A must get. \n-Soup dumpling - smaller than before and less juice but still packs a punch especially combined with their spicy sauce and ginger infused soy sauce. \n\nHit or Miss: \n-The shrimp/chive dumpling doesn't really have a lot of shrimp anymore, but it still is super filling and made perfectly. \n-The chow mein is on the super salty side the past times I have come - still hits the spot, but warning on salt level. \n-Chive pancake - a little expensive for a pancake and not as fat and large as before. Still tasty for a starter. \n\nIn terms of wait, the wait is semi long (30 min to an hour at times) especially after 5:30, but it is worth it if you really are craving some dim sum!!

Tucked in in a little shop, you find amazing, petite sized little mouthfuls of yumminess in each dumpling! This restaurant is extremely small (imagine the size of a kitchen and a small dining room that holds less than 15 people). Extremely cozy and staff are kind. Sitting in close quarters, you can see the chef cook in the background as well- something that is so comforting especially in a small business restaurant.\n\nI would have just bypassed this place if I was walking by but thank goodness my little sister found it! Each plate of dumplings has 10 pieces and the soup dumplings have 6. My little sister and I got a plate of shrimp and chives dumpling, a plate of chicken and Napa cabbage dumplings, an order of soup dumplings and an order of fried green beans.\n\nThe green beans were cooked perfectly with a nice sear to it and perfectly crisp. As she was cooking it, I noticed a flash of flames in the background behind me and I realized those were our green beans cooking, the chef does have some amazing cooking skills!!\n\nOur shrimp and chives were so flavorful- lots of chives and a penny sized piece of shrimp in each dumpling but oh so flavorful! The chicken and Napa cabbage dumpling tastes like a dumpling from trader joes but a lot fresher and you can tell the skins of the dumpling are made fresh to order.\n\nWhat are soup dumplings you ask?! It is a steamed dumpling with a small amount of broth in every bite!!!!! At first, I cut it open on my plate and noticed a bit of soup coming out on my plate, then I realized I can put the dumpling on my spoon, bite off a piece of it and sip the soup on my spoon. \n\nAll in all, for sure I will be coming back to this restaurant!!!

But nothing can stop me in the never-ending quest for the perfect XLB.\n\nWe started with the CILANTRO BEAN CURD, which was refreshing and makes you feel healthy (if I ever go through a vegetarian phase, Taiwanese bean curd noodle will definitely be a staple).  The chewy tofu texture is the QQ-est of all noodles, and whatever mystery sauce they use complements the soy flavors very well: an appetizing appetizer.\n\nThe PORK AND NAPA CABBAGE DUMPLING tasted deliciously homemade and I especially liked how light it was.  Dumplings at some places use pork so fatty it's almost sickening, but you can devour the Dumplings of the Kingdom and still have space in your stomach for more of their other amazing food\n\nMy honest opinion of the XLB is that it is a good honest attempt with nicely balanced soup and pork flavors.  However the skin is horrendously thick and chewy--for any XLB snobs that make comparisons to the DTF/Crystal Jade (which are such juggernauts it seems like they engineer their XLB to perfection).  It also has a bit of a funny look that reminds me of stiff peaks (yes I've been baking lately) so your food porn may be a little silly.\n \nI was excited to try the green chive pancake which looked like pockets of chivey goodness, but they said they sold out se we replaced it with the BEEF PANCAKE.  The beef could arguably be bland, but on the plus side that means it wasn't too salty.  The pancake was toasty, and like the rest of the food here, I really liked the light, (relatively) healthy, homemade cooking style.  It's like I just became best friends with someone who can cook delish TW/Shanghai food from family recipes.\n\nTotal after tax was ~$25.. whaaa!  (Or in Chinese lingo, I guess it should be waaah!)  In the Parkside Three Kingdoms for dumplings (the other two being Dumpling Kitchen and House of Pancakes), I think Kingdom of Dumping wins.\n\nTip: They have another location on Taraval that sells frozen dumplings!  They should call it the Kingdom of Dumpling kitchen just to troll with Dumpling Kitchen", "author": "Edna C."}

They have a lot of filling options, and they're all rather cheap. Other items we ordered:\n\nChicken wings: not much flavor at all, small portion size for the price, and overcooked/dry\n\nXiaolongbao: good texture and amount of broth, but also a bit lacking in flavor\n\nShengjianbao: I liked these overall - only comment would be maybe the filling:dough ratio could be improved a bit\n\nGarlic string beans: good, but disappointingly small portion for the price\n\nThis was my first visit, but I think I would only come here again if I wanted to get jiaozi. For all the other menu items, the prices were a bit too high for the portions, and Dumpling Kitchen does a better job with the Shanghai specialties.", "author": "Delia Z."}

I really wanted to try the dumplings and whatever else people recommended. \n\nI ordered: The pork and cabbage dumplings, chicken fried rice and the onion pancake. What I liked about all of the dishes was that they weren't super greasy like some Chinese places. The dough on the dumplings was so soft and fresh and the filling was great, which\nwas nice because I wasn't sure the pork and cabbage would go well, so I took a risk and it paid off! It was so good that I'm not sure I'll be able to try any of the other dumplings :-p \n\nThe fried rice had a lot going on, in fact, I believe there was even corn in it, but it all tasted great and the chicken was cooked perfectly. As for the onion pancake, it was light and yummy! Again, I was sooooo glad none of these items were really greasy because I didn't feel much guilt after eating.\n\nI will definitely come back and may be able to convince my husband that Chinese food is good with these dishes!", "author": "Steph L."}

We waited for about 25 minutes, but the owner or host takes orders while you're outside waiting so when you finally get seated your food is ready!

The menu has a large assortment of dumplings. I have brought a number of people to eat here from family, friends, my fianc\u00e9, and there were times where I came just to eat myself! It is that good.\n\nMy favorite is the Shanghai soup dumplings as it comes out piping hot with a good amount of \"soup\" that warms your belly (unlike other places that have minimal or no \"soup\") and enough meat to leave you tearing for the next one. I typically also order the pork and corn dumplings with the stir fry green beans. Those two are bomb dot com! I have had other dumplings like the pork and chives, pork and cabbage, but there was nothing special with the flavor. \n\nDO NOT get the chicken fried rice. I made the mistake of getting it this last time and it was so salty I couldn't eat more then a couple of bites before I felt my blood pressure go through the roof. \n\nOverall, great place to go, just avoid peak hours because it gets crazy crowded and cramped.

I've been visited Kingdom of Dumplings couple times but haven't really thought about writing a review for them.\n\nKingdom of Dumpling is the typical small and homey Chinese restaurant. The seats are limited and customers sit very close to each other when dine in, however, that doesn't affect any bit of the comfort food they've got here. Friendly with smiles on their faces, the staff sure know how to warm the customers' hearts up. \n\nFor the most recent visit, we had Grilled Lamb Skewer, Shanghai Soup Dumpling (aka Xiao Long Bao), Stir-fried String Beans and Beef Roll. \n\nGrilled Lamb Skewer: be aware if you are not the citizens of spicy-land, they sprinkled canyon pepper on the top and that made us in fire, had to order soda to cool the tongues off. Surprisingly it was less spicier the next day after re-heated in the microwave. Nice texture, meat itself was tender and very flavorful.\n\nShanghai Soup Dumpling: I guess I don't have to put anymore words on this but the portion was on point, I usually dip light in the sauce and then eat the whole dumpling, let the soup explode in my mouth and experience everything in that little thing.\n\nStir-fried String Beans: your go-to veggies. If you like medium cook and still have that little crunchy-ness when you chew it, this is for you. A little bit heavy on the dressing and I just dipped on the edge and it was all good.\n\nBeef Roll: different than I expected, I was thinking about the pancake and beef roll together (with cilantro which I usually hate), this one had the stuffing (beef and green onions) in the pancake, and slice in equal 4 piece -- think about pita bread (pocket) with meat patty in there -- here you go. Tasty, juicy, filled up my tummy. \n\nThe owner (seems like he is the owner) was busy checking on every table to make sure everything is alright. Before we left, he came up to the door with a big smile and said goodbye. I smiled back and said \"thank you\". Reasonable price, good portion, nice staff, I will be back again for sure. \n\nps.

Like I went to Saison and rated them five stars, but me giving Kingdom of Dumpling four stars doesn't mean they are 80% as good.\n\nAnyway, within the category of cheap Chinese food, I think this place is amazing. I've been here a ton of times and it's always solid. The variety of dumplings is great, with clearly different flavors. Pork and corn is a particularly good one, as the sweet corn taste goes well with the salty pork. The xiao long bao are perfect to me, granted I've never been to Shanghai but they are as good as any I've had anywhere in Northern California or NYC. I would also highly recommend the beef pancake, which is amazing! The crispy skin and spiced beef mixture is so intensely savory. If you want to kick it up one more notch, slather some of the orange spicy sauce they have inside. It's got vinegar and hot peppers in it, and adds to the whole thing. Just remember that when these come out of the oven, they are lava hot, so give it a few minutes to cool!\n\nI'm giving this place 4 stars rather than 5 for two reasons. First, the bathroom situation is ridiculous. You have to walk through the cramped, steamy kitchen to get there, and while it's clean enough, it's just too small. My second complaint dovetails with that, in that the restaurant itself is way too small. I get SF rent is crazy, but come on, there's like 8 tables and the line can get ridiculous. The place makes enough money to warrant some sort of expansion.\n\nThey take credit cards, which is awesome, but in typical Chinese fashion will only split 2. Also, if you find yourself behind a big line of people, put your name on the list and go have a drink across the street! This place is pretty close to the ocean, and it gets cold and windy at night, so instead of waiting on the sidewalk like a chump, go into a bar and grab a cocktail like a pro.\n\nLast thing, I wish Yelp would disallow pictures of food that have been bitten. I wish I could speak to everyone who posts pictures of half-eaten xiao long baos and tell them \"hey idiot, nobody wants to see your mid-meal food!\" And I get that sometimes you eat some food, then remember you wanted to take a picture, but come on, do you think people want to see photos of dirty plates with solitary dumplings on them? Let me answer that, since some people are confused: NO, nobody wants to see a dirty plate of mostly-eaten food. If you forgot to take a photo, just wait until next time, ok?", "author": "Sm L."}

We also ordered the mustard greens and tofu soup and that had several tiny bugs in it.  We called the waiter over and he immediately took it back and said he would make a fresh batch.  The second batch also had several small little bugs.  My son was convinced they were bugs but I didn't have my reading glasses with me so I wasn't sure.  So we put a couple of these on a napkin and took them home and put them under a magnifying glass and then it was definitely clear they were bugs.  There were several of them in the bowl.

It's a cold dish, thinly sliced lotus root, very refreshing, awesome flavor. More like a salad\n-Soup dumplings (aka xiao long baos): these came steaming and piping hot. I was so excited to try these, but unfortunately it did not lineup to the hype. Although they were nicely size, very juicy, I just felt that the flavors were lacking. Very plain to me, did not satisfied the tastebuds at all. I definitely had better XLB in several SoCal joints such as din tai fung, mama lugs etc. \n-shrimp and chive dumplings: these were really good. Great flavor. Good portion of shrimp to pork ratio. I was one happy camper.\n-Beef pancake: for some reason, I thought these were the same thing as the beef rolls. But nope, they're just as they describe it..pancake with a beef (meat pie) in the middle. It was a bit greasy for my liking, but the flavors were good in the meat and not too salty.\n\nOverall I would recommend coming here for the dumplings, but if you're craving good Xiao long bao, I think there are better places.

Everything, from the hole-in-the-wall location that boasts of ten cramped tables at most, to the authentic handmade dumplings, to the \"\u5927\u5988\" in the back of the kitchen yelling orders is nostalgic. If you're not familiar with Northern Chinese cuisine, you should know that it's on a whole not known for its stir-fried dishes, but rather for its flour-based foods such as noodles, bready pancakes, and most of all, dumplings. I sampled a variety of three kinds of dumplings this time around, and I was incredibly impressed. \n\nOne thing that's important to note is their policy for no add-on orders. You must order everything at once.  If you're looking for to-go frozen dumplings, you have to go to their other location a couple blocks away, as this location only serves as a restaurant. They also provide each table with old-school dipping sauce: black vinegar with ginger slivers (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kingdom-of-dumpling-san-francisco-2?select=vojYioqorzEeMqQ0Cgu3HA#297YAMl2nK_XjTHRi3OnVA).\n\nSliced pig ear appetizer (cold, spicy if desired):\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kingdom-of-dumpling-san-francisco-2?select=vojYioqorzEeMqQ0Cgu3HA#CdY82DteUpyjwv3VOm6MMA)\nI thought this cold appetizer dish was well-made. Pig ears are cartilaginous in the middle and soft on the outside, so it creates a contrast of textures on its own. The sauce was just the right amount of saltiness, and we added on some spiciness to give it some more kick. I think this would have been good without the spiciness as well though.\n\nLamb dumplings:\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kingdom-of-dumpling-san-francisco-2?select=vojYioqorzEeMqQ0Cgu3HA#SEYoCOs31U5C0q-9FFSuaQ)\nThese are probably the heaviest dumplings out of the three that I tried, but the flavor was quite good. Lamb has that gamey taste, but even without too many other ingredients, the flavor of that wasn't overwhelming here. Dipped into the black vinegar to cut the grease, these were really good. I might still prefer the chive and napa cabbage and pork ones more though.\n\nPork and chive dumplings:\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kingdom-of-dumpling-san-francisco-2?select=vojYioqorzEeMqQ0Cgu3HA#zkNKOXn4c9L6cCZjJ887Vg)\nSuper authentic, and really delicious. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful, but the filling wasn't overly salty either. The dumplings were boiled perfectly (three times!) so that they were cooked all the way through but the wrappers were still elastic. The chives were plentiful and cut (not chopped) to a good size. Probably my favorite rendition of pork and chive dumplings in the states.\n\nPork and napa cabbage dumplings:\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kingdom-of-dumpling-san-francisco-2?select=vojYioqorzEeMqQ0Cgu3HA#PuB9utjf1xXVFVNpym9yUQ)\nNapa cabbage has a more subtle flavor, probably the most subtle of the vegetables used in dumplings, and it's easy to try and overcompensate for it. But not here! The ratio of pork to napa cabbage was spot-on, and the flavor was really good.

Placed an order on Eat24 and got a confirmation my order would be ready in around 30 mins. I showed up around 30 mins later. \n\nWhen I walked in, no one would acknowledge me. When I finally talked to one of the ladies clearing a table, she checked in with someone from the kitchen. She told me to wait outside so I walked outside. After some back and forth between the employees, a man walked over to me and told me they didn't get my order. I mentioned that eat24 confirmed it, but he said since they have 2 locations, the boss who confirmed the order was at the other location so he hadn't sent the order to this restaurant yet. So I gave him my order again and waited outside. \n\nAt this point, the roommate had been circling around cuz parking in this area sucks. So now I had to tell him it'd be another 20 mins. He found a place to pull over but this was super annoying to say the least! The guy who took my order kept saying 5 more mins even though I knew it would take longer. We finally got our order and went home. We ordered the following:\n\nCrispy chicken wings ($5.95)\nShrimp dumpling with green chives ($6.95)\nShanghai soup dumpling ($4.95)\nShanghai pan fried soup dumpling ($4.95)\nPork pot sticker ($5.95)\nBeef pancake ($5.95)\nXO beef chow fun ($6.95)\nGarlic string beans ($6.95)\n\nI actually enjoyed a lot of the non dumpling dishes. The string beans were crunchy and flavorful. The XO beef chow fun had a good amount of beef and bean sprouts. The beef pancake was filled with delicious layers of beef. The dumplings were actually a disappointment. Not sure if it was cuz we got take out, but the Soup dumplings lost all their soup. The Shrimp dumpling with green chives was mostly chives and not so much shrimp.\n\nI might come back to sit down and eat since I really wanna try the deliciousness of the XLB that everyone seems to have experienced. But I'll probably never get take out from them again. If you decide to order online, make sure to call them to confirm!", "author": "Elena N."}

We came around 8:30pm on a Saturday, and our table of four was seated immediately. I think we were pretty lucky, because a few other groups came after us, and they had to wait for table. \n\nAs for the shanghai dumplings, each had a huge mouthful of soup in each one. The soup to meat ratio felt like 2:1. There actually wasn't all that much meat in each dumpling; it was mostly soup! The dumpling skin wasn't especially thin, but I guess that made easier to pick up. The dumplings were served PIPING HOT, so I'd recommend letting them cool for a good few minutes before popping the whole thing in your mouth. \n\nOther good dishes were:\n:: Farmer's cucumber - classic pickled cucumber served in China. Bonus, they use ORGANIC cucumber. \n:: Cold wide bean noodle - another good starter dish with cucumber and bean noodle. It has a similar flavor to the farmer's cucumber though, so I'd probably order one or the other.\n:: Pork and corn dumplings - the corn gives a nice hint of sweetness to the dumplings. Very authentic. \n:: Pot stickers - the skin has a nice chewy texture, and the bottom is slightly crispy. They had originally botched up this order, and they made a whole new order for us. The boss paid high attention to quality! Wish they had told us this rather than wait for us to ask about it before explaining.\n\nDishes I'd pass on: \n:: Pan-Fried Buns (Sheng Jian Bao) - the bottom wasn't crispy enough, and the bread was soggy from the soup. I've definitely had better.\n:: Canned soda - not served cold, and no ice.\n\nThe boss made the whole experience that much better, because he was extremely attentive to every table -- I don't know how he did it! He heard every comment that we made, even though he was rushing around serving dishes and taking orders. He was also very friendly and constantly came back to check that we were doing well. Great service, but he could've communicated better about the pot stickers instead of waiting for us to ask about it. Awesome that they take credit card!", "author": "Audrey L."}

I've had Kingdom of Dumplings bookmarked for a while and decided to try it one night so I picked up three of my friends from Embarcadero and Fillmore to come here. This area is not very public transportation friendly apparently! \n\nWe came on a Sunday night and street parking was fairly easy to find. There were around 4 groups of 2 to 4 people ahead of us. The restaurant is pretty tiny and doesn't seat very many people so it was always packed. The wait was surprisingly short though and not too bad. Service was super friendly as well. This restaurant was a little overhyped in my opinion but I still enjoyed it and it satisfied my craving for a home cooked meal. \n\nString beans 4/5 - I loved dipping my dumplings in the soy sauce that came with these string beans. \nXLB and dumplings 4/5 - We ordered two dumplings and one XLB. They all came out hot and fresh but I still like my mom's XLB and dumplings better. \nBeef pancake 4/5 - This was good! I've never had pancake with meat inside. \nChicken wings 3/5 - For some reason, I was expecting the fried salt and pepper chicken wings so I was surprised when these came out. The wings were sweet but not too flavorful. \nChow Fun 2/5 - There wasn't enough sauce or flavor. This ranks maybe at the bottom of the list of chow fun I have tried. \n\nAfter dinner, we walked around for dessert and found Marco Polo ice cream down the street. I would definitely recommend going there for an after dinner treat!", "author": "Karen L."}

Then came the soup dumplings (aka xiao long baos), pork & corn dumplings, pork dumplings, and cucumber garlic appetizer! I recommend always ordering the cucumber garlic appetizer with any dumpling meals because it is super refreshing and tends to clean my palette well. I personally like the corn and pork dumplings and xlb best here - but make sure you order everything at once, because the waitress that usually works here gets fussy when you order later on during your meal - so come prepared.

You will not need to venue too far from Taraval Street, which blends in the Parkside Neighborhood and outer Sunset District. This neighborhood happens to be home to several of the best Chinese dumpling houses in the city without having to shell out a premium price. The options for stellar dumplings may be plentiful. Kingdom of Dumpling, however, may be my personal favorite. The dumplings here are superb! They are 100% handmade in-house daily and delicious.\n\nThese Beijing style dumplings are characteristic for their thicker, more doughy skins. The texture, however, was almost velvet-like soft. The pork and other main ingredients wrapped inside the skins came piping hot, juicy and so flavorful. \n\nXiaolongbao or Shanghai Soup Dumplings (12), $9.90 - their prized soup dumplings were prepared flawlessly! The skin was soft to the touch but kept enough firmness to hold its texture. The meat actually bounced in the broth inside. The soup was still simmering hot and the pork, customarily rolled up into a ball, was unbelievably tasty. They were right up there on my short list of the best xia long bao I have tasted.\n\nThe other dishes we ordered I would highly recommend as well.\n\nPork Dumplings with Green Chives (12), $5.95 - one of my favorite dumpling combinations because these green garlic chives really enhances the flavor of pork. You get a hint of garlic as you bite into each juicy morsel. \n\nPork and Shrimp Dumplings (12), $6.45 - I always order this combination and it is a good barometer of how special the dumplings are. Both the flavors of the pork and shrimp really came through and had just the right amount of firmness, not overly cooked. The juiciness of the shrimp indicated its freshness and that it was not frozen prior.\n\nPork Dumplings with Napa Cabbage (12), $5.95 - another undeniably delicious combination. There is just enough cabbage to marry the flavor of pork and balance the saltiness. It also added texture to the meat.\n\nShanghai style donuts (2) , $2.95 - a gooey flour dough, topped with sesame seeds, and filled with warm sweet red beans. It was incredibly delicious and a wonderful surprise.\n\nThe preparation and taste of the dumplings here are hard to match.

The XLB were juicy and delicious and did not disappoint. Bathed in vinegar and their house hot sauce, these small delicious bites are sure to please. The corn flavor in the pork and corn dumplings was well balanced also making them a sweet addition to our meal. If you arrive hungry, the cucumber salad comes out almost immediately to fend off your hunger, but it's nothing to write home about.

The restaurant is this tiny whole in the wall place run by a Chinese family.  \n\nPig ears: Fatty, meaty and very cartilagie, just the way I like it. The pieces of meat was well marinated, however, it lacked a little garlic and onions.\n\nSoup dumplings: MMMMMMMM! These were  better than expected. In order to eat these soup dumplings correctly; you are suppose to place one on your spoon, bite the tip and pour in the vinegar ginger sauce into the dumpling and eat everything at once. Every bite is exploded with the pork flavor goodness and a little sour taste from the sauce. Pretty freaking delicious! The size of the dumplings here is perfect; not too big or too small which makes eating this little things much more easier.\n\n \nFried soup dumplings: I thought there was suppose to have soup in these dumplings even after its been fried. It was the same price as the soup dumplings but not worth the stomach room or calories.\n\nPork and cabbage dumplings: Yummy. The dumpling skin had a nice chewy texture and the pork and cabbage filling was good.\n\nBeef chowfun: Typical beef chowfun but it had too much bean sprout.\n\nBeef tendon soup: Ew. This was the only dish I regret ordering. The noodles were overcooked and the broth was extremely bland.

The waiter tried to get us to order more food than we wanted by telling us it wasn't enough and that we only had 1 chance to order (it was only 6PM...).

Since San Jose is too far away and the waits are ridiculous, does Kingdom of Dumpling scratch that XLB itch? For the most part, I'd have to say yes. \n\nThe xlb are flavorful and well constructed. They come 6 to an order, and were ready to go as soon as we sat down (they take your order while you're waiting, which I think is a pretty cool way to compensate for the lack of space within the restaurant). The broth has a good amount of depth and the pork is very flavorful. They're certainly not as delicate as the DTF offerings, but are delicious nonetheless. The thickness and consistency of the shell reminded me of the xlb at Shanghai Dumpling King, another one of SF's hole in the wall XLB joints. \n\nWe ordered several other dishes, some of which I actually enjoyed far more than the xlb (for just the xlb I would give this place 3 stars). \n\nOrder these:\n- Pig ears: Fantastically seasoned, chewy and tender. Served cold and was a great complement with the other hot dishes. I would order these again in a second.\n- Lamb dumpling w/ Chinese Vegetable: The lamb/veggie filling inside was delicious, and the dumpling skin was far more delicate than the xlb. Another must order dish.\n\nCould take or leave:\n- Black bean string beans; The flavor was pretty good, but they were really under-seasoned, The black bean sauce was fairly watery so it didn't really stick to the beans very well. Okay, would probably order again for a veggie dish.\n- Salt & Pepper Tofu: Again, it tasted good. The tofu was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, which is what you want. However, when this dish came out the soft insides of the tofu were hotter than the surface of the sun. I ate and entire one and just bit into it, and am still feeling the burn on the top of my mouth today. Let these cool down for a few minutes unless you want to destroy the inside of your mouth.\n\nSkip these:\n- Bei Jing Bean Paste Noodle: This is their take on black bean noodles. There was a decidedly unpleasant metallic taste that the noodles had. The noodle texture also wasn't too great. I only ate a couple spoons, and didn't want to eat any more. Definitely not one of their stronger dishes.\n- Onion pancake: The flavor was pretty good, but dense and very oily -- so much so that some of the pieces were almost transparent.

Hm, where to begin..\n\nLet's start off with walking into the restaurant.  It's like a heatwave just exploded into your face.  For my fellow yogis out there, it's literally like stepping into a Bikram studio.  Then, cram about 25-30 people into a very small space where everyone is pretty much elbow to elbow.  The back of my chair is back-to-back to the person behind me, and I am pretty much sandwiched in between the table and my chair with maybe about an inch of breathing room.  Keep in mind that you are also in a very warm and steamy environment.  While it may be great during a Bikram sesh, it's definitely not a pleasant experience when you're trying to eat.  Wonder if I can introduce them to a good contractor so they can get some ventilation in there...\n\nThen comes the service.  Ok I'm not expecting Gary Danko-level of service at a dumpling house.  I think I'm being totally reasonable.  Our waitress got into a small altercation with 3 tables.  She got orders wrong, she was not very friendly, and every time someone ordered a dish that took a bit longer than usual (i.e. if you decide to opt for pan fried dumplings versus steamed dumplings, it's may take up to 15 minutes to prepare), she would try to convince them to get something else.  And when she was unsuccessful, she would roll her eyes and stomp away.  We didn't order enough food for everyone, so we tried to get a server's attention for a menu.  Our table was in the very back corner, so it was a little difficult to flag someone down.  It took us, no joke, 10 minutes just to get someone's attention.  However, the plus side is, the food actually came out pretty quickly.  \n\nIf you don't mind all the above, I guess the redeeming quality would be the food.  The dumplings aren't the BEST I've had, but they are decent.  The prices are fairly low and servings are fairly generous, so you can order a bunch of stuff and sample different things.  Salt and pepper fried tofu is one of my staple dishes that I always order.  It was, again, decent, but it could use some garlic or some more spices to give it that extra kick; the Shanghai Dumplings were the best out of the dumplings I tried; and lastly I really enjoyed the grilled lamb skewers.  They were perfectly spiced and grilled to perfection.  \n\nPerhaps a two-star rating might be a bit harsh.  But I don't think i can give it 3 stars for an overall experience.  There are plenty of other establishments that serve delicious dumplings in a much more pleasant environment. \n\nIn sum - 2.5 stars.", "author": "Cecilia S."}

So we came here. We got here around 5:30pm on a Sunday. We pretty much beat the dinner rush. When we were eating the place filled up and there was a line when we walked out 45 minutes later. \n\nFirst off the place is ridiculously small. Probably 8- 9 four person tables. The service here is so-so. We were served after another party when we arrived before them. We ordered 2 (6) orders of XLBS, chives/pork/shrimp dumplings, and some garlic green beans to have a well-rounded meal. \n\nThe green beans came out really fast. Tasty but nothing special. \n\nMy SO loved the XLBs. They weren't steams in those little metal cups which he thinks is cheating. The skin was the right thickness- not to thin that it breaks and not too thick. The soup was tasty and the meat was prefect consistency. \n\nThe other dumplings were good too. \n\nOverall, this is an experience that everyone should experience in San Francisco.", "author": "Sarah C."}

The xiao long bao, which seems to be featured all the time on the 7x7 Big Eat list, is something I don't understand.  I can list plenty of other places where it's so much better.  The most recent visit when I ordered this reminded me why Kingdom of Dumpling never comes up when I'm craving for xiao long baos.  The meat is good, and while the soup is tasty, there wasn't much.  The horrible part was the skin.  I'm not sure what was wrong with it, but I'm pretty sure good dumpling skins aren't suppose to stick to your teeth.  \n\nWhen coming here, it's best to stick to their regular dumplings, they're tasty and juicy, and nothing was wrong with the skin.

Yeah this place may be considered hole in the wall, but their homemade dumplings, such as: Pork Dumpling w/ Green Chives, Chicken Dumplings (ANY chicken dumpling), and XLB - Soup Dumplings were superb .  'Kingdom of Dumplings' was our first stop before going to 'Dumpling Kitchen' and i have to honest here this is my first time going to any sort of dumpling related restaurant and glad our drunk logic told us it would be worth a trip (i.e. traveling from Castro to Taraval st [forgot the area name to be exact]).\n\nSorry i didn't take any photos of the dumplings, because our group instantly devoured it!\n\nNOTE: They had a really nice home made hot sauce on the side, and i believe it was mixed siracha, garlic, some chili sauce, and a dash of onion.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-11-11", "description": "I have been writing this review in my head for days.  Let me just start by saying that this is the best Chinese food I have ever had, along side with my beloved Gary Chu's in Santa Rosa, CA.  \n\nI have lived in SF for almost 10 years, searching high and low for good Chinese food and I have finally found it.  When we showed up around 7:30 on Friday night there was a line outside waiting for tables.  The wait staff came outside numberous times to bring more chairs for the waiting people to sit and asked each party personally what their name was (there was a list hanging from the door that you can just write your name and party size on), to be sure that we felt we were not being forgotten or overlooked.  The one sort-of head honcho male server was so friendly and when he sat us at a table squished in the corner, he apologised and said we could move when another one opened up- we didn't mind at all though.  The restaurant is tiny with very few tables, but you get your food quick so we only waited outside for about 15 mins tops. \n\nI noticed, what I thought were asparagus, on every table.  I looked for asparagus on the menu and didn't see it but did see Garlic Green Beans, I figued the \"asparagus\" might be really large beans and if not, the green beans would still probably be good.  Turns out they were green beans and they are the winner winner Kingdom of Dumpling dinner.  They are amazing, you MUST order these, end of story.\n\nI ordered Shanghai soup dumplings, cuz #WIR (when in rome, it's gonna be a thing, spread it around) and they were good, some might say a tad bland but really comforting and delicious, I appreciated the delicate flavor. \n\nThe potstickers were wonderful, nice and soft dough with yummy inside and one crunchy side, the vinegar dipping sauce with shallot was great with them. \n\nThe chow fun was good, I wouldn't necessarily order it again though, we got it with beef per the recommendation of our friendly server.  I would just imagine there are other more incredible dishes to try on the menu.  Next time I would like to try the green onion pancake, I get the feeling it is really great there- lots of people ordering it and I kept hearing the staff recommending it. \n\nThe real winner was the fried rice. I know that sounds crazy but I'm telling you.  You MUST order the chicken fried rice.  I told the server \" ummm we want to get some friend rice too I think\" and he matter-of-factly said \"chicken fried rice\" and wrote it down with no questions asked.  This fried rice was the most flavorful and texturally pleasing fried rice I have ever had.  It was soooo flavorful.  But the best part is the pieces of chicken are white meat, from what I noticed, but I think what they do is take skin-on chicken, render the skin and cook the meat, then probably refrigerate it.  Then they probably chop it up when ready to cook with it and throw it into a screaming hot wok.  What you end up with is moist, juicy chicken with the crispiest, thinnest layer of skin on it.  I am getting emotional just remembering it.  It was phenomenal people. \n\nI cannot wait to go back to Kingdom of Dumpling, I won't be eating friend rice anywhere else from now on!  Worth the wait, worth the slightly steeper price than neighboring Chinese fare.", "author": "Emma H."}

I haven't purchased my usual favorite vegetable buns lately because the last time I had them, they were a little dense.  Sadness.  I will give them another go the next time though.\n\nWhat usually is not available and requires special orders are the fish dumplings and shrimp and chive dumplings.  This last time they had just a few bags of these and I snatched them up.  I'm a little hesitant to try them, but they come highly recommended.\n\nCash only.  Bring a freezer bag if you're traveling from the Peninsula or South Bay like I am!  If you know what you want, you can always also call ahead and ask them to save a few bags of stuff for you.

On our list was Kingdom of Dumpling which many people claim has the best XLB in the city. \n\nWe ordered a whole slew of items, including the wings, lamb skewers, marinated beef, beef tendon, garlic green beans, chicken corn dumplings, beef pancake, XLB and fried XLB.\n\nI'm going to skip over most of it since in general most of it was average, except the wings which were below average. The fried XLB, which took an extra 30 minutes, were also average and not worth the wait. The steamed XLB were actually pretty damn good. I'm not sure if they're the best in the city as there are still many I need to try, but it was definitely one of the better ones.\n\nThe one item that I really loved though, was the beef pancakes. These were soooo good. Thick, filled with multiple layers of meat and perfectly soft yet crunchy, I ended up eating half the plate.\n\nAlso worth mentioning is the spicy house sauce in the jars on the table. I couldn't get enough of this stuff. \n\nOverall, I really liked Kingdom of Dumpling.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-07-17", "description": "Widely lauded as one of the best places in San Francisco to get dumplings, Kingdom of Dumpling had been on my to-eat list for a while. Especially the Xiao Long Bao (a.k.a. XLB or soup dumplings). I was surprised by the tininess of the space. There were 5 tables of varying sizes, with room for no more than 30, the largest tables having room for no more than 8. On a Monday night, a line of at least 10 people waited outside for coveted seats. \n\nWe decided to get takeout. The servers were understandably busy. I didn't want to wait for too long, so I forewent the radish cakes (2 per order), which would take 30 minutes to prepare. Our order was ready in 10 minutes, and we quickly drove home to eat it as freshly as possible.\n\nThe XLB, as their \"signature dish,\" was amazing--flavorful, yet delicate. Still steaming when we got home, letting them cool down helped me not to burn my tongue upon first chomp. Beware of the spurting jizz effect if you bite into it (it helps to hold it on a big soup spoon). If you let them cool down TOO much, though, the broth may solidify back into its original gelatin form (which may happen if you do takeout, though it's probably not as much of a risk when eating in). \n\nTheir dumplings are packed wonderfully fat. I love the way they cook chives in their dumplings. The chicken wings are juicy, tender, and highly recommended, I would definitely order them again. If anything, I wish they were bigger. The wings are on the lighter side for wings--not breaded, more of a light basting as opposed to doused in sauce. The flavor is like a sweet soy sauce and not very deep fried. The garlic green beans and garlic bok choy are deliciously garlicky and covered in diced garlic bits that add tons of flavor. \n\nThe prices seemed extremely reasonable. It would be cool if they sold some of their dumplings for less than 12 pieces per dish (for the friend-challenged/smaller parties), but you know they'll get eaten eventually. \n\nThe Engrish name only adds to the appeal. My only regret: I didn't get to sample more dumplings. I know I'm coming back for more.\n\n*Sources: http://www.thebolditalic.com/articles/340-the-best-chinese-dumplings-in-san-francisco \nhttp://tripque.wordpress.com/2014/03/04/food-challenge-best-soup-dumplings-%E5%B0%8F%E7%B1%A0%E5%8C%85-in-the-san-francisco-bay-area/\nhttp://blogs.sfweekly.com/foodie/2014/05/who_makes_the_better_chinese_d.php", "author": "Jade V."}

Tons of rave reviews from friends and Yelpers alike, but they've both fallen short of admittedly lofty expectations.\n\nKingdom of Dumpling epitomizes \"hole in the wall\" being a tiny restaurant in the middle of a residential area in Parkside.  After church, my family and I were lucky enough to be free around the time these guys opened so we nabbed a table right away.  Otherwise, you'll have to put your name down on a list at the front and wait accordingly.\n\nGetting the misses out of the way first, skip the Scallion Pancake and Beef Tendon Noodle Soup.  The noodles were fine, but the tendon pieces were entirely fat and the broth was terribly bland.\n\nDumplings came in dozens with fillings including pork & Chinese spinach, pork & chives and lamb.  The skins were quite well done - not excessively thick and gummy, and the meat and veggies were fresh and seasoned well.  As for the infamous xiao long bao (XLB), pretty tasty with the juices and flavor being the strong points.  The skins were borderline too thin as some of them broke open, but most held up no problem.  Unfortunately, the pork filling was very skimpy and not nearly tender enough as you could notice the gritty texture.\n\nKoD looks to be an entirely family run establishment, so don't expect particularly speedy or efficient service.  Props for taking credit card on orders over $15 though.  So the key question: Would I come back?  Good, but not great and not quite worth the trek out for a return visit.  Totally worthwhile for those who are local, but KoD certainly does not have the best XLB in the Bay Area.  Let the hunt continue!", "author": "Eric F."}

The pork and shrimp dumplings were very delicious as well, with fresh fillings and not-too-thin chewy skin. However, the XLBs that everyone raves about are not as good as I had expected. While the filling was great and there was plenty of soup, the skin was on the thick side. I think Yang Sing still does it better, but at a price premium.

I came here New Years Day and I knew this place had to be open because it is an Asian restaurant and they are always open on a holiday. I called them around 12:30 to see how long the wait would be and they said it was 20 minutes. When I arrived, there was just a huge crowd outside and there were at least 15 names in front of mine. This place is friggin SMALL with only 10 tables or so and I understood why the wait was so long. Supposedly, it was only supposed to be a 20 minute wait when I asked again (it ended up being an hour wait since people just jotted their name down and never came back). My group had 7 people so it was pretty tough getting a spot but eventually we got two tables and pushed them together. By this time, it was awkwardly 3pm so it was definitely a linner. We walked down a few blocks to get Super Cue and sipped on boba and ate Taco Bell before lunch.....hahha. We walked back and our name was actually called but he still allowed us to be seated, which was really nice since I had just missed it.\n\nOur group of 7 ordered:\n-- 4 xiao long bao (6 pieces each)- I was slight disappointed in this because that was the whole reason to go here. The dumplings are pretty flat and piping hot but I thought it was pretty average. The tip was hard and the soup and meat wasnt extremely flavorful.\n\n-- 2 fried XLB (4 pieces each)- These are just huge xiao long baos that are fried and are supposed to still have soup but these just ended up being huge fried dumplings. The skin wasnt flavorful and the meat was dry.\n\n-- 1 green onion pancake- This was probably the most tasty item since you cant really mess up a fried pancake. I liked that it came in a lot of pieces and they were all fried. I hate when the pancake is squishy since they didnt fry it all the way. I would say this one is a must. \n\n-- 1 pork dumpling with corn (12 pieces)- I wanted to try something different and saw that this dumpling had corn. No one at my table liked this one but I thought it was alright. The corn is sweet so it didnt quite mesh well with the pork. Maybe you should just get the regular dumpling with spinach or leak. \n\n-- 1 beef noodle soup- This one was pretty disappointing since the soup and meat was whatever. The noodles were soft but I wouldnt crave this at all. I would pass. \n\n-- 1 green bean- The owner suggested we get more food so we ordered a 4th XLB and a green bean. This dish was alright and I guess we needed some veggies up in here. A lot of people get this but once again it is nothing special.\n\nThis place is a cute mom and pop shop but the food wasnt up to par with the rest of the SF cuisine. Good try though. I will say that the owner is a straight up playa balla status. He said we didnt have enough food and suggested we order more even though I thought we had more than enough. We ordered two more dishes and even though we finished everything, I am sure if those two dishes werent there, we would have been completely fine. In the end, I wasnt so full that I couldnt breathe and I left satisfied. I heard the owner go to two other tables and used the same like of Oh I dont think that is enough food and they ended up ordering more. He sure is a smoother talker that can sure sell his dumplings. We got trolled by his charm but I guess it was alright since the whole thing ended up being only $65 or so. The owner was so funny and every time we made a comment to each other about the taste or after we took a bite, he briskly walked by and joined our conversation and said \"Good job!\" or other random comments. Haha this guy. Overall the food is alright and I definitely want to try the other XLB places to compare.\n\n\n**TIPS**\n1) Parking isnt that bad over here so it should be fine to drive.\n2) This place is verrry small so expect a long wait and only bring a small group.\n3) Enjoy!", "author": "Amy H."}

My friend suggested Kingdom of Dumpling insisting that their dumplings were better so we gave it a shot. We came on a Friday night, but luckily the wait was minimal. After ten minutes in the wind, we were seated inside the cramped dinning room. We spent a few minutes deciding which items we would get on the menu but it took 15 minutes for them to take our order. We flagged down the waiter a few times but he told us to wait a minute. It seems like they were swamped with to go orders.\n\nWe ordered the xiao long bao (soup dumplings), pork and cabbage dumplings, pork and chive dumplings, and beef chow fun. I had my heart set on the shanghai pan fried pork dumplings but they said it would take 45 min - 1 hr to make. Unless if they had to make it from scratched then and there or make it from frozen, I don't think it should take that long. Other places like Dumpling Kitchen whip it out within 10 minutes. They waiter asked if we ordered enough food and that we should make sure we order enough at the beginning, because we would probably have to wait an extra 20-40 minutes for a second order if we were still hungry. The fear of not having enough food caused us to order their fried chicken wings as suggested by the waiter.\n\nOur food came out 15 minutes later nice and hot. Unfortunately the taste didn't impress me too much. The skins of the dumplings didn't have a firm bite to them but rather a brittle feeling. The meat was nothing memorable and the soup of the soup dumpling was mild. The chicken wings were crisp, but the sauce didn't have a punch that would be expected.\n\nIn a nutshell: \n- The wait can be long \n- They prioritized to-go orders over taking dine in orders\n- Slow on fulfilling orders so make sure you order a good amount\n- Nothing really stood out and some dishes were a bit bland\n- The prices are affordable!", "author": "David C."}

This restaurant is only slightly bigger than a walk-in closet. The nondescript squared interior was stacked with small tables leaving very little elbow room for anyone to maneuver. The atmosphere was very festive as there was a long line of people waiting outside for a table. The servers seemed to be working on a frantic mode, and they were very kind to offer us hot tea as we looked on and drooled until seating became available for our group.\n\nWe shared Pork Dumplings with Corn (12/$6.95), Pork Dumplings with Spinach (12/$6.95), Shanghai Soup Dumplings/XLB (6/$4.95), Pork & Shrimp Dumplings with Chives (12/$6.95), Beef Stew Noodle Soup ($6.95), and String Beans ($6.95). Everything we had was outstanding and 5 stars quality. The ingredients that were used were fresh and the dumpling wrappers were spongy, flavorful, and came with a good bite. Excellent wrappers! The fillings were robust and not skimpy with the right balance of ingredients and great flavor. Furthermore, the Shanghai Soup Dumplings came with juicy squirts of flavorful broth until the rest of the steaming meaty dumpling collapse into the taste buds. From dumpling to dumpling, each bite was very consistent.\n\nI also enjoyed the Beef Stew Noodle Soup tremendously. The broth was light, flavorful and the thickness and texture of the noodles reminded me of the street vendors of Taiwan. I still prefer the same dish at Din Tai Fung, but I would not hesitate to order their Beef Noodle Soup again. As a string bean snob, I initially had under estimated this dish but it turned out perfect. The texture was stir fried to dry and there was wonderful flavor coming from the string beans itself. It was obvious that the chef knows a thing or two about the art of wok too in addition to their delicious dumplings. I was thrilled.\n\nI was torn between a 4 or 5-stars for the rating since I thought the service was very rushed and not attentive after our food arrived at the table. I also wished I could have more ginger to complement the soy sauce and dumplings, so those who are interested shouldn't expect too much from the service when dining here. Instead, their strength is at providing our group with taste and value that comes with a good price tag. All of us left the restaurant full and satisfied.

Everyone outside is waiting to be called in. \n\nLuckily the wait was not too long, as I was foaming at the mouth to get some soup dumplings, something I have not had since I was in Shanghai. I was sat in the very corner with little room to move. I was boxed in and sharing a table with 2 strangers.

They tasted so yummy. I did not care to dissect them, but instead just shovel the bliss into my mouth-hole. Mmmmm. \n\nJust as quick as the dumplings came, they were in my belly and I was a very happy man.

I came here around 6pm on a Saturday and luckily there were only three parties ahead of us! Once we were seated we ordered:  \n\n-- Lamb Dumpling with Chinese Vegetable - I've never had lamb dumplings anywhere else, but I liked this dish. The meat didn't have the gamey after-taste that most lamb dishes have, which could make it appealing to both lamb-lovers and non-lamb-lovers alike.   \n-- Xiao Long Bao (Shanghai Dumpling) - This was my favorite dish by far. Perfectly seasoned meat and soup inside a delicate steamed bun. The bun was thick enough so that it wouldn't break when you picked it up, but still very soft and thin. \n-- Beef Pancake - Also a great dish, soft beef stacked inside a crispy green onion pancake. It went really well with the house-hot sauce. \n\nI would give this place a five star, but the service is not the best (who said a Chinese restaurant can't have great service?!), the restaurant is pretty cramped, hot, and a little dirty.

Everything was prepared fresh and came out piping hot. The Salt and Pepper Tofu could have used more consistent seasoning but the texture was perfectly crisp. All the dumplings were delicious! Great flavors in the pork dumplings and the shrimp and chive dumplings were subtle and tasty. For some reason even the green tea tasted extra good. Great low key food experience. \n\nI'd give four stars except for the waiter experience. We got there at 3PM: \n\nA very nice pregnant woman who knows the staff and may be part of the business noticed we weren't being acknowledged and got the waiter's attention. She was super sweet and apologetic. \n\nBeware any waiter there that tells you the kitchen is closing and if you want anything else better \"order now\" - when there's 30min before the kitchen closes. Our waiter wouldn't take no for an answer when he tried pushing all sorts of dishes on us. When I said I'd like to hold onto one menu, we may order something else in a few minutes - He said No, and took both menus away. We thought hmm, pretty hard core about closing the kitchen, but it's their kitchen so fair enough. \n\nAt 3:20 and 3:25 three more people were seated and placed orders! \n\nAfter that we felt like he delayed greeting us to shorten the time window so we'd feel pressured to order tons of dishes before the kitchen closed.  All he had to do was let us place our first round of orders, rather than act - admonishing - and take our menus away when we didn't order every dish he recommended. I was thinking of ordering food to go but not from that waiter and anyway he took the menu away. Silly. \n\nWe love tasty small local places and this is one of them.  \n\nThey are worth checking out! And the other staff seem to be more in tune with basic customer service. We're not looking for white glove treatment and I can tell that waiter is not a reflection of the rest of the business. But he did cost them a bigger order from a random walk-in on a Wed afternoon.", "author": "D G."}

Was I being too harsh?\n\nBut a recent visit just reconfirmed my original review. The shanghai soup dumplings were good though the broth tasted a bit fatty. The other dumplings - vegetarian, pork with chives, shrimp, shanghai fried - were all good too but not great. 3.5 stars for the food though the value for money bumps that up to 4 stars.\n\nSo why just 2 stars? Weird weird service. They're super good about splitting up and combining tables to fit parties as they come and go. When we arrived we waited around 15-20 minutes for a table right next to the door. Fine. We can sit next to the open door on a cold night. No big deal. \n\nFirst guy who served us was super nice but also super pushy. He kept asking us if we wanted to order a specific dish while we were ordering. Like, we would ask \"can we have 2 orders of XLB?\" and he would reply \"how about the chicken with corn dumplings too?\". This happened several times. At the end he shook his head indicating he didn't think we ordered enough food. When we told him we would eat what we ordered then get more if we wanted that wasn't good enough. He kept pushing us to order more food and we had to again tell him that we would - later. Fine. Whatever. Pushy staff. We can live with this.\n\nAt some point our server leaves and we get another guy. We order some more dishes okay. But then we want to order the shanghai fried dumplings they tell us that they just ran out. Okay. So we order some other dumplings. After some time the shanghai fried dumplings come out to us (surprise!) but the other dumplings don't. We ask about the other dumplings and they say \"no more\" - which we take to mean they ran out. So then after some discussion at our table we pick out a different type of dumpling to order. Only to be told again \"No\". We were extremely confused so we asked if they meant they ran out. The guy practically yells at us \"No more orders. You have to leave. There are people waiting\". What? Even though we're ordering tons more food we can't stay and eat? How come we're the only ones being hustled out the door when there are people who've been sitting down as long as us?\n\nTotally rude. 2 stars. NOT GOING BACK.", "author": "Jean K."}

This is going to be good!\" The meal was indeed good, if not great. Every time I've gone, I've always ordered the same thing - pork and chive dumpling, XLB, and chive pancake. There was one occasion that we ordered the shrimp and chive too, which was good, but I am not much of a shrimp eater, so I can't say much on them. \n\nPeople say that dumplings in LA, specifically SGV, are better than here in SF -I beg to differ. I've been to the popular Mama Lu's and was impressed, but not where I thought the dumplings were superior. Yes, the skins are thicker at KOD, but the overall flavor I felt was better than that of ML's. I will say that ML's meat is processed and prepared better. Meaning, there isn't pieces of gristle that you occasionally find at KOD. \n\nThe dumplings always come out steaming hot and are tender. The orange chili sauce is like crack and I dip to my heart's fiery content. The chive pancakes are good here, although, I will say, that the outer skin is a bit too thick for this dish. Also, the pancakes aren't ever consistent. Sometimes they have a pronounced garlic and chive flavor, other times they have a more mild veggie taste, and the last time I got them they had a fishy taste to them :/ \n\nThe XLB are yummy!  They have great flavor and the filling is tender. However, I have had better tasting XLB at Shanghai Dumpling, but that's it from that place. Everything else I enjoy more at KOD. \n\nThe reason I gave three out of five stars is because this place needs to work harder on their consistency in flavor, refining the way they make their filling, and getting some ventilation in that place!  The window is always steamy, lol!", "author": "Josh S."}

There wasn't a single redeeming thing about this dish. \n\nWe also ordered the lamb dumpling and chives which weren't bad.

I grew up eating and making dumplings with my grandma, and these dumplings at KoD are. For. Real.\n\nI can't even describe how good they are; they're perfect. When you enter this hot and muggy little restaurant, you'd never know it, but you're actually entering Dumpling Nirvana.\n\nMeditate while you bite into that pork and shrimp dumpling. Close your eyes and just focus on the plump, tender skin and the wonderful meaty filling while the crisp green onions and fresh shrimp pop in your mouth. Add some of that ginger and vinegar that they serve you before you even order, and some of that orange peppery hot sauce in an almost empty jar on the side, and it'll fly you to the moon.\n\n---\n\nEverything we ordered was around $5-$6, so we went all out:\n\n1) Green Onion Pancake - crispy, flaky, oniony, cut into 8 pieces, enough to share between two people. It's a simple appetizer, and they do it well.\n\n2) Five Spice Beef - a platter of thinly sliced, marinated beef. This is a very traditional homey Chinese dish that goes really well with the pancakes (think, Shandong beef rolls, basically). Really tender, moist, flavorful. Solid.\n\n3) Pork & Shrimp Dumplings - MY FAVORITE. I love that every dumpling had a good sized chunk of shrimp in it, and it tasted so fresh. The texture of the crisp veggies and the pop once you bite in to the shrimp, with the flavor of the pork. Just. Heavenly.\n\n4) Lamb & Green Onion Dumplings - This one was solid as well, but I don't think the lamb flavor really came through, it was more mushy in texture than the pork which holds together a little better.\n\n5) Shanghai Soup Dumplings (Xiao Long Bao) - These were good, but not the best I've had. The skin is more akin to dumpling skins (too thick), tasty, but not what an XLB should be like. The soup is tasty and will coat your lips with its wonderful fattiness :) And the meat is good, but very basic. Order one just to try it, but I wouldn't come here just for these.\n\n---\n\nSo, if you don't mind circling a few blocks for parking and waiting for maybe 10 minutes outside to walk into a sauna with small sticky tables and little squeaky chairs and waving down a rather curt and sweaty server, you'll find a nice reward at the end of this ordeal once you have their AMAZING, PERFECT DUMPLINGS.\n\nAlso, just a note: Their new location at 2048 Taraval is \"to-go\" dumplings only, which means, they're DIY take-home-to-make dumplings, as in, you can't eat the dumplings there.

Those are bad choices and merely distractions on the road to dumplings, and that's probably how the owners feel, too.\n\nI came here on a saturday afternoon, and it was packed. My friends ordered dumplings and I ordered the special - prawns and eggplant. Theirs came out in 5-10 minutes. They were both done with eating their food items when mine finally came out. The owner was nice in letting me know that it took awhile, but when I asked if I could just take it to go, he kind of did one of those, \"ehh...\" like I couldn't take something to go. It felt like there was too much going on for them to accommodate someone who hadn't just ordered the dumplings.\n\nThe prawns and eggplant were meh. Kinda tasted like a little more flavorful thing you'd get at a Panda Express. The dumplings were delicious and fresh and pretty cheap.\n\nThe thing that's the worst is that to get to the bathroom, you have to go through their kitchen, which is small and full of people and boiling pots of water. I can't believe that's not illegal. This building was not designed to be a restaurant. I can see why they've got a 72/100 health code score.

Here is a breakdown of the stuff I get:\n\nAppetizers:\nCold wide bean noodle: it's one of those things you're like... What could this possibly be? It's this noodle made of mung beans and it's flat and chewy, kinda like a firmer rice noodle. It's doused with sesame oil, garlic, and packed with flavor. They're also topped with cucumber shreds for an excellent dish when it's hot out (or inside). \n\nSalt and pepper tofu: pretty good, but I've had better elsewhere. They're tiny little morsels with lots of fried outer bits and only a dash of the salt and pepper flavor. If you're into that, then this is for you. I like bigger pieces with more flavor, but that's just my preference.\n\nDumplings:\nPork and Shrimp Dumplings with Chives: super delicious if you like chives! Also, it goes great with the habanero sauce that they have on the table (it's that orange thing) if you're into hot sauce. I've been trying to get them to bottle that stuff for years, but they won't do it. (Sad for me.) They make that sauce fresh every week, but I digress.\n\nShanghai Soup Dumplings: flavorful and soupy, but they come out super hot, so watch your tongue or you might get burned.\n\nVegetarian Dumplings: for friends that don't eat meat, I'd wish they put more variety in these dumplings, like ginger, woodear mushrooms, or shiitake mushrooms, but they mostly consist of cabbage. They're nice and crunchy though, and vegetarians won't complain about having a dumpling option. :)\n\nOther:\nGarlic string bean: the texture is firm and it's a staple every time I come. I will never come here to not get this. It's a mix of soy, garlic, and magic. It's delicious. If you ever look around the restaurant, you'll see that half of the people will order this.\n\nShanghai Donut: \nA light and flaky bun with sesame seeds on top, filled with ground up, sweet, black sesame filling. It's delicious and there's two in every order. One for you and one for a friend. The perfect snack to end the dinner!", "author": "Amy N."}

The soup came with a good amount of wontons, bok choy, shiitake mushrooms, and wide rice noodles.  The broth was okay.  It could have used a bit more seasoning.  The wontons had a good taste and the wrapper was cooked just right.  The onion pancake wasn't memorable.  It had a few pieces of green onion here and there.  I dipped it into the hot sauce that was on the table.  Be careful.  It's tangy and very spicy!\n\nAs I finished my two dishes, I noticed that the table beside me had ordered the lamb skewers.  They looked like they were enjoying it and I love lamb skewers!  Even though the waiter who took my order said they only take one order, I asked the waitress if I could order the lamb skewers to go.  She obliged and said I would have to wait.  I was fine with that.  I brought the box of lamb skewers to my car and ate two skewers.  Oh, they were so delicious!

But after I see the enticing specials, we decided to go a different route and ordered the Curry Duck Stew with a bowl of white rice. For $9.95, I get pieces of boneless duck meat with chunks of Green Zucchini and Eggplants in a somewhat spicy sauce.

I had been hyping this place up to them so much that they thought I gave them unrealistic expectations but they soon understood why I love this place so much.\n\nFirst off, get the xiao long bao. Don't even look at the menu, just start off ordering that. They will be some of the best XLB that you'll ever have. On top of that we had some pork and celery dumplings (my mom is oddly obsessed with celery) and they were delicious as well.\n\nGet the scallion pancakes as well, won't go wrong. The jellyfish is the best jellyfish that I've ever had - and I've had a lot. Black fungus with garlic was also amazing. The cilantro bean noodle was incredible! I had never had it before but now it is something that I will be coming here for.\n\nThe place is really small, so make sure to be either prepared to wait for a table or a really small place. They don't have many tables, so if you have to wait, just wait! It well be well worth it!\n\nFor the more adventurous, get the pigs ears. Now, I love pigs ears already. It's a great snack to pick up from chinatown when you need a snack and it's one of my dad's favorite treats. My mom, sister and boyfriend all think we're insane. Well not anymore! They all tried the pigs ears and loved them! So don't go \"ew, you're so weird, I don't trust this girl because she eats pigs ears\", just order them, eat them and you can thank me later.

I'm actually craving some more dumplings by just thinking about reviewing it right now. Unfortunately it's 10pm and they're already closed and a bit of a drive. We planned ahead and had a friend wait in line for us and the total wait for the 5 of us was around 40 minutes. We were kind of worried that we weren't going to be able to sit together because this place is SMALL! There are only 2 tables that can accomodate a group of 5 with about 6 other tables that are good for couples....so keep that in mind.\n\nThe server was hilarious and very jovial. He's making a lot of money from all the dumplings he's selling. I found it interested that a Lexus SUV rolled up delivering extra dumplings and I think they actually handmake all the dumplings offsite and bring it in...kind of odd I know! Did I mention this place was small? Standing outside in the rain you can just feel the hot air coming out of the restaurant. Plan on taking all your layers of clothes off when you sit down.\n\nThe food! Started off with the XLB and wasn't impressed at all. I compare all dumplings now to Mama Lu's in Alhambra and this place just doesn't even compare. The XLB are small and the skins were all irregular shaped and didn't really hold their soup at all. The string beans were good and I would prefer getting that over the cucumber. My favorite variety would probably be the pan friend dumplings. They were the largest and the most flavorful. The beef noodle soup was also pretty good but wish the noodles were the thicker kind. The noodles served here almost reminded me of ramen.\n\nAll in all, I think the place is good. At least this place isn't called \"King of Dumpling\" because that would be a misnomer...but Kingdom of Dumpling is a fitting name and I'll definitely come back when I have to get my dumpling fix.

The dumpling doesn't break apart and there is a decent amount of soup swirling inside. I consider those the two most important qualities for this dish.

When we busted out the cupcakes, the owner flipped the lights off for the whole restaurant and got the whole crowd singing Happy Birthday with us.

These are some of the best dumplings I've had in the Bay Area (other than my mama's kitchen).    \n\nTwo of my cuzzos live within walking distance to the Kingdom. We strolled down Taraval on a Saturday around 1pm for a late lunch. Of course, the Kingdom was packed inside and had a few groups of people waiting outside. There is no room to even wait inside. That is how small the place is. We put our names down on the list and waited on the sidewalk. Girl talk ensued for about 40 minutes. As we watched happy patrons leave sporadically, our hopes got higher and higher. Finally, our turn came to go inside and we were seated by the door. It was super cramped and warm in there and you can definitely smell the hot grease coming out of the kitchen. Every time someone opened the door, the door would hit the back of my chair. But all was forgiven because cuzzos and I were on this mission to consume some dumplings. \n\nWe ordered the shanghai soup dumplings (xao long bao), pork and chive dumplings and the salt and pepper tofu. The dumplings looked amazing and were so delicious!  The pork stuffing on both dumplings had great flavor and the handmade dumpling wrappers were the perfectly thin, not too doughy. The salt and peper tofu was crispy on the outside and soft inside. Yummy! One of my cuzzos even got another dumpling order to go for her husband at home. \n\nThe prices are super affordable. Service was good. Great late lunch overall. Next time, I'll be sure to go right when they open to avoid the long wait. I definitely want to try their other dumplings and Shanghai dishes.", "author": "Liv A."}

We had heard good things about this place and our friend (who lives around the corner and has been before) said they usually have a line out the door.  We had previously been to Dumpling Kitchen during an earlier visit and I was excited to see how this compared.\n\nWhile standing outside waiting, I was noticing all of the accolades the restaurant has received (articles posted in the window, etc.)  When they opened, we were the first to be seated and we waited about 10 minutes before anyone came over to take our order, even though our menus had been put down on the table 5 minutes earlier.\n\nWe ordered:\nShanghai Dumpling (2 orders)\nPork and Napa Cabbage Dumpling\nCrispy Chicken Wings (because they told us the Green Onion Pancake was unavailable)\n\nThe Shanghai dumplings arrived first and I noticed the skins at the bottom were very thin and fragile such that they would break when trying to pick the dumpling up.  This resulted in the loss of all of the liquid which was not a good thing.  Also, the tops of the dumplings had large amounts of dough where the dumpling was sealed.  Some of these \"knots\" at the top didn't taste fully cooked.\n\nThe Pork and Napa Cabbage dumplings arrived next.  They were good, but nothing spectacular.  Seemed to me to be run of the mill.\n\nThe Crispy Chicken Wings arrived third and although they didn't look all that crispy, there was a slight crunch to the skins.  The sauce was pretty tasty, but again, nothing spectacularly out of this world.\n\nWe finished up most of the food and were chatting when another Pork and Napa Cabbage dumpling plate was delivered.  We let them know we didn't order it and they took it away.  After that, a Green Onion Pancake arrived.  Apparently after they told us they didn't have any, they decided to put the order in anyway.  The gentleman that brought it out told us that it takes 30 minutes to prepare, but had we known that we were going to get the pancake, we would not have ordered the chicken wings.\n\nThey removed the pancake from our bill and we paid and left.  I was thoroughly unimpressed with the food and service.  I'm guessing all of the accolades had led to laziness and the food and service that had brought them all of the awards no longer exists.

Just come when you're hungry and hope there's not a long wait.\n\n---\n\nMy mom is from NE China (aka. home of fat dumplings and tall women), so I've literally had dumplings as soon as I could eat solid food. During Chinese New Year, my mom used to go to the bank to exchange completely new coins to be added to the filling and randomly wrapped into dumplings. The people who get the coins in their dumplings during the big family dinner is supposed to have a prosperous new year :)\n\nKingdom of Dumpling (KOD for short) is quite good, on par with Prosperity Dumpling in NYC if you've ever been there. They have a lot of variations so you'll probably find something you like.\n\nI love the cabbage and pork dumpling here - it's well balanced and perfectly seasoned. Napa cabbages usually emit a lot of water when cooked so even my mom's cabbage/pork dumplings tend to be soggier when she makes them, but you don't really find that at KOD. They're just perfect bursts of flavor and joy here :)\n\nIf you want a more nuanced taste, just replace cabbage with chives. Note they're not the western chives that you see on top of smoked salmon sometimes. Chinese chives have a stronger flavor, kind of like a mild green onion - it's great, try it! There, I've described for you the two big Chinese dumpling staples - cabbage and chives.\n\nOf course, depending on your dietary habit you could swap pork out for shrimp or chicken or even beef/lamb. I don't think I've ever tried a beef dumpling at KOD but their lamb dumplings were a surprising let-down (actually kind of bland). Their shrimp one is also good (although still a stretch from the pork IMO), if you want to switch things up a bit.\n\nOne of the things that I didn't discover until my 5th or 6th visit here is their GARLIC STRING BEANS. I'll just leave it at that and leave you to discover for you its greatness. We had to get two orders of that because it was just so good. The baby bok choy is a milder version of the string beans (and less oily :P), just FYI.\n\nIf you come by yourself, I'd recommend getting a boiled dumpling, another type of dumpling*, and you're good to go. It'll come out to about $15, but you'll feel great after washing everything down with a pot of tea :)\n\n* other dumpling assessments:\nXiao Long Bao - they have the funniest shaped XLBs I've ever seen...they're shaped like little turrets. They're not bad, but they're also not ridiculously good. Try it once and decide if you want to keep getting it - it's good to switch things up a bit and have a steamed dumpling though.\n\nPan-fried versions - a hot oily griddle + dumpling is a match made in heaven\n\nor you can also just get another order of boiled dumpling. or two. ;)\n\nps. The wait can be kind of long at lunch/dinner rush hours so try to come at an off time if you can. It'll save a lot of waiting since the restaurant is really small and there's no covered area to wait.

While we're not fond of crowds or lines, it's usually a good sign at a restaurant. Also a good sign - all of the patrons were Chinese (points to the food being authentic). \n\nWe were seated soon enough. It was chilly outside, yet the kitchen made the dining room feel like the inside of a furnace. Thank goodness I dressed in layers. \n\nThe owner, managed the room with the theatrical flourish of a ringmaster, and alternated between greeting people, seating people, and taking orders. Since he was so busy, when you're ready to order, you have to be assertive to get his attention. When placing your order, stand tough. No matter what you've already decided on, he'll attempt to cajole you into also ordering an extra appetizer or one of their other specialties. My husband and I weren't prepared for the onslaught, and I'll sheepishly admit we ended up ordering 6 dishes between the 2 of us (lotsa leftovers!). I've listed them below FROM BEST TO WORST.\n\n1) STEAMED XIAO LONG BAO - This is what we came for, and they didn't disappoint.  The hot, juicy little buns had just the right balance of meat and fat. The wrapping could stand to be thinner, but then I'm holding them to a high bar against the likes of Ding Tai Fong.\n \n2) SESAME PANCAKE WITH STEWED BEEF - Just like what I ate at home growing up. My husband couldn't get enough of this. Word to the wise: if you like spice, try it dipped it in their secret hot sauce. \n\n3) GRILLED LAMB SKEWERS - This is apparently a popular street food in Beijing. Smoky cumin is the standout flavor and the meat itself is really tender. But I didn't like the occasional mouthful of fat. I would have been happy eating 1 skewer, no more.  \n\n4) GARLIC STRING BEANS - These were yummy, but nothing special.\n\n5) PORK, SHRIMP, AND CHIVE DUMPLINGS - For a place called Kingdom of Dumpling, I had high expectations. However, ours were overcooked. Several of the skins had broken apart and were mushy to the bite. The saving grace was that the few intact ones had a good amount of juice, like in the xiao long bao. \n\n6) PORK & CHINESE SPINACH WONTON SOUP WITH WIDE RICE NOODLES - Uber bland. We ordered this because many other patrons had ordered it. Big mistake. The broth was straight up chicken broth. The wonton skins were mushy and as flavorless as the broth.\n\nAll in all, the dishes were a little hit or miss and I didn't care for the up-selling, especially when we already had too much food. However, I would consider coming back some day.", "author": "Cindy T."}

Not else much to say so I'll just describe the food my friend & I ordered:\n\nShanghai Soup Dumplings ($4.95 for 6): they were ok. Kind of dry on the outside.. I think the ones from House of Dumpling are more better.\n\nShrimp & Green Chive Dumplings ($6.95 for 12): I could barely taste the shrimp so it tasted like I was just eating chive dumplings. Weren't that great either.\n\nBeef Chow Fun ($6.95): Decent chow fun. Super oily. Yum... natural chapstick.\n\nSesame Pancake with Marinated Beef ($5.95 for 2): not bad. I didn't want this but my friend ordered it so it wasn't of my preference so I don't really have much to comment.\n\nAltogether our bill was about $27.00.

The tables were very small and there was only about 7 tables. They were very close to each other.. when we walked to our table in the back corner we had to apologize to all the people we made get up and lift their chairs. The waitresses were not super friendly.

They waitresses had a bit of an attitude.The only good thing about this place was that it had Xiao Long Bao!\n\nXiao Long Bao (Shanghai Soup Dumpling) $4.95: One order came with six dumplings. The good thing is that this reminded me of Din Tai Fung, because their dumpling can hold the meat and the soup in there. A couple did crack, but it was still tasty. \nX.O. Beef ChowFun $6.25: Fat flat noodles fried with beef and bean sprouts. It was aite... not flavorful and came with a MASSIVE amount of bean sprouts. \n\nIn short...\n\nPro:\n-good Xiao Long Bao, aka Shanghai Soup Dumpling\n-decent prices\n-easy parking at night\n\nCon:\n-crowded small restaurant\n-limited seats\n-forgetful waitresses\n-long wait for big groups\n-only accepts credit card over $15", "author": "Chena N."}

My favorites are the lamb, corn and pork, and if you are vegetarian try out the chives with eggs. \nAll the other food here is really good too. Try the beef pancake (yumm), string beans, noodles, lamb skewer, Shanghai soup dumpling, spicy beef tendon (my list can go on and on)...as for dessert the sesame bun is sooo good! \n\nThe wait can be a pain in the...yeah. Don't come here during lunch or dinner time. I usually go a bit earlier to avoid the long wait.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-09-15", "description": "Dumplings are the perfect hangover cure, so when our trusty Yelp app showed Kingdom of Dumpling as the #1 choice, we had to head over across town to try it. \n\nIf there's any restaurant that's the true definition of a whole in the wall, this is it. A small sign hangs on top of the entrance to the tiny room meant to fit no more than about 20 people. Yet at 10am on Sunday morning, it already has a waiting list. \n\nEverything is made with fresh ingredients and by hand. The people behind the dishes and dumplings have been making them for generations, so they know what they're doing. If you take a peek in the back room where all the magic happens, you will see a scene out of a typical Chinese dumpling store, with each dumpling carefully hand crafted.\n\nOn to the food:\n\n- Lamb Dumplings: Phenomenal. You just can't go wrong with a lamb dumpling. Juicy and flavorful just how they should be.\n\n- Vegetable Potstickers: We had to get this for the vegetarians in the group, but I still got a try. These are filled with delicious vegetables goodness and grilled to perfection. The perfect dish for a vegetarian here.\n\n- Stuffed Green Onion Pancakes: I'm used to cooking the ones they sell at Ranch 99, but the ones here surpassed those in quality. I didn't even know you could stuff them in the first place. The filling here seems to be with veggies and egg, which combine together wonderfully.\n\n- Egg Rolls: Pretty standard, yet still delicious. Nothing to complain about.\n\n- Beef Noodle & Beef Tendon Soup: This was for the two ladies who suffered the worst hangover, and everyone knows soups are a perfect hangover cure, which is why Pho is typically the #1 choice. I didn't get to try too much of them, but I remember the broth as being very delicious and the soups were packed with hefty chunks of meat. \n\n- Lamb Skewers: Although a bit spicy, these were unforgettable. I'm a sucker for anything lamb, especially on a skewer. These were marinated, thoroughly grilled, and just overall delicious. Many American places tend to screw up lamb, but that was definitely not the case here.\n\nHow does such a small place attain almost 1000 reviews and such a high rating? Come by and see.

(Because I didn't learn the first time.)\n\nFirst stomach churning experience: I just didn't feel right after eating dinner. And after a while of my full stomach growling at me, I spent a good amount on the toilet. Yay for unwanted bowel movements.\n\nSecond stomach churning experience: Because I LOVED this place so much and it had done me right before, I had to BEG my boyfriend to come back to this place again because he had endured the same thing as me from our first bad experience. Reluctantly, hungry, and grumpy, he agreed. I love it when I win! :) Little did I know that everything was going to go horribly wrong. \n\nWe ordered less than normal: chicken wings, string beans, soup dumplings, and a noodle soup. Here's the order of which everything came out: string beans... noodle soup..... and soup dumplings. Why the hesitation? Because it took forever for each dish to come out. Are we really going to scarf down string beans first as an appetizer? No, you have to wait to pair it with something else! Not very good to pair it with soup, either. Oh what happened to our chicken wings? They NEVER CAME OUT. We finished our entire dinner and couldn't wave down anyone for a refill on our water. They walked back and forth, right passed us and ignored us every time we said \"excuse me.\" We were sitting RIGHT NEXT TO THE KITCHEN DOOR. \n\nIt took the waitress 10 min to finally come over (after we were done with our meal). We asked for the check and told them we no longer want the wings. She had panic in her eyes. She literally took two steps back and stuck her head into the kitchen (this is how close we were) and said, \"hey, hurry up with the wings.\" Yeah, that's right. I'm chinese. I understand you. She told us that it will be right out. We had to argue with her for 5 minutes that we just want the check because we already finished eating. *arguing in the kitchen* Check comes out minus the wings that failed to fly. What a bad feeling in our stomachs. We realized a little later, yep, it's LITERALLY a bad feeling in our stomach and we spend the night on the toilet again. #notwinning Finally scarred for life, I had to let go of my favorite (& overhyped) dumpling place. \n\nAbout a year later, I finally gave another dumpling place a shot- it's literally one block down.

As we came later in the day, we were seated within several minutes.\n\nFOOD:\n*XLB (3 orders): YUMMY! The XLB was perfectly bundled in its wrapper and steamed. The wrapper was a little thicker in texture than the ones from Shanghai Dumpling King, so it was a lot more sturdy and didn't fall apart and/or rip when you picked it up. The savory soup was bursting with flavor and the pork filling was moist, tender, and very flavorful. The accompanying soy vinegar ginger sauce was a perfect complement as it gave a salty, sweet, and tangy punch to the XLB.\n\n*Pan-fried XLB: Good! This XLB's wrapper was thicker and resembled and tasted more like a mini pan-fried pork bun. The wrapper was nice and crisp on the bottom and soft in the center. The pork filling was similar to the steamed XLB and was still moist and very flavorful despite not having the soup in it.\n\n*Beef Pancake: OMG--SOO GOOD! Who doesn't like a beef cake?!?! Lol! It was essentially a triple layer of a thin, crisp pancake filled with two thin flavorful beef patties. Their homemade creamy garlic chili sauce was a perfect complement to the pancake.\n\n*Green Chive Pancake: It was good! This was basically a chinese version of a pita wrap. The pancake was crisp and a nice doughy texture to it and was generously stuffed with a green onions and QQ noodles (clear vermicelli noodles). All the flavors were really subtle, so you must dip it on the garlic chili sauce.\n\n*Pork w/ Napa Cabbage Dumplings: GOOD! The dumplings wrapper was slightly thicker than a wonton wrapper and was al-dente. The pork filling was very moist, juicy, and flavorful. It went very well with the soy vinegar ginger sauce.\n\n*Shrimp and Chive Dumplings: It was just ok. The same wrapper was used as the pork dumpling. There was more chive than anything, so I didn't really taste the shrimp.\n\n*Shrimp and Pork Wonton Soup w/ Wide Noodles: Perfect hangover food! The wontons were perfectly cooked leaving an al-dente skin; the filling which was mainly pork was moist and flavorful. The broth was DELISH and was definitely very pure; none of that MSG killer. The wide noodles (chow fun) noodles were cooked al-dente which gave it a nice bite. \n\n*XO Beef Chowfun: YUM! Although I didn't taste any components of XO sauce (dried scallop, fish, shrimp, chili paste, garlic, and etc), it was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The noodles were al-dente and wasn't too oily. The beef was tender and flavorful, although there very few pieces of it. The bean sprouts and green onions gave it a nice crunch and freshness to the dish.\n\nPRICES:\n*Apps (i.e. pancakes): $3.95-$4.95\n*Dumplings (4-12 pieces): $4.95 to $6.95\n*Noodle soups/Noodle Dishes: $5.95-$6.95\n\nWe ordered 10 dishes among 4 people (yes, our eyes were and always BIGGER than our stomachs) and it came to $20/person including tip and we had leftovers to feed another 3 people.\n\nSERVICE:\nPretty good for a hole-in-the-wall. The manager/owner (?) was very friendly and even demonstrated on how to properly eat a XLB. Initially, they sat us at the back table near the kitchen which reeked of vinegar and he gladly let us move to another table when another party had left.\n\nThe first dish came out in 5-7 minutes and each dish after than came out in 4-5 min increments.\n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR:\nKOD is epitome of a hole-in-the wall. It's tiny and can accommodate about 20-24 people. The sticky tables are very close to each other, so don't be surprised if the table next to you bumps you with their chair. The place does reek of pungent vinegar, but you get use to the smell within 10 minutes or so.\n\nPARKING:\nSince it's located in Outer Sunset/Parkside, street parking is a little easier to come by than the Inner Sunset. But, nonetheless, do expect to circle around especially during peak lunch hour.\n\nKOD, I *bow down* to you!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

It's good for 1 - 4 people but if you come in groups larger than that then expect to wait or get seated in separate tables. \n\nI ordered the onion pancake and beef chowmein  ($11.80 tax included) which was decent to share with another person or two people but if you're starving and haven't eaten anything all day then it's good for one. \n\nThere was only one server who was taking all the food orders so expect a little wait as well hence will give you enough time to thoroughly read the menu and/or look at yelp reviews for recommendations or pictures through your smart phone. \n\nAll in all, I'd recommend  anyone who's down to try something new but not more than a patty of 4!! Plus, the food was delicious and I would definitely come back again to try their signature dish which is their homemade dumplings :-)", "author": "Chris Z."}

What quality dumpling house serves XLB when half of them are basically ruined? My friend really liked the beef and carrot dumplings but I preferred the pork and chive ones.\n\nSkip the green onion pancake. Our neighbor ordered the beef pancake and it looked so much better. Also, you can only put in ONE order of food because they don't want you to take forever at your table, so if you're eyeing something, order it from the get go because you won't get a chance after you submit your initial order.\n\nOur group of three came a little before 6:30 and only had to wait ten minutes. We would have been there earlier but we accidentally went to the Kingdom of Dumpling grocery store first.  By the time we were done the line was well out the door and the weather was freezing and so so so windy.

I didn't love it, but that might just be my personal taste.\n\nThe soup dumplings (xiao long boa) were awesome and so juicy.\n\n There isn't a wait for lunch, but always one for dinner.

Here is what I ordered on a Sunday afternoon.\n\nXiao Long Bao (6 pieces) $4.95: I like XLB to have a very think layer of skin. This was sooo thick that it was not soupy inside if you let it sit there past 5-10mins! I picked one up right away, punctured a hole in it, poured the soup onto my soup spoon.... it had tons of soup! I was excited and love the first XLB! Then 2-3 mins later, I picked up another XLB and it had half the soup as the first one. 7-10 mins after receiving our XLB, I picked up one more and this one had no soup at all! I am sad that the thickness of the XLB skin soaked up the soup inside of the bao just after 10 mins of getting it! http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/f5sicAwCzSC11yFAdmoREQ/l.jpg\n\nPork with chives dumplings (12 pieces) ~$6: this was really good, this was actually the reason why I didn't make this place two stars. Dumpling skin is meant to be a bit thick and I loved that each dumpling had juices in it when you take a bite into it. Even the last dumpling I ate was still moist inside (way better than XLB). http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uvtt_kl5TBE2ZmohJs7hUQ/l.jpg\n\nXO Beef Chow Fun $6.95: 4-5 pieces of meat?!? That was a joke and they shouldn't label it as XO Beef Chow Fun because it isn't. It is just regular beef chow fun with a lot of bean sprouts and not enough onions and beef.  This dish was just a bit too bland for me. I had to add a lot of hot sauce for it to even have some taste to it. Just see for yourself! http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ahhjmilfYKJ2ipeMgF1TlA/l.jpg\n\nThe table hot sauce: something about it made me want to eat more of it... maybe it had garlic in it, but I just couldn't stop using it.

But Kingdom of Dumpling just didn't cut it for the three of us.\n\nWanting to eat somewhere near my friend's pad and slightly craving Asian food, we came here as it had pretty high ratings and seemed to be packed with people whenever we had walked or driven by. We came by around 1 pm on a Monday and there was only one table dining. The restaurant is incredibly small, able to seat 9-10 parties, as well as incredibly hot inside. We were quickly seated and given menus. The three of us decided to share xiao long bao, shen jien bao, and beef noodle soup.\n\nWe should've known not to order BNS in a restaurant owned by mainlanders as the Taiwanese make the best, but I figured why not; it can't be that bad. I was right, it wasn't terrible but it certainly wasn't delicious. Edible at best. The soup was filled with mushrooms, something I've never seen in BNS, and the aroma of it was way too strong. The XLB were okay. I've had better at even the worst places in LA. The skin was thick and the soup was barely existent. Definitely wouldn't order again. The best thing was probably the shen jian bao, but even then, that's really not saying much.\n\nBy the time we left, there were four other parties dining and they were all non-Asian. I'm convinced most of the rave reviews are written by people who weren't raised on authentic Chinese and Taiwanese food. With that said, come here for a quick Chinese food fix if you're in the area, but don't expect anything spectacular.", "author": "Ivy W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-07-13", "description": "Kingdom of Dumpling can't figure out what kind of Chinese restaurant it is. Is it Shanghainese? Is it Northern? Is it Cantonese? Is it Taiwanese? The staff are no help. They range from speaking Cantonese to Mandarin with a Taiwanese accent.\n\nThe food reflects this confusion. We ordered the beef noodle soup (an obsession of mine that I must try at every place that offers it), soup dumplings, pan-fried soup dumplings, fried chicken wings and 5-spice marinated beef.\n\nThe beef noodle soup was bizarre. The beef was tender and cut in the traditional Northern \"red roast\" style. The bok choy is also very Northern. But the noodles reminded me of the kind used in Cantonese dishes and the broth was nothing more than salty stock mixed with more salt and maybe a drop of soy sauce. Seriously, where was the rich beef flavor? Where were the traditional seasonings like garlic and chili peppers? It was obvious the beef had not been stewing in the broth for hours as it typically should be. This dish felt as confused as an in-bred dalmatian.\n\nThe XLBs were terrible. First off, the skins were way too thick. Guys, you don't make soup dumplings with such thick skins. You know why? Because the soup will inevitably get absorbed by all that flour leaving none for the filling. And that's exactly what happened. Half the soup dumplings had no soup. The other half had a pitiful amount. I've had some pretty mediocre xiao long baos over the years, but even the worst of those had a full dumpling of soup in them.\n\nThe pan-fried soup dumplings were exactly like the regular ones except slightly crispier. If soup was meant to be in them, it had certainly dissipated. The 5-spice marinated beef tasted like one spice and the cuts were really chewy, not soft and tender like they should be.\n\nI refuse to believe that these are the best xiao long baos in the city. That's just too sad a thought to accept. So I will continue to search for the city's best soup dumplings. I guess the only positive thing about this experience is that if you start really low, you have nowhere to go but up.", "author": "Josephine L."}

It looks similar to the green onion pancake but filled with delicious grinded up beef in the middle.  The beef pancake was very flavorful and has become a must order for us.\n\n*Shanghai Dumplings - MMMMM... The skin is not thick, but sturdy enough to pick up the dumpling without the broth spilling out.  I will admit, the meat is okay, but the dumplings are probably the best I've had in the city.  A vinegar soy sauce with ginger slices is provided to dip your dumplings in.\n\n*Pork & Shrimp Wonton - The won ton is delicious and flavorful and comes with wide rice noodles (hof fun), greens, and mushrooms.  The broth provides the perfect hangover cure (trust me, I speak from experience).\n\n*Pork Dumplings with Napa Cabbage - Yummy!  They're similar tasting to the Shanghai dumplings, but wrapped differently.  The pork/cabbage combo was delicious and the insides were juicy.\n\n*Beef Dumplings - Another must order!  Although it doesn't sound so appealing, the minute I bit into it, I loved it.  The dumpling is flavorful and juicy inside.\n\n*Pan Fried Shanghai Dumplings - It was okay, not what I was expecting.  I expected a dumpling similar to a potsticker but found it was more like a bun and it didn't contain the broth in the middle.\n\n*Pork Potstickers - It was fried very well but a tad on the greasy side.  I don't know what took so long, but it took about 20 minutes after ordering to get this.\n\nPRICING:\nCheap!  For our visit last weekend, the bill came out to $33 before tip for 3 people and 5 dishes.  \n\nSERVICE:\nThe manager/owner (I think?) guy is super nice and friendly.  On our first visit there, he came over and taught us how to pick up the dumpling with our chopsticks - apparently we're amateurs because we oooh-ed in learning something new.  \n\nCredit cards are accepted (not AMEX).", "author": "Nicole S."}

Wow.\n\nWe came here after the nice folks at Craftea gave us some dinner recommendations. I'm very glad we did this. Since there were only two of us, the wait wasn't that long. The place itself is tiny, but don't worry, you can also order for takeout. I think I'd rather do this in the future, because in this case I don't think there's much use to complaining about the space - the food is where it's at, and in my opinion, they did good with what they had. I can see why they've been doing this for 30 years.\n\nSince it's really small, the service is super efficient (i.e., yes, they will clean up after you quickly so they can serve more folks). We didn't really feel rushed, though. For $6-7 you can get a plate of 12 dumplings; I picked up the pan-fried soup dumplings, which I had never heard of before. I didn't really have any soup in mine, BUT the dumpling itself was so tasty and the texture was so wonderful that I didn't really care. It was like having a fried plain mochi with delicious meats inside. We got the lamb dumplings and those were filled with soupy goodness, and my goodness, they tasted fantastic. I was also in the middle of a craving for a rice dish so I picked up the eggplant over rice (nothing special, but it definitely sated my craving, so I withhold judgment on that since I ate it while biased with dizzying crave-taste-buds).\n\nThe dumplings were so good I wanted to buy three dozen and stick them in the freezer so I won't have to go out to the Sunset again to have me some tasty, cheap dumplings. They were so good that my boyfriend ate 13 dumplings. If I hadn't eaten a rice bowl, I'm sure I would have done the same. The texture of the wrapper itself was lovely, and I kept seeing people ordering those pancakes...which I have decided I must try. I must. I will.\n\nI have also decided that being the ruler of a kingdom of dumplings is totally not a bad thing. I plan on grabbing a bunch of these for takeout for the next game night. Or for myself.

Arriving at 9:20 pm, we were fortunate to grab the last table for four and were immediately told by the server that they were closing in 10 minutes. Keep in mind this place was packed at our time of arrival.\n\nFortunately our friends who had dined here many times and speak Mandarin started to rattle off dishes which we appreciated due to the time constraints of the restaurant closing.\n\nSpicy Deep Tendon (Appetizer):  Best described as a cold dish with the texture of tripe. Very good as an opening dish and the spice was just right.\n\nOrders of Pork Dumpling with Napa cabbage: green chives and celery:  Out of the three, the celery dumpling did not wow me but others in the party loved it.  My favorite was the pork with Napa cabbage and would order this and the chives again!\n\nBeef Pancake:  A definite winner in my book.  Better than a cha siu bow and similar to Peking Duck on a steamed bun. Hard to describe this but it was cut into 4 pieces for the four of us and had hoisin sauce and cilantro on the beef which was enclosed in a baked piece of bread (similar to a Panini but flattened down). I could have eaten all four pieces by myself - yum\n\nSpicy Green Beans: Like other yelpsters - the kitchen prepared this with just amount of spice, sauce and best of all \"crunch\" of the beans. This was another winner for all of us.\n\nKeep in mind, the other couple had previously had the above items many times before so it helped to be able to try their favorites.\n\nWith that being said, even though they were in a rush to clear the remaining tables and close, the server was very nice and later explained that on Monday thru Thursday they close at 9:30 with Friday and Saturday - closing at 10 pm.

First off, you'll notice how small the space is, there's about 8 small tables (made for 2-4) in this place and the kitchen is separated from the dining area by a small wall.  I'm sure on busier days it can get pretty steamy in there.\n\nWe were seated right away and were brought tea.  I already knew what I wanted to order, XIAO LONG BAO (soup dumplings).  But they definitely had an extensive menu.  In addition to the xiao long baos, we also ordered pork and chive dumplings, spicy beef tendon & beef pancakes.  I really wanted the sheng jian baos (soup dumplings, but FRIED), but was told those would take 30 minutes, I was really disappointed; those are even rarer to come by in the states than xiao long baos.\n\nAfter ordering, we were given small sauce bowls of vinegar & ginger (?).  And our food came out in about 5 minutes, the chive and pork dumplings took the longest to come out, about 10 minutes.  The beef tendons were tasty - thinly sliced tendon, and it wasn't too spicy at all.  The pork and chive dumplings were good as well, I enjoyed them.  The xiao long baos were definitely the stars of the meal, delicious, a must if you come!  The beef pancakes definitely filled me up, pan-fried and huge. My friend and I couldn't even finish it, but that was probably we stuffed ourselves full of dumplings first.  And the hot sauce is definitely spicy, so beware!\nTook me a while, but I finally made it to Kingdom of Dumplings, and I'm so glad that I did.  All of that for under $30, amazing.", "author": "Cindy L."}

I even double checked on the broth that it was vegetarian. Halfway through my vegetarian dumpling plate, I bit into sausage tasting pork of some sort. I gagged and spit it into my napkin. I immediately told our sever. She acted like it was no big deal. I told her I didn't want to even touch the rest of the dumplings on my order of my vegetarian dumplings out of fear that I would bite into another dead animal. She looked at them and said the rest of them looked vegetarian. Seriously? I asked for a glass of water. She took her time in returning. My friend pointed out, \"If I owned this restaurant and something like that happened, I would get that glass of water to the table as fast as possible.\" Instead she took her time and waited on another table. I had to ask for another glass of water from another server. I was shocked she still made me pay for the dumplings and that she didn't offer me a fresh plate or anything at all. In fact she never returned after she dropped off the glass of water. We uncomfortably sat and waited for our check for way too long. On another note: At the beginning of the meal, we ordered fried rice per our serves suggestion, but she brought us chow mein instead. I convinced my friend to just eat the chow mein and cancel the fried rice to make it easier on the cooking staff. I'm seriously disappointed with this restaurant. I'm disgusted I had pork in my mouth and I've felt sick all night. Yes, it all might be in my head, but maybe if the waitress was more apologetic and concerned about the mistake, I wouldn't have had to waste my time in writing this review.  Eating pork is a sin in many cultures and out of respect should be taken very seriously by all restaurants.", "author": "Christina N."}

Sure, the dumpling was steaming hot. Sure, the soup was simple, flavorful, and not oily. Sure, the meat and vegetables inside were smoothly grounded. \n\nBut the most important part of the dumplings, the skin, was just plain MEH. The skin is supposed to be very thin so that you can taste the meat and the soup inside the dumpling, and allow you to easily take a bite into the dumpling to get a bite full of skin-meat-veggies-soup. But the skin was very dough-y and a bit too thick, making it hard to chew the dumpling, and allowing me only to get an unsatisfactory bite of just plain skin.\n\nThe pork & Chinese spinach dumplings were actually better than the xiao long bao, maybe because the skin was less dough-y. The green chives pancakes were not worth it. They gave you a lot of onions, which was nice, but the outer skin was too crispy to the point it seemed like it was overcooked, and the whole thing was just dripping with oil.\n\nTotal bill came out to be a little over $20 which is very cheap, but I wouldn't come here for the xiao long bao only, which is what they're famous for.\n\nTip: \n- Very small restaurant, so come early! I went on a Saturday night at 6:15 and there was no line at all!\n- NO PARKING. Must find street parking! \n- They DO have take-outs, so maybe that could be another option to beat the long line.", "author": "Evelyn S."}

The wait on weekends are quite long per reviews and lines I've seen as a passerby. \n\nOur wait last Saturday was about 15 mins for a party of 3. The restaurant itself is tiny, literally \"hole in the wall\". Seats comfortably 20 people, but each table has a third chair which the occupancy can go up to maybe 30. Low ceilings and you'll smell like the kitchen once you leave. \n\nWe ordered the Shanghai dumplings and onion pancakes. The dumplings didn't take that long to come out but once they did, I was excited to try them. Ugh, first bite was a disappointment. The meat didn't taste fresh, the dough was doughy and flavor was flavorless. Good amount of soup in each dumpling though. Whole time I'm sitting there, I'm just thinking \"why does this place have high Zagat review?\" \"why do Yelpers give this 5 stars?\" I don't get it. After we chowed down our order of dumplings, we waited another 20 mins for the darn onion pancake. It felt like a lifetime. We asked the waiter a few times where it was and his response was it's coming, it's coming. I asked for the bill and he said it's coming. UGH! Well it finally came, and yum it's good. It tastes much like the Burmese Palatha but with onions.

The beef stew noodle soup was decent, although we thought the broth could have been hotter.  \n\nAnd now the main event...LET\"S GET READY FOR DUMPLINGS!!!!!  Let just say we were not disappointed one bit.  The xiao long bao was probably one of the best I've had in the whole Bay Area.  They were hot and juicy.  Some may think it's a little greasy, but who cares?  The two orders of boiled dumplings (pork/chive and pork/shrimp/chive) carried some well balanced flavors.  Some may think there's not enough meat in the dumplings, but to me the meat/chive ratio is proportionate.  We also had an order of sheng jian bao (pan fried).

It was really good food, but the ingredients in each item we got were very simple and to be honest, lacked a bit in flavor.\n\nTheir wings weren't exactly crispy, they were very tender and delicious, with a semi-sweet glaze. Typical \"Asian\" style wings though.\n\nThe Shanghai soup dumplings were pretty good. Very traditional taste and flavors. However not as soupy as I'm used to. In fact some of the ones I got were a bit dry.\n\nLast were the pork and chives dumplings. These were also pretty good, but again the taste wasn't outstandingly good.\n\n\nThe one thing that amazed me the most though, was the service and actually the dumpling wrappers. First the service.\n\nWe went on a Saturday night at around 8-8:30pm. We got there and there was a little bit of a wait, maybe 10 minutes so it went pretty quickly. We got seated, decided what to order, and it took us around 10 minutes to get our order in. Normally at any other restaurant I've been to, a long wait time between getting seated and getting our order in was due to a combination of the restaurant being busy, understaffed, or the waiters not up-to-par. However the only guy taking orders in the restaurant was very, very polite and courteous, and even though it took us a while to get our order, he kept reminding us that he was trying to get our order in, but had to take a phone order or seat some people. I thought that was a really nice gesture by him since it didn't make us feel neglected at all.\n\nSecondly, the dumpling wrappers. Normally dumpling wrappers I've gotten in restaurants have been the pre-made ones, where they're kind of dry, tough, and very thin. That was not the case here. These dumpling wrappers definitely looked, felt, and tasted homemade. They reminded me exactly of the dumpling wrappers I would make with my family, and that's really what made the experience here much more enjoyable.\n\ni would definitely recommend this place, and when I'm in town I'll definitely be coming back.", "author": "Andy C."}

I'm a fan of their restaurant but the size of the place makes it hard to snag a seat! \n\nI just picked up a bag of their pork and chive dumplings (juicy, amazing $6.49/bag) and chicken with Napa cabbage dumplings (clean flavor, good cabbage taste $6.99/bag). I also picked up a sleeper hit: the beef pancake (huge $3.49). I pan fry and steam dumplings according to others who have posted on the method. For the pancake, I put the hefty frozen disc on a hot, well oiled cast iron and let it go then flipped it when it started to puff at the edges. The result was a deliciously beefy, thick two layered pancake that was crispy brown on the outside and juicy inside. \n\nThe service here is very helpful, attentive and sweet. They can be out of something (no pork with shrimp and chive) or the ladies could be just making something when you roll in and give it to you freshly made on a plate, like our chicken cabbage dumplings.

Perhaps I've just been eating too much Chinese food lately but my friends agreed that we've all had better before.\n\nService was substandard: the regular Chinese experience where they'll silently take your order, bring you your food when ready, and you'll only get attention if you flag one of them down or walk to them yourselves. The food wasn't bad but wasn't great either: I didn't get a chance to try their Xaio Long Baos or Potstickers because they were out but their orange curry-looking hot sauce was surprisingly good. Overall, just your average Chinatown joint moved Sunset kinda deal. The overwhelming smell of vinegar was just too much for me to come back for seconds.", "author": "Albert L."}

This was a very unsuspecting visit for me.\n\nThe bf surprised me during one of my crazy work weekends with a small escape to SF to eat one of my favorite foods... dumplings! I absolutely love dumplings of all kinds, fillings, steamed, boiled, what have you. This place was perfect because it gave me just that ... dumplings of all sorts and especially XLBs. For those of you who don't know, an XLB (xiao long bao) is a sort of famous Shanghai-nese dish where a bun filled with meat is also filled with a cube of slightly frozen \"soup\" so when its steamed, the frozen \"soup\" becomes liquid and you end up with a little dumpling with soup in it. Delicious with a little ginger and some vinegar.\n\nTheir XLB... I'm not impressed.\n\nHowever! Their other dumplings (mainly steamed) were delightful. The skin was perfectly cooked and had the right kind of chewy texture without being hard or mushy. Their filling was just the right amount of seasoning, meat and veggies depending on which one you pick, and their other traditional Chinese dishes are fantastic. Being kind of a native and growing up in China for over 10 years, it really brought back childhood memories of my favorite dishes. This place is an A+.", "author": "Lorrie M."}

I tried the chicken & chive dumpling noodle soup, beef pancake, green onion pancake, cold wide mung bean noodle, and vegetarian dumplings. Overall, I thought that the food was cooked well, with the exception of one piece of my beef pancakes which seemed to be falling apart and inexplicably wet (the rest of the pieces were fine though). The pancakes had a good texture, the dumplings came out hot and the wrapper had a nice soft texture.\n\nMy main complaint with the food is that across the board, it was pretty under seasoned. I think a little more saltiness could've gone a long way in making it a better experience.\n\nGood thing they provide some sauce to liven things up a bit. The tableside house hot sauce is really good.

My meal at Kingdom of Dumpling was one of the best I've had all year, and it's been an especially good year for eating on a personal level.\n\nThe dining room itself appears to be a poorly converted living room space, decked out with terrible lighting, a few drab pictures and signs written in completely indecipherable English. Similarly, the menu was translated by someone who I could only guess has a tenuous grasp of the English language. It's riddled with mistakes and it's an absolute wonder this place operates as a business, seeing as how you have to dodge waiters and cooks alike through the kitchen just to get to the bathroom (unisex, one toilet).  This isn't some million dollar fine dining establishment - it's the cozy mom and pop joint that those million dollar restaurants can never seem to top in the actual taste department. \n\nIn truth, you will be sweating when you walk in here, as a thick blanket of heat wafts right into the dining space, straight from the kitchen mere steps away. But none of the tiny, nagging little things about this place will matter once you have the food. All you need to do is order dumplings. It doesn't matter what kind because they are all monumentally good. The lamb, the beef, the soup dumplings. Order all of them. Have you ever eaten something and just known that what you were eating was the very best representation of that type of food there was? Yeah, this place has a lock on dumplings. \n\nIt may have a ton of reviews on this website, and it commands a consistent wait time on most nights, but I still believe this is one of the better secrets for food lovers in SF. The meal was one of the most memorable of the year and I couldn't be happier I had the opportunity to try this place.", "author": "Eric F."}

Yet, even though the waitress and a few other people walked by our table countless times, it didn't dawn on them that we still did not have a menu.  If my friend had not asked for them, I don't know if they would have come at all.  When we were ready to order, we also waited and finally told someone we were ready to order.   By then lot's of people were waiting, and I thought they would have been interested in turning the table as quick as possible.  \n\nThe food was good, as usual, with the lamb dumplings being the best.  The string beans were really good too, but they are better at The Shanghai Dumpling King.  The entire time we were there, the young waitress had quite the sour look on her face, with everyone.  I really don't know what her problem is, but she should realize that this is a business.  Also, my friend had to use the bathroom, which several people left with looks of surprise.  She said she one has to walk extremely close to kitchen fires to get there, the warmth she could feel through the wall in the bathroom!  \n\nI was so happy the first time I went there, as you can see in the previous review, that this time I was completely surprised to have the opposite experience.

However, the reason I give it only 3 stars is because:\n1. The location is awful; the restaurant itself is tiny and hard to find.\n2. You have little to no arm space at your own table; this is exacerbated by the fact that every single table is within 2 feet of one another.\n3. The place gets busy, so the servers are snappy and impatient.\n\nThe place's only saving grace was its dumplings. You have to try them! I went with my family and we got 3 platters of dim sum. Absolutely delicious! But again, be mindful of the cramped space. If you're claustrophobic or just iffy about personal space at all, I would say that this place probably is not the best for you.", "author": "Justin H."}

Their cookies, croissants and brownies are amazing! Life's too short, have dessert first!\n\nAlso, make sure you use the restroom elsewhere before you come here, because like the Kingdom of Dumpling seating area, the kitchen is miniscule and you'd have to go through it to the teeny tiny bathroom.\n\nWe had the Soup Dumplings, which were great, the pork and green bean dumplings which had a nice gingery taste to them and soft outsides, and were our favorites for the evening, garlic green beans (these came out first and were perfectly cooked and seasoned, not to spicy but with a bit of a kick), onion cakes (super flavorful with not too much egg filling--a nice crisp yet chewy texture), and spring rolls, which I would skip next time I go. The spring rolls weren't bad, per se, but with so many other excellent dishes I could do without them (they were sort of mushy and mushroomy inside, and pretty flavorless). The total with two beers came to around $40, which isn't bad for the amount of food you get. It's nice they take credit cards, I wasn't sure they would since it's such a small restaurant.\n\n\nOur food came out sort of sporadically, kind of like at San Tung, which was okay. The place is so small that it's easy to flag down a waiter or waitress for extra items (yes, I wanted a fork, oh the shame). They said they were out of certain items, like pan-fried soup dumplings and chive pancakes, but I suspected they were just not cooking them that evening because it was so busy--how would you run out of pan-fried soup dumplings and have regular ones?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-01-05", "description": "Surprisingly NOT over-hyped dumpling place. \n\nFirst, some comparison about dumplings. I'm Taiwanese, and in Taiwan, dumpling skins are A LOT THINNER. And more monotonic, generally we just put minced pork and green onions in it; sometimes there's chives flavor which I hate. \n\nI usually dislike mainland Chinese-style dumplings. I don't like their thicker and chewier dumpling skin, it just feel....less refined. This place did change my perspective on thicker dumpling skins. They somehow make it work. Perhaps it's because while being thicker, the consistency is still good, and they fill it up with a lot of fillings so you don't feel like you're just eating the skin.\n\n\nWhat I get here:\n\nDumplings (of course) --- They have 10+ flavors. My favorite is the lamb dumpling which is rare to come by. I've only seen lamb dumplings when I was in Beijing and these are quite comparable.\n \nXiao Lung Bao (soup dumplings) --- These XLB are also slightly more thick-skinned. Compared to Ding Tai Fung's (Taiwan's most internationally famous XLB), their XLB I must say is equally good if you can accept thicker skin. \n\nSalt & pepper tofu --- Lightly-fried tofu cubes with little salt and pepper sprinkled. A rather light (and if you must, bland) dish. But I sometimes like the refreshing contrast against all the heavyweight dumplings.\n\nMarinated enoki mushrooms --- Rather unusual cold appetizer. The enoki mushrooms are marinated in a cold vinegar-ish sauce. I like it.\n\nBaked sweet cake \u87f9\u58f3\u9ec4\uff08\u751c\uff09 --- One of my favorite dessert dishes. It's a baked pastry shell with usually some kind of sugary filling (sometimes melted sugar, sometimes sesame). When it comes fresh out of their oven ...OOOOOH SO GOOD.\n\n\n\n\nAlso important note:  DIP THE DUMPLINGS and XLB in the sauce they give you! It's vinegar + soy sauce + ginger. It will make the already delicious dumpling 100% better!", "author": "Elizabeth T."}

Definitely the best fried rice I've had.\n--Beef Chow Fun - Pretty OK, average noodle dish.

I spent almost an hour on the Muni traveling to Kingdom of Dumpling, and I will advise others on XLB pilgrimages against wasting so much of their time: these soup dumplings are not worth the investment.\n\nThe restaurant itself is small, and there is a wait for tables during peak meal times. There is a sign-up sheet outside the door.\n\nThe XLBs (Shanghai soup dumplings on the menu) here have strangely sticky skins that were thicker than expected but paradoxically extra flimsy.  There were many breakages, and the dumplings were not filled with as much soup as I expected. The meat was also not very flavorful and had an over-processed, slightly chalky texture.\n\nThe shen jian bao were pretty good, but they are erroneously called \"Shanghai pan-fried soup dumplings\" on the menu-- these are not pan-fried XLB; there is no soup in these dumplings! They are more accurately small meat-filled buns that are pan-fried and steamed concurrently.  The \"skin\" is actually leavened dough instead of unleavened dumpling skin. These took about 20 min to come out because they are made fresh to order.\n\nGarlic string beans were crisp, garlicky, and quite oily. I like my string beans a little softer, but for fans of crisp string beans, these would probably be quite delectable.\n\nI had high hopes for Kingdom of Dumpling based on its hype, and I felt let down.

Placed our name, number of people on a paper list, hanging by the doorway.  Wasn't too long, we got a table.\n\nUnder dim sum, item 2 the Shanghai pan fry soup dumplings (4) USD 4.95 wasn't available - a disappointment, so we settled on item 1 the Shanghai soup dumplings (6) USD 4.95, which was really good, but it was the pan fried, which I have had in Shanghai at Yang's Fried Dumpling which I considered to be the gold standard to measure other dumplings which none have come across to be as good.  Item 5 onion pancakes (1) USD 3.95, cut into eight pieces stacked, was hot, oily, crispy, quite tasty, I liked it.\n\nUnder latest new dishes, item 3 the grilled skewered lamb (4) USD 6.95, a slow low mild spiciness that builds, was very tasty; item 18 garlic black fungus with cucumbers with vinegar and garlic USD 5.95, was a cold, slightly crunchy, quite tasty and different.  Q style jelly fish is one of their latest items not on their printed menu, but is posted on the wall.  Also under this catagory are:  green chives dumpling with egg, farmer's cucumber, boiled peanut with celery.\n\nUnder Wok dishes, item 4 garlic string beans USD 6.95 was excellent, cooked, but still crispy, flavored with soy sauce, oil, garlic.  Under drinks, item 2 Thai tea USD 1.75 was iced, sweentened with milk, tasty, not too sweet as I have tasted at other places.\n\nWe ordered one dish too many or didn't really need.  This was before adding the onion pancakes afterward, asked if this was enough food, our waitress said not, so we added under soup noodle, item 1 pork & shrimp wonton with wide rice noodle USD 5.95, which came after every other dish ordered was okay, I thought the wonton skin was rather thick, the soup base passable, but Yin Du Wonton Noodle on Pacific Ave at Beckett St would be superior with thin wonton skin, amazing soup base.\n\nRecommend calling to see if they have Shanghai pan fried soup dumplings before making the trek to the restaurant.

Parking was plentiful when I visited. \n\nKingdom of Dumpling has many local accolades, all focused around their soup dumplings. Hands down, they were excellent. Additionally, they were reasonably priced as well! However, service was poor (no refills during our visit), the decor was lackluster, and when we were ready to pay and leave, the entire staff was sitting and eating at a table. I guess that was their way of suggesting that future service or orders were off the table. \n\nBesides the soup dumplings, none of the other items were that good or memorable. \n\nKingdom of Dumpling Haiku: \nYummy soup dumpling\nRest of menu not worth it\nOnly 6 per plate", "author": "Bryan C."}

However, there's always a line out the door, so my curiosity got the better of me. They also seem to have cleaned up the place and have doubled their inspection score to 84 according to the link.\n\nI walked in at 5p on a Sunday, and there were still many empty tables. As we ordered and waited for our food, all the tables filled up and a crowd of people began to wait outside. It takes a while for the food to arrive since they steam everything, and, like its predecessor David's Kitchen, the place gets very hot while you're waiting. The male server seemed preoccupied with his iphone and barely looked around the dining room. \n\nI ordered the xiao long bao and the pork/corn dumplings with qq noodles. I didn't know what qq noodles were, but this was the only menu item that combined dumplings with noodles. Qq noodles ended up being the glass/cellophane noodles (reading the menu again after I ordered, I found out that I could've substituted the qq noodles with another noodle of my choice). The dumplings were much tastier than the xiao long bao; the xlb's soup was good but its skin was too thick for my liking. I heard a couple ask the server in Chinese if they could split a dumpling order (boiled, 12 dumplings per flavor) between two flavors of dumplings (so 6 each), and I think she said yes. I'm not sure if they normally allow that, but half orders would be good for smaller parties.", "author": "Diana B."}

Dumplings were good. Another good thing was that the food started coming out immediately after we ordered. I had a really strange vibe from the guy (manager?Waiter?) who helped us. *I didn't deduct points for this, 4 points is based on food and other staff who got us food very quickly*  His rudeness was extremely sugar coated and sly and left me confused. He gave us menus as we were waiting then tried to take our order from outside of the door instead of letting us take a seat first. And when I suggested that we would like to step in and take a seat before ordering, he gave a very obvious expressions of discontent mixed with frustration. He followed us to our table, sat down and listened to our order--7 items for 3 people. After we were done ordering, he tried to get us to order extra things. First suggestion was chicken wings \"for the ladies\", then cucumber salad and when we said no to the cucumber salad he suggested it once again. He totally blew us off when one in our party asked for a glass of water. I don't remember exactly what he said but his entire demeanor was off putting and he never brought the water for the person who asked for it. The great thing was that food started coming out immediately after we ordered, and the rest of the staff was very nice and helpful.

It's a small restaurant with no more than 8 tables, clean with white table cloths and good service.  However, the food was nothing special and I won't find myself coming back here.\n\nWe ordered:\n\nClassic steamed dumplings- Not impressed, the skin was too thick which took away from the flavors of the pork meat. The soup wasn't as flavorful as I would've liked. It comes with 6 dumplings for about $6. Try out Shanghai Dumpling King, their XLB are much tastier.\n\nPork and chive dumplings- I was worried the chive flavors would be overwhelming but luckily it was a subtle taste of chives and the pork was soft but once again, bland and nothing special. On the plus side, everything is made fresh and in house. The dumplings come in 12 pieces.\n\nPot stickers- Nice and crispy pot stickers, but the meat filling tasted exactly the same as the XLB.  Not flavorful or special however, I liked this dish the best out of the others because of the texture of the skin.", "author": "Victoria N."}

Talk about a hole in the wall.\n\nCame here with one of my high school friends after hearing about this place for a while, and we both agreed ahead of time that we were going to have to put these dumplings to the test.  After perusing their somewhat extensive (relative to the size of the kitchen) but mostly dumpling comprised menu, we decided to go with:\n\n- Chicken and Corn Dumpling - a favorite among my friend's family, I thought it was pretty good.  The filing wasn't as moist as I would have liked, but I liked the combination of chicken and corn.  I would definitely get this one again.\n\n- Xiao Long Bao - my favorite and the star of the meal to me.  Just the right amount of delicious soup and meat on the inside, and perfect skin on the outside.  It was thick enough so that it wouldn't break apart when lifting it with chopsticks, yet still very soft and thin.  The only negative?  The tray came with just six of them!  \n\n- Cold noodles, cilantro, and dressing (I can't remember the name of the dish) - pretty good, and fortunately just a trace of cilantro flavor (yes, once again...I HATE cilantro).  Noodles were pretty al dente so they had some bite to it, and I liked the dressing.\n\nAs for service, it's a Chinese restaurant, so it's never going to be outstanding.  Even still, I thought it was pretty aggressive.  When my friend and I ordered, the waiter suggested we get a fourth dish, and went as far as to try to order the Chinese pancake for us.  Throw on the fact that the guy dropped the bill on our table when we were only halfway through our meal, and how the young waitress repeatedly ignored my friend whenever she tried to flag her down until it was time for us to leave, and it definitely put a damper on how good their food is.  In fact, it's the only thing that's held me back from five stars.\n\nGreat food and the best XLB I've had in SF, but expect to get rushed out so they can turn your table over.

As a recent summer transplant to SF, I've been searching the city for the elusive perfect soup dumpling (which I've been craving like crazy since they don't have them back in Chi-town) and YELP took me to this place.  Starving after hiking in Muir Woods, my BF and I arrived around 5 on a Sunday,  and there was already a wait - 4 people sitting in chairs so I figure it will be good.  We write our name on the clipboard,  I take a peek inside and start laughing - it's literally like you are in someone's living room.  I ask the waitress while waiting outside whether I can see a menu and she just waves her hand at me (huh?! I'm one of your own people!) but the menu is posted on their window.  We wander around for 30 minutes, contemplate going to a different dumpling place down the street, but finally get in.  \n\nI've often found the quality of the food at Chinese places is directly correlated with the engrish-ness of the menu: the more grammatically incorrect, the tastier.  At this point I was expecting a few Michelin stars.\n\nFrom best to worst:\n\nGreen Beans: Fried in really hot oil with delish garlic and soy sauce.  Not hard to make at home but they do a pretty good job with the sauce.  I keep telling myself its a vegetable, even though it tastes like crack (someone mentioned this)\n\nBoiled dumplings with shrimp and pork: Dipped them in the green bean sauce since the vinegar soy sauce with garlic they brought out was too vinegary.  Some bites you can def taste the shrimp, others you can't, but they were a big plateful (12) for $6.\n\nCold sliced beef: Not sure what this is called, but it was a decent appetizer. Drizzled with sesame oil and on a bed of wilted spring mix, it was too late before I realized that the lettuce probably wasn't meant to be eaten.\n\nSoup dumplings: UGH. So disappointed - this is what I came here for and they were so anti-climactic.

Probably 7 small tables total, roughly. Has the hole-in-wall look going for it, and the seemingly home-cooked taste to back it up. I can imagine this place fills up during peak hours, but visited around linner/dinch time.\n\nFairly priced. Was $6.50 for 12 dumplings. Perfect snack in between meals.

You'll lure me in with sweet promises of soupy dumplingy goodness, only to scorch the inside of my mouth with your molten broth. Well, not this time! I'll set you aside for a moment and try the shrimp, pork and chive dumplings first.\n\nWell, the plan backfired. You know a mouthful of food is too hot when you try to douse the heat with hot tea. A day later, the roof of my mouth is still sore. And you know what? I have no regrets. Both types of dumpling were good, but the shrimp-and-pork were particularly worth a bit of mouth-scorching.\n\nThese are boiled dumplings rather than the steamed ones I'm more used to. The shrimp was not overcooked and rubbery, as it can be at cheap dim sum places. They went well with the vinegary dipping sauces, augmented with the strange orange stuff that was on the table instead of the more common chili oil.\n\nThe soup dumplings, as always, were fun to eat. If you aren't familiar with the procedure, I believe you're supposed to use your chopsticks to lift them into your spoon, suck out some broth, dip, and slurp the whole thing out of the spoon like an oyster from a half-shell. (Why not just serve the broth on the side, you ask? Stop asking so many questions. Eat your dumplings.) These were a little light on the broth, but still enjoyable.\n\nA note on getting a table: there's a little clipboard outside where you can put your name on the waiting list.

I don't expect great service from a Chinese restaurant, but this is ridiculous. \n\nAsked for refill on tea. Waiter takes it away and we don't see our teapot for 10 minutes. I inquire about it and they bring it back. Well, this happened twice. Same exact thing. I did not ask for the teapot to be taken away. I asked them for more tea. There was no miscommunication.\n\nSomeone on my table asks for water. 20 minutes later. Nothing. Gotta ask again. It takes 10 more minutes. So it takes 30 minutes to get water?\n\nWe are constantly running out of the vinegar. We ask for refill. Same poor service. It takes like 10-15 minutes before it comes out. Now that stinks because we need the vinegar for our food and we have nothing to dip the xiao long bao or dumplings in.\n\nThe wait staff is incompetent. They don't apologize either for being so delayed in everything.\n\nWe ordered the lamb dumpling. We never got it after 40 minutes so we ask what's going on. They said they sold out. Well, why didn't you tell us earlier so we don't expect it? Do we really need to be the ones who inquire?\n\nOne of our orders never came out so after 50 minutes we cancel it. We waited a long time for it and that just is no good. Another bun type dish came out but it was all burnt on the bottom and I mean black. The waiter said that's just how it is. I'm like \"What?\" He should have taken it back and apologized but instead he wanted us to eat it and pay for it. \n\nWe also had a red bean friend pancake. It took forever to come out. I would say 1 hour and that's after asking multiple times where it is.\n\nThe wait staff seemed like they wanted to just leave and get out of the restaurant so they can seat other customers. I tried ordering potstickers and another dish and was told it takes 40 minutes. I said that's fine. She proceeded to just cross that dish off and wouldn't place the order. That's wrong. So what it takes 40 minutes?! It's on the menu. There's nothing on the menu that says I can't order it.\n\nNear the end of the meal the owner shows up and tries to make amends because we told them about all these problems. I appreciate that. He's a nice guy, but his wait staff is horrible. I really don't like their attitude.\n\nThe total bill was $84, but we didn't know how they got there. There was no line item with price. We didn't know if we were charged for the items that were sent back to the kitchen or the items they ran out of. They let us calculate it ourselves. This really should be the job of the wait staff. \n\nA horrible, terrible, experience as it was someone's birthday. I am embarrassed to recommend this place.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-07-21", "description": "Kingdom of Dumpling was hyped up to me as legit good Chinese food.  It was good but not amazing.  I can be harsh with my dumpling reviews, but it's only because I love them.\n\nEverything at Kingdom of Dumpling is hand made and feels very homecooked.  This is what works for and against Kingdom of Dumpling at the same time.  The dough used for the wrap is thick, unlike the premade wraps you can buy at the market, an obvious sign of being hand made.  The soup and pork used for the fillings have the flavors you expect from restaurant quality food while still retaining that grandma made feel.\n\nDespite these excellent qualities the food just isn't up there with the best.  I'll compare the xiao long bao against Ding Tai Fung, the best and non-existant in the Bay Area.  The thick hand made wrap doesn't really work for the xiao long bao.  It's not as thick as the regular pork dumpling but it's too thick for my liking.  The soup base is good but not great, good pork flavor, soup is not greasy and struck me as having no MSG, it just didn't wow me.  The pork was solid but not amazing.  There isn't that much soup and the ratio of ingredients skew too much to the wrap.  3/5\n\nThe Sheng Jian Bao (pan fried dumplings) are bad.  Yes they are hand made and we were warned it would take 30 minutes to make.  It did indeed take 30 minutes to make and was not worth the wait at all.  The bread is too doughy, not enough of it is pan fried.  There is not enough soup.  The pork is ok but strikes me as having almost a minced texture which is bad.  The bottom is barely pan fried.  Shanghai style food is known for being greasy and some baos have a hint of sugar in their soup mix.  This is not that greasy and no hint of sugar.  I would eat this again but I wouldn't pay for it.  It doesn't taste bad but it's not a real Shanghai Sheng Jian Bao. 2/5\n\nThe Pork Dumping is the best dish I tried.  This is a typical dumpling that your mom or grandma would make.  The thick hand made wrap works perfectly for this dumpling since it is not fried.  The pork and soup mix taste home made and works for this dish.  Clean and distinct flavors here and a seeming lack of MSG make me give it two thumbs up.  This is not my favorite type of dumpling but it is 100% like the kind your grandma made or the kind you wish your grandma made.  The only down side is that the pork and soup are not up there with the very best of the best, but that's being too picky.   4/5\n\nSesame Pancake with Marinated Beef was a surprise.  I enjoyed this.  The sesame pankcake was crisp.  It seemed like a small sandwich.  Beef was ok.  I'd order it again but since it's not a dumpling I'll end it at that.\n\nThe waiter warned us that you may not order a second time so you'll need to make sure you get your entire order in the first time.  I assume this is because the place is very small and there is often a line here.  This is not a place to enjoy a casual meal.", "author": "Vincent V."}

Parked, wrote our name on the list and waited less than 15 minutes for the two parties of two ahead of us to get seated (didn't take too long as I know the wait here can be long).  \n\nIt was basically just my sister and me eating lunch, and we ordered beef chow mein, 1 order of soup dumpling, 1 order of pork napa cabbage dumpling & onion pancake.  I initially ordered chive pancake but the persistant waiter said, \"You order onion, since you Americanized.\" I looked at him puzzled and told him, \"But I like chive...\" and he replied back muttering what I thought was him saying he'd do a half and half order. When the pancake arrived at the table, it was onion, no chive.  I brushed it off cause it tasted good.  Not what I expected but it was good.\n\nI've eatten here once before a few years ago, and I remember the soup dumplings. Which was my favorite of the lot.  My sister and I finished the chow mein and seen the table next to us with chow fun.  The sister wanted more carbs so I put in an order for beef chow fun.  My niece decided she was hungry and ate the remainder of the pork and cabbage dumplings.  I then asked our waiter who was in passing if we can put in another order of the soup dumplings.  He made a rude comment and said, \"Give me a minute. You can not keep putting in orders.\"  AGAIN putting a puzzled look on my face.  I looked around and it wasn't even that busy.  At that point I was put off.  There was another waiter who was on staff as well.  When he passed us up, I asked for the check.  The chow fun took a while to come out. As soon as it came, we asked for a to go box and paid our bill. IDK if I'd come back.  I would give em a 1 star - \"Eek! Methinks not\" but the soup dumplings are delectable.  Can't deny good food, so they get a 2 star - \"Meh. I've experienced better\".", "author": "Olga F."}

Go for the standards and you can't go wrong (ie pork, shrimp, or chicken with chives or onions).\n\nThe soup dumplings were burning hot. They were tasty and almost good as the famous New York's \"Joe's...\" Also, the lamb does have a game-y taste and an even more potent smell. It is also heavier of a meat ...So do not save that to try last. \n\nThe onion pancake was also good and crisp. They were a bit flour-Y though. Still good and one of us loved it. Also, to get the yelp deal for free pancakes, you have to order a ton to reach $35 which is not a problem for a large group.\n\nEnjoy!", "author": "E K."}

Also, come on a Friday or Weekend evening and expect to be waiting at least 30mins for a table. Make sure you give your order clearly to the person taking your order or you may end up with something you didn't order. They literally make the dumplings right up the block! Place is extremely small and you have to walk through the kitchen to use the restrooms. Don't forget to use the orange colored hot sauce to dip your dumplings in. Can't vouch for the other items on their menu; when you know what's good and fresh and works, why change it? 4 stars because the place isn't the cleanest - hot sauce jar is always crusted over and don't look under the lid unless you want an unappetizing surprise, kitchen area is a little bleh as well but oh well the food is awesome and have never gotten sick from eating here. Wait staff is polite and do a great job of juggling between taking phone orders and waiting tables. It is definitely worth the wait should you find the line out the door. Live close by and find the line too long for your liking? Then order for pickup...usual wait times for me average about 20mins. Be sure to rush home to enjoy the dumplings while they are still freshly cooked.  It'll be your favorite dumpling spot I'm sure!", "author": "Roger E."}

The dumplings were, quite simply, amazing. It was worth waiting 20 minutes in the rain for a table.\n\nFirst impression: KoD appears to be a converted Parkside home, with the dining area being smaller than the average livingroom. After hovering under the awning with two other couples seeking shelter from the rain, my eyes lit up as a table opened up and we were seated near the window.\n\nThe place was bustling with families and couples seated cozily near each other in close quarters. The two servers darted in and out of the kitchen in hurried fashion. After flagging one down, we ordered:\n\n- Xiao long bao (soup dumplings): It would be a crime not to order their famous XLB dumplings. After all, they were featured in SF's 7x7. Delicate and bursting with flavor, we poked a hole in each dumpling to let the steam out, then carefully spooned a bit of KoD's spicy orange sauce and soy sauce into each. Be careful - the soup is hot and bursts out when you bite into it. You might want to eat these from your spoon rather than from your chopsticks. (photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r19XhpINtQxhMwB0eKnmjA?select=yb1Ebv6jVkoilxESYH3qTA)\n\n- Pork with napa cabbage dumplings: To my surprise, I loved these even more than the XLBs. So much flavor! I even took two dozen frozen dumplings home with me. Just knowing I have them in my freezer right now makes me giddy with excitement - hee! \n\n- Shrimp dumplings: They were out of the pork & shrimp dumplings, so I settled for these. Good, but not as flavorful as the XLB and pork w/ napa cabbage dumplings. I think pork is the key differentiator here.\n\nService was a bit scattered, but it was very busy and they were as attentive as one could reasonably expect. I'm not sure how much the frozen pork and napa cabbage dumplings were, but based on my $35 bill, I think they're only like $4 or $5 a dozen. Could this get any better?\n\nIMO, a restaurant deserves five stars when I miss their food long after my visit is over. Those pork dumplings in my freezer don't stand a chance - they're being devoured today. And after that, I'll be in \"dumpling withdrawal\" until my next visit to KoD.", "author": "Mariela D."}

Using the word \"Kingdom\" in the name is deceiving.

Hidden far away in Park Side, without the sign and the line of people waiting in the from, it could easily been mistaken for some sort of elevated basement. Despite being tightly packed into the square room, the patrons waited patiently to be served, as the late afternoon shined through the front windows.\n\nI was most excited to have found spicy beef tendon on the menu, even more when it appeared before my eyes. Beef tendons cooked in soy sauce, rock sugar and anise seed, chilled then thinly sliced. It is then mixed with chili oil, garlic, pepper, chopped cilantro and sesame oil.\n\nThe tendons see-through when picked up. It was cold and refreshing at first, the texture gelatinous but on the chewy side. Chopped up cilantro brought a nice aroma that erased any unwanted fattiness. Then - as we sat and ate, before we knew it, the stealthy numbing spice hit us. Like wild fire it spread through our mouth, making us sweat yet unable to stop going for more.\n\nAs for the dumplings, you could really taste the hand-knead dough. Thicker than the store-bought, machine-made ones, the dumpling skin was thicker and a chewier, the perfect kind that holds the stuffing together. Inside, ground pork and cabbage made a great pair - juicy, sweet, with a nice crunch from the green veggie. A light dip in black vinegar and some ginger slices gave a rounded taste.\n\nNext up, the tiao long bao. These dumplings were steamed instead of boiled. Enveloped within is a pork filling, prepared with solid pork aspics that melted into the tasty broth when heated. Because of the hot soup that could burst at the bite, it was recommended that we open up the dumplings a bit to let it cool before eating.\n\nUmami was its profile. The broth was on the greasier side, but tasty nonetheless. It provided a whole different experience next to the spicy tendon and the boiled dumplings - which were felt like a hugely satisfying, working man's meal. The soup dumpling, despite its thicker skin, felt delicate and gentle. To my tummy that was happy, that went for a long sigh and said: What. A. Day.", "author": "Fiona S."}

So all those trying this place for the first time, please, do not set your standards too high. Because by the time you reach the bathroom in this place, you want to get out. I would rather have a port-a-pottie outside rather than the awkwardness of going to the bathroom here. They have a clean bathroom, but to get there you must go through the kitchen, dodge flying elbows from chefs, fit yourself in about 10 inches of space, avoid getting splashed by frying pan oils. Trust me, this is part of the whole experience of dining here. \nOr you can just not use the bathroom.\n\nThe menu is very straightforward. It's divided into 2 sections, the way I saw it. New stuff.... or .... Old stuff. But from the looks of the menu, the paper was written decades ago. So it's old stuff... or... old stuff. They have some Mandarin styled dishes, then they have a lot of fried stuff, then they have the dumplings. Chicken, beef, or shrimp with either corn, spinach, chinese spinach, chives, or a couple other choices. Everything is hand made, of course, and that's why it is amazing! One serving is enough to fill one person, provided they eat with rice. The Sesame donut looks good for desert, also, so try that too!\n\nSpace is tiny, decor is nonexistent, and ventilation is sufficating. I came around 5pm on a weekend, not busy at all, but with only 8 or 9 tables, I can see that it will get extremely busy real fast.

Dumplings are pretty small - half the size of what dumplings typically should be). Seems like they pulled a Dunkin donuts and reduced their size by 50%. The dough was pretty gummy. New yawkers/northeasterners should know what I'm talking about). Shanghai soup dumpling were dry and have no soup in them and the skin was too thick. Beef noodle soup was bland, noodles are thin and skimpy in quantity, and there was barely any meat and the meat that was served was too fatty and sub quality. Beef pancakes were plain and oily. The prices, tho not pricey, is not exactly cheap either for the low quantity and quality that's served. The establishment is fairly small and decor is lackluster, you can say even run down and not very clean and could use a renovation. The service was typical service of non-smiling, non-talkative waiters that you'd see in the typical immigrant Chinese restaurant.

I've just been twice in the last 2 days so I figured it was time to write a review for this place. \n\nFor two, we ordered the pork and napa cabbage dumplings, shanghai dumplings, green beans, cong you bing, and \n\nFor four, we had an additional 2 orders of dumplings, additional order of shanghai dumplings, additional green beans, bok choy, and wings and were very full. \n\nThe BEST thing (something i'd actually crave and would go out of my way to get) are the green (string?) beans, which are passed through oil and seasoned with soy sauce and garlic, and are very tender. The bok choy is also quite good. \n\nOf the dumplings, the Pork and Napa cabbage are my favorite, though the shrimp/pork/chive ones are good as well. I haven't tried the chicken but I've heard they aren't great. The xiao long bao are decent but I prefer Shanghai Dumpling King. \n\nThe wings were disappointing - they are 'fried' but not crispy since they were drowning in a rather sweet sauce :/ The cong you bing were also a bit of a letdown. Not quite crispy enough, and not much flavor either. They could have used more green onion as well as some salt. \n\nOverall I always leave this place very satisfied though, and would come back again and again for the green beans and the dumplings for a guaranteed satisfactory meal.", "author": "Kathleen L."}

Their dough was a little thick and chewy, not my preference. Plus there wasn't that many :( my boyfriend order two orders and it came in one plater and the whole time I thought it was one order waiting for the second one to come. When our chicken wings arrived, I asked my boyfriend and he said it was two :( and I was a little surprised that their crispy chicken wings weren't actually like fried chicken  wings.. They were slathered in sauce which wasn't what I expected . Though I did like their Chile paste! Which was probably the only thing I did like.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-01-29", "description": "Kingdom of Dumpling is supposedly one of the Top 100 Chinese Restaurants in the country. That's a pretty big claim to live up to. Maybe my expectations were too high. (btw, I do not rate Chinese restaurants based on service...in my experience, the ruder the service and the dirtier the restaurant, the better the food -- this only applies for Chinese restaurants).\n\nMy friend and I got here at 12:20pm Sat, right before the rush. It's a very very small restaurant, with maybe seating for like 20-30 people. Very small. That's why there's always a wait (but I saw the owner giving little kids yummy Japanese fruit gummy candy while they waited...that was cute!). Don't forget to feed the parking meter like we did and end up with a hefty ticket!\n\nBecause of its popularity and crowds waiting, you gotta decide on everything you want in the beginning; you can't order more later. They try to get you in and out of there as fast as possible (i.e. they put the bill on the table while you're halfway done eating).\n\nI felt like we were pressured to order more (\"that's not enough for two people! I recommend getting _____ or _____\")...I wonder if it's because they want to reach a certain minimum order per table for it to be worth your sitting there instead of someone waiting outside who would be willing to spend more money. ;)\n\nAnyways, here's a review of what we got:\n1. Xiao Long Bao: this is what they're famous for. Very juicy and tender, not quite up to par with what I've had in Shanghai, but still good.\n\n2. \"Dumping\" soup with QQ noodle (lol Engrish): I did not expect QQ noodle to be the thin vermicelli glass noodle! QQ noodle to me meant thick chewy noodles. Definitely not it. The dumplings were good though...we chose pork & chives dumplings. Apparently you can buy these frozen dumplings at their other store at half the price. Hmm...sounds like a good idea!\n\n3. Green onion pancakes: They were okay, pretty thin, but they had absolutely NO SALT in them at all. You gotta put SOME salt in these things, typically. I usually don't like things salty, but this literally had no salt. I usually make better green onion pancakes than this (and the frozen store-bought ones are better). But I still ate more than my share of them. :P\n\n4. XO Beef Chow Fun: It was okay, but didn't have that fried taste that I love in good chow fun. Like when the wok goes on fire. Mmmm. But this was not it. The beef was really tender though!\n\nSo as you can see...I keep saying \"it was okay, BUT...\". I started out giving this place a 4 star (thinking it was a 3.5, rounding up), but after I wrote a few paragraphs, I felt like it really was only a 3 for me today. I think it may have just been my expectations were too high.\n\nPrices are reasonable though.", "author": "Esther Y."}

That's over $1 per dumpling!!!) and I didn't think that they were that good. The wrappers were thin, and they had soup, but the filling was very blah texture wise, and the soup was not at all savory.

I ilked the fact that they put stalks of perfectly cooked bok choy in there. But the noodles were anything but QQ, as they were obviously not homemade and they were very limp and overcooked. There were a large number wontons, but the wrappers were thick, and the filling didn't have enough napa cabbage to give it the right texture.

So my sister and I promptly polished them off as second dinner. These were the only redeeming aspect of dining at Kingdom of Dumpling. I probably won't be back for dine-in, but I would consider coming back for boiled dumpling take-out if I'm in the area.", "author": "Leslie H."}

I went on yelp and saw this place.\n\nWhen everyone reviewed this place as small, please do not take that lightly. It is definitely a small small small space. If you are coming for dinner, please do intend to come early as there might be a wait for a table. I came for lunch, no wait, fast and breezy.\n\nService was decent, you wouldn't have the waitress coming every 15 minutes to check on you, but you wouldn't have to go looking for the waitress to get some service either. So we picked out the recommended dishes such as the xaio lung bao [6/order], shrimp and pork chive dumpling [boiled, comes in 12/order], chicken and napa cabbage dumpling [fan fried, comes in 10/order], garlic string beans, and beef pancake. Okay, I just realize that is actually a lot of food, but it was split among three people.\n\nXiao Long Bao: it was good, you can definitely taste that its handmade, fresh and lighter on the flavor. The skin is thin enough where about 1/3 of our dumplings' soup got drained when it got to our table. A little disappointing, but I manage to overlook it. $5 for 6 dumplings, a little heavy on the price\n\nShrimp and Pork Chive Dumpling: The skin is a bit doughier, but meant to be that way. With their housemade sauce, it was excellent.\n\nChicken and Napa Cabbage: Since it was fan fried, the texture was way better. You do get 10 instead of 12, but the crunchy texture makes up for it\n\nGarlic String Beans: Some call it a little bit salty, but some call it perfectly seasoned. It depends on personal preference. But some veggie on the table is good when you have balls of meat in every other dish\n\nBeef Pancake: it was okay, pan fried pancake stuff with a patty of beef. It's serves up to 4 people and it was okay. Nothing to rave about, but it's something new to try. It could be fried a little bit longer.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

Now.. i don't normally eat spicy but this sauce is sooo good that I can't resist scooping a little on my plate for an extra kick. \n\nThey have great noodle soups and onion pancakes as well. If you like green beans? They make the best dish where they fried the string beans, then stir fry it with a sweeten black bean sauce. As for dessert, the Shanghai donut is phenomenal. They are flat doughy sweet treats filled with fresh sweet black sesame paste.

We had to beg for water a couple of times before being brought glasses.  Same for spicy orange sauce.  Then they brought the bill and forgot one of our orders, whoops!

The walnut prawns were delicious as well and I liked how they didn't serve it on a bed of lettuce which I've seen in other restaurants. \n\nAnd to hold over my dumpling fix we ordered my pork dumplings with green chives and the crab dumplings. The dumplings are amazing and so moist! As soon as you bite into the crab dumpling the soup inside just explodes all of this rich flavor into your mouth. The only reason why I docked a star was cause both dumplings were a bit on the oily side. Every time I cut the dumpling in half I could see all of the oil spilling out.\n\nOther than that, the food was pretty good it damn near had me leaving the restaurant ready to knock out!

The restaurant is small and was full when we got there, but we only had to wait about ten minutes for a table.\n\nThe menu at this place does not seem to have a lot of variety. We were going mostly for the Shanghai Soup Dumplings. The waiter seemed to have a hard time taking our order. Food started coming out as it was ready, but we had to ask twice for our drinks and had to ask a few times about different food items.\n\nWe also ordered the onion pancake, beef pancake, vegetable dumplings, pork and chive dumplings, garlic bok choy, and garlic green beans. The vegetables and pancakes were delish. The vegetable dumplings were disgusting. The flavor and texture of the filling was completely unappetizing and the moment I bit into the vegetable dumpling I knew I didn't want to swallow it.\n\nThe soup dumplings are better at the Dumpling King in the Richmond (where you get 10 for $5 instead of 6 for $5), which is where we had intended to eat, but they are remodeling.\n\nThe disappointing food and bad service have warranted my giving the Kingdom of Dumplings only two stars.", "author": "Sarah M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-06-18", "description": "This review is from about 5 weeks ago so it's past due.  The 1 star rating is due to the terrible service I received.  I placed an order online for pick up through my Eat24 App on my Iphone for the 2nd time in 5 days since the first time I had no issues: Ordering was quick & easy (love Eat24 btw), they got my order right, when I went to pick it up it was bagged and ready to go, and food tasted great.  The only minor thing I noticed was that certain dishes seem small in portion size (namely the noodles and green beans) however my tummy was happy, therefore I was content.  The 2nd time started much in the same way.  I placed an order through my Eat24 App and was on my way with my sister to pick it up at 5:45PM -the scheduled pick up time I selected on the app upon ordering.  When we got to the tiny dumpling house, I remember gushing to my sister about how great my last experience was - expected us to be in and out just like the other day.  \n\nWhen we got there I went up to the register right by the tiny kitchen to inquire about the pick up.  The lady responded that they had no order.  She seemed overly adamant to the point of insinuating in her tone that I probably never placed an order.  I was almost questioning whether I mistakenly ordered from somewhere else, but then I of course checked my handy iphone and low and behold I had my confirmation with Kingdom of Dumplings with my order items, as well as the confirmation of my credit card payment.  I then showed her my email confirmation, and she spoke to another lady who came over and said sorry we didn't get your order but we'll make it right now.  Annoyed that we had to wait but glad someone was acknowledging that I did in fact place an order I just handed the lady my phone so she could write down the order from my confirmation email.  20 min or so later, one of the ladies came over to the small table my sister and I were waiting at and plopped down a bag of food on the table.  I was taken aback as I expected a \"thanks for waiting, here you go\" or something to that effect.  She was about to walk away when I asked her, \"Is this everything?\" Since she hadn't said a word to us, I just wanted to make sure there wasn't anything else we had to wait for.  She responded yes, without even looking at me.  \n\nAnyways, that should have been the end of it, however when I got home I discovered they had missed an order of the green beans!  Argggh as annoying as the whole situation had been, I had to call request a refund for the one dish.  I dialed the restaurant and a guy answered the phone.  After explaining that we didn't get our green beans he first insisted that we had received our full order, however after double checking he realized that was not the case.  Again, there was no apology for the situation but instead in a rude, defensive manner he said \"we can't do anything,\" and that if I want a refund I have to get it from Eat24 because they took my payment.  \n\nOMG, I wanted to pull my hair out!!!!   I completely understand that mistakes happen and I can accept that whoever was in charge of receiving orders never saw my Eat24 order for whatever reason, but for two out of the three people we dealt with (lady that plopped down the food and claimed I had the entire order), and the dude on the phone to never even acknowledge they made a mistake both showing an absolute LACK of care is where I have to draw the line!  Thank goodness there are SOOOOO many other delicious dumpling shops in SF!  For good reasonably priced food, I can live with mediocre/ average service, but being rude and dismissive when they were completely at fault is just not acceptable to me.  \n\nSpeaking of customer service of an excellent nature, it took me all of 30 seconds for Eat24 to listen to the problem, sincerely apology for the situation, and promptly promise to provide a refund in the normal processing time.", "author": "Caryn H."}

While some feel that a restaurant must look upscale and food must look like a painting from Picasso for it to be a great experience, I always tend to look for that old man/woman, small shop, have done it all his/her life, and is happy doing it.  This is the place.\n\nThere is nothing fancy about this tiny little dumpling house.  It's small with low ceilings and can probably fit no more than 15 people at a time.  They easily get packed due to limited space so expecting a wait would make it less painful.  For that reason I love getting my orders to go to avoid the wait.\n\nThe owner of this place has quite the charm and always welcomes his guests with a smile n open arms.  I always feel as if I am being invited into his home for his delicious hand made dumplings.  Warm and cozy.\n\nI usually order their lamb dumplings.  For the most part all their dumplings will come out looking similar but they have different fillings. I like the slight gamey flavor of lamb.  The flour that contains the meat is nicely chewy and denseness that gives a pleasant bite almost like a soft pillow with treasure inside waiting to be discovered.\n\nIf you are in search of some great Shanghai Dumplings aka Xiao Long Bao, this place won't disappoint. In chinese 'xiao long' refers to the little bamboo steam baskets you normally see at dim sum restaurants.  'Bao' means dumpling or bread.  You will see many people refer to them as XLB on the internet.  XLB is one of those things that really showcase a persons skill and love for the dumplings itself.  That love is then transferred to the guest in a form of euphoria when they take that bite.  XLB when done right is a little steamed dumpling with a nice thin chewy BAO that holds pork and something of soup inside. Lots of soup without the thin BAO breaking even as you pick it up with your chopsticks shows love and skill.  Thick BAO and no soup just means they didn't care or pay attention to the details.  You give me an XLB and I can tell you if the creator loves their BAO.  Over here, he loves his BAO and he loves to share it with all his guests.\n\nI've had better XLB in a couple of places in the US but in SF this rivals the short list (if any) of good spots.\n\nThey also offer many other authentic asian and shanghai dishes many of which are worth trying.  I personally stick with the dumplings.  Biting into those little pillows of love in a little hole in the wall is my kind of thing on any given day.\n\n4 stars only because their XLB stands behind a few really great ones I've had.", "author": "Colin M."}

He was nice and patient enough to explain to us the technique - 1) pick up a dumpling with your chopsticks; 2) bite a little piece of the side towards the bottom; and 3) suck out the soup but be careful because it might be hot.  It was a great experience!  You truly have to enjoy every sip and every bite, especially since they were handmade w/ love :)\n\nWe also had the green onion pancake and the shrimp & chive dumplings which were both really good.   I believe they make and sell all their dumplings (and more) at the Asian American Food Company aka Kingdom of Dumpling on Noriega.  If you like their dumplings, then go to their store and stock up on some!  I did!", "author": "jesiree b."}

The salt and pepper deep fried tofu were quite interesting too, they're like the ones you'd get at a pmt place but the salt and pepper is so much better (its got that numbing spice in it). I also got the beef tendon noodle soup but that was, god, I have no other word but terrible. \nFor dessert, sorry i don't know the name in English for it but if you explain it to the waiter they'll know what you're talking about, it's a puff filled with hot sweet black sesame paste and topped with sesame seeds.

For me, soupy things and dumplings just spell out the most perfect things to have to warm you right up.  \n\nCame here for an early dinner--before 6pm-ish.  And luckily, we only had to wait about 5 minutes.  Kingdom of Dumpling is a hole-in-the-wall place in all aspects; from the non-obviousness exterior, to literally feeling like you are dining in someone's low-ceiling garage.  The whole environment spells out seedy! \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r19XhpINtQxhMwB0eKnmjA?select=4MhJsu-9LF7YTMtvrjF6Pg\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r19XhpINtQxhMwB0eKnmjA?select=26xD66-_AIE2JMZP-3W1HQ\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r19XhpINtQxhMwB0eKnmjA?select=1i76RAseg6wQttzQOfdhjg\n\nLuckily, being from San Francisco, you really know not to judge a spot by it's cover.  And despite the stuffy-ness from the low ceiling of the dining room, it was actually quite cozy and warm given the nippy weather outside. \n\nMind you, if you don't speak Mandarin, you might have a difficult time figuring out what certain items are because of the fact that the descriptions on the menu all are pretty similar.  \n\nFurthermore, the server's speak minimal English.  The owner, if you are lucky to have him on site, is friendly and cheerful and speaks great English.   But overall, you must definitely just go with your gut here when ordering.  \n\nSo one of the items with all of the talk is of course the Shanghai Soup Dumplings (Siew Loong Bao).  6 Dumplings for $4.95  Perfectly steamed, with a nice chewy texture; great amounts of broth inside as you bite into the dumpling.  I love the feeling of burning my mouth as I pop these little things in! Lol...it's a little fetish of mine.  =X\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r19XhpINtQxhMwB0eKnmjA?select=EVHwrCGmhXQAM2B6lHW09A\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r19XhpINtQxhMwB0eKnmjA?select=qdziasSuLL_E8yd5-HjL7g\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r19XhpINtQxhMwB0eKnmjA?select=WKNAPBJdmAtAriwGJ2aZBg\n\nAlso ordered the Pork Dumplings with Napa Cabbage.  12 Pieces for $5.95.   Also quite yummy and nicely stuffed with pork.  I like when my dumplings are boiled and steamed perfectly without a sticky texture that I so often experience at other spots. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r19XhpINtQxhMwB0eKnmjA?select=xS7L42XUAt9fH0EI85k1Vw\n\nAnother hyped-up item here is the Onion Pancake.  *Eh* For me, this item did not live up to the excitement that I was looking forward to.  Pancakes were paper thin and soggy. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r19XhpINtQxhMwB0eKnmjA?select=Bhd0uEqd6FnjHop0U_Hm_w\n\nIn need of something soupy, we also ordered the Beef Stew Soup Noodle with \"QQ\" noodles.  QQ noodles are just thin clear noodles.  Dish came with Mustard Greens, Mushrooms.  There would've been more pieces of beef, but the broth was flavorful. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r19XhpINtQxhMwB0eKnmjA?select=bUXnZzwK-NCKGstNz8EV6Q\n\nLastly, we ordered the Shanghai Style Donut.  We ordered this blindly as the server really didn't have a good description for us other than that there is sesame top.  What it actually is close to the Sesame Balls with Red Bean Paste Inside (Jin Dui, when you eat this at dim sum).  But rather, it was filled with a black bean paste and the texture of the donut is more like a flakey puff pastry.  \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/r19XhpINtQxhMwB0eKnmjA?select=D4ZSlHwECO_8lo7olrkVVg\n\nMy advice on this spot...come here if you aren't super starving as you definitely need to order a lot of dumplings to actually get full.  Our bill came out to about 30 bucks, which for dumplings is a bit steep in my eyes.  Definitely more of a snack spot. But what you will get here is a no frills meal enough to satisfy your craving for something nice and warm.  \n\nTo sum up, hole in the wall and minimal service, but maximum satisfaction to quickly warm your insides up!", "author": "Cass J."}

Normally at King of Noodles I expect the wait to be longer because they do hand made noodles which is what I usually order.  However this time I ordered the Chicken and Spinach Wonton with QQ noodles, so I expected a little faster service since it is not handmade.  Thus, the loss of one star.\n\nOther than that, the tastes and flavors are VERY similar to King of Noodles and there is a bit of a wait as the restaurant is very small and can't accommodate too many people.

As people have said, Kingdom of Dumpling definitely qualifies as a \"hole in the wall\" which is my favourite type of restaurant!\n\nAs we came late for dinner, the waiter told us we could only order once and that we couldn't order any fried dumplings (we tried to order the XLB pan fried dumplings).\n\nOther than that, we shared and ordered:\n- Onion pancake ($4) - a little on the greasy side but I like how they cooked it. It's the flat style version. Nice soft, chewy texture to it.\n- Pork and shrimp dumpling ($6) - we got 12/13 dumplings in our order. Reminded me a bit like siu mai but less pork in them. Good though.\n- Lamb dumpling with chinese vegetable ($7) - also got 12/13 dumplings in our order. Liked these ones a lot. \n- 2x Xiao long bao ($5 each) - these were disappointing. 6 dumplings per order. Amount of soup you get in each dumpling is completely arbitrary. One I ate had a good amount. The other two had only a teeny bit. Stick with their regular dumplings and you will be much more happier.\n- Pork and vegetable with wide noodle soup ($7) - nice and light tasting broth. Has a good amount of dumplings included in it (around 8?) and the noodles are perfect with the soup. Make sure you get wide noodles!

We waited a little over an hour, but the dumplings made it well worth it. \n\nHere's what you need to know: \n1) Some of the best xiao long baos I've had. There was so much soup and they were so delicious. There are six soup dumplings per order so we ordered three plates. \n2) They have really good lamb dumplings. The beef and pork are good too, but I just like lamb meat more. Twelve per order, making each dumpling around 50 cents.\n3) I never used to think anything of green beans. I thought I could eat them at home because my mom makes them the same way. I was wrong. The string beans here are so crisp and crunchy. The garlic sauce marinade is addictive. Another waiting customer recommended them and he was right when he said they sprinkle crack in them. I found myself going back for more without even knowing it. \n4) The multi-layered beef pancake was okay. They said this one takes a bit longer to make. In retrospect, I wouldn't bother and would probably order some more dumplings instead. \n5) The green onion pancake was good, but not out of this world amazing. Again, use monetary resources for more dumplings. \n6) This place is cheap! 54 dumplings divided amongst five people and an order of string beans, beef pancakes, and green onion pancakes cost a total of only $55.

Or even Tong Palace.

Apparently, however, this is business-as-usual, because when we went for dim sum two weekends later, the same thing happened. The manager even gave a long, slightly frantic speech to an actually fairly serene clientele apologizing for the delay given the demand from the approach of Chinese New Year and having to send out for more trays of handmade dumplings . . .\n\nAnyway, the dumplings were worth a longer wait. We had the shanghai soup dumplings, which were as good as their reputation, and pork dumplings, as well as \"Chinese donuts\" and sesame pancakes for makeshift dim sum. Now, I'm embarrassed that I went to Kingdom of Dumpling for dim sum because dim sum is Cantonese and Kingdom of Dumpling is not, which is why they don't have a real dim sum service.

Seeing the reviews on yelp, I guess it's a do-able place. My dad who passes by often says there's usually a long long long line outside. But the four of us went anyways and got to the restaurant around 6:30. We were seated within 5min. I guess it wasn't busy yet. I looked around and the restaurant looks like it is in dire need of a health inspection and remodeling but besides that, there wasn't a free table big enough to fit the four of us. So the server put two tables by the window together and we sat length-wise facing the window looking towards the street. Not the best seating arrangement but it's manageable for such a small restaurant, we were willing to let that go. About 10 mins later, the line started to build outside. Man, we were lucky. \n\nAfter much debate on what to order, we ended up with:\n- lamb dumpling with napa (12 pieces) \n- chicken dumpling with napa (12)\n- onion pancake (8)\n- shanghai soup bun (6)\n- beef chow fun (roughly 8x14 inch plate)\n\ni'll be honest, i have had better dumplings when i was touring in beijing but for something outside of china, they're pretty legit. I preferred the lamb over the chicken. It's a different and not a generic flavor compared to the chicken. The onion pancake I wish was a bit crunchier but that's just a personal preference. The shanghai soup bun is ok. If the bun part was a bit softer, maybe it would be more like the ones my cousin's shanghainese grandma makes. Chow fun is pretty generic. Very similar to most chinese restaurants around the city. To me, it tasted better when it was lightly mixed with the dumpling dipping sauce. \n\nOverall our bill for 4 people came down to $31, pretty affordable compared to other restaurants we've been to. I did leave feeling a bit hungry but that's because we only ordered 5 dishes. Three stars because they have room for improvement.", "author": "Vickie C."}

My personal favorites are the pork with string bean and the shrimp with chives. Remarkably priced at about 50 cent each, they contain a good amount of filling with a nice, thin skin. The sesame pancake with marinated beef is another bright spot on a menu with several interesting non-dumpling offshoots.\n\nMaybe my obsession with hole-in-the-wall places stems from my humble beginnings and paranoia that my 401k is going to fail me in my time of need.

It is a TINY place!  There's probably 7-8 tables at most, each sitting about 2-4 people each.  We were seated at probably the worst table - the one right outside of the kitchen.  From one side, the kitchen blows hot air at you; from the other side, you get a cool breeze from the door outside.  The people behind us finished their food and left, so we promptly asked if we could switch.  Thankfully they let us switch!\n\nWe got lamb dumplings and a pork/chive (I think it was chives, anyways) dumpling.  I'm not a big fan of lamb because of the gamy taste, but I was a fan of the lamb dumplings!  The pork and chives dumpling was also good, but not as good as the lamb dumplings.  You could really tell that the dumplings were freshly made.  They were also really generous with the filling!  You get 10 or 12 (I forget) dumplings for about $5-$7, so it was pretty cheap!\n\nA tip - don't ever order the beef chow fun.  The noodles and bean sprouts were fine, but the beef tasted like cardboard - literally!  The beef tasted like a dry piece of cardboard that fell into the dish.  You could tell it was beef, but it was either really, really old or really, really overcooked.  So gross!\n\nOverall, the dumplings were good.

They took photos with their cell phones, and totally ignored the fact that my dumplings had been ready (I suspect) for over 20 minutes!!!  When I got to my parents - less than 5 minutes from the restaurants - the dumplings were cold. They lacked the broth that's usually contained in the dumplings.

I'll probably not come here in the future if other places nearby are open. This is more for the lack of kind atmosphere than for the edibles.", "author": "Elias A."}

The dumpling skin has to be thin and delicate but still hold the soup and meat. Well, they definitely do it right here. For the rookies, use a spoon to eat the dumplings. DO NOT puncture them with a fork or chopsticks. Be careful of the hot broth. Must consume the whole dumpling at once. \n\nThe fried shanghai dumplings are also a must. The skin is a bit thicker and more like the consistency of a bun which is how it should be. Don't let these dumplings fool you. They are packed with soup and flavor! \n\nThey have a variety of noodle soups. We had the beef stew noodles and it did not disappoint. Soup was delicious. Beef was tender and noodles were cooked al dente. \n\nI have to say the onion pancakes were a bit disappointing. It needed a bit more salt and needed to be in the frying pan a little bit longer. A little bit more onions wouldn't hurt too. \n\nService was great for a mom and pop restaurant. Owner made sure we were enjoying our food. Such a sweet man.\n\nIt is a small place.

B/c of this & 3 different cars driven, DL & Wanugee arrived very early but were able to nab 1 little table for 2--out of, maybe, 16 customers (kids included!) in one of the tiniest, most scrunched-up yet most highly regarded HITW spaces I've ever been.  Additionally this awkward, cramped setup caused a few other parties to switch tables--with plates still full of dumpling tasties--in order to accommodate the 6 Yelpers by annexing 2 tables, right next to the front door, perfect for cooling off from both the tight space--FOCUS!--and spiciness.\n\nThat said we ordered Spicy Chinese Green Beans, Beef Stew Noodle Soup, & the no-duh handmade dumplings: Pork & Spinach, Pork & Shrimp, Pork & Corn, and their signature--Pork Shanghai Dumplings or XLB--costing an average of $6.50 for 12 of those bite-sized pieces...\n\nWait. Wha?!\n\nI had Xiao Long Bao?!?! Those juicy, soup dumplings that virtually all of my Asian Yelp buddies kept yapping & yapping throughout my Yelp life?!?!?\n\nReally, Yelp friends, I was 1,000,000% clueless as Cher Horowitz that we were eating XLB the WHOLE time, until I saw Yelp highlights & Wanugee's review, 2 days after our dinner *_*.\n\nANYWAY, the XLB were unforgettably delicious & juicy for Fia's firstie.  This oblivious 5-Footer solely used her grass green chopsticks to grab hold of one XLB, dip it in that divine soy ginger sauce, & impulsively bite that piece, gushing out (by surprise) the more-than lukewarm soup inside it, rather than grab it, safely place it in the soup spoon, let the soup gush in my mouth, THEN dip it in that brown sauce.  Nonetheless, it's worth others' firsties, & my healthy hunger's intermittently begging me to eat more XLB back in the So Cal.\n\nYes, all the other mentioned, veggie-filled entrees were stand-outs as well--maybe except for the garlicky Green Beans (which was my responsibility ^_^) where I honestly had better.  Included w/ our dinner was this salmon orange-colored spicy sauce that looks & has a less viscous texture as the spicy mayo found in many sushi places.  Bottom line: the Kingdom of Dumpling crew played nobody's fool, based on their cute video in their Yelp page.  Despite a space too miniscule even for me, & despite a hurried yet graceful waitress apologetically spilling one of our dumpling orders in the middle of our table, K of D is 1000% returnable, particularly b/c I'll be self-stuffing more sweet indulgences in my short @ss figure x/ & I'll be prepped on a more finesse way to eat XLB.

Luckily we scored the last table in this hole in the wall joint.\n\nSince my last visit, they've added a weekend brunchfast menu, and that is the typical Northern breakfast fare, e.g. soymilk (hot or cold) and I believe they have the salty version as well, yoh tieo (cruller/fried donut stick), siao bing (the sesame flatcake) amongst a few other things.\n\nSo some soymilk with ma dumplizzles sounded like a good idea.\n\nHowever when David (of former David's Kitchen) came in with a new tray of freshly made Yumplings, we saw him take out a half gallon container of what appeared to be soymilk.....doh. So word to the wise, your soymilk fix may be DIY-able at home, and thus you may have to hit up some other Shanghainese joint to get the grounded from beans prep.\n\nThe brunchfast menu also included a cong you bao bing or green onion flat pancake. Now I have no idea how this is different from their \"green onion pancake\" but this was a very enjoyable toasty roasty piece (although not crispy). And as the kitchen is as small as a Chinese grandma's place, get your orders in all at once (otherwise you'll be in for a longer wait while your stomach growls for more).\n\nNow as far as their noodle soup, we got the spinach and pork won tons (hint, actually pronounced huan duan, closer to Shanghainese style) with mushrooms and a wonderous natural tasting broth. And yes noodles instead of ho fun/rice noodles. While beef noodle soup here is still purty sexay (especially the tendons which most pho restaurants should try to emulate that texture and knifework), the won ton noodle soup is no slouch either. \n\nI keep also forgetting how tasty KOD dumplings can be with only using decent black vinegar as a dipping sauce....\n\nCheap (but not fast), tasty, and good.\n\nWhat mo' can a beef no' guy ask for? \n\nNow what I don't get is why this place is good but reviews of their other noodle adventure or venture, King of Noodles, isn't as so...\n\nAwww yeah you know you love da Beef No' Guy long long time!", "author": "Ken K."}

I mean Kingdom of Dumpling is by all literal definition that.  Like many restaurants in the Sunset, it appears to be a transformed garage turned restaurant.  DUMPLINGS ROLL OUT!   \n\nIf it were me, I'd call it the Den of Dumpling (ala Diablo II for those who know).  Long lines are oft outside waiting to taste these delectable delights of deliciousness.  One of the reasons why there are crowds outside is the size of the restaurant.  The whole place probably houses around ten to twelve at most, 2 seated tables.  \n\nForewarning for those future patrons: It can get stuffy inside; you may feel like one of those steamed dumplings they serve.  At first glance, you'll also wonder where the bathrooms are to freshen up.  Hark not to fear, there's one in the back.  The only thing is that you'll have to walk through the kitchen past the gauntlet of servers and cooks.  It's an interesting sight, and yes, like I said before.  This is place is small.  \n  \nI usually get the XBL (xiao long bao...get hip to the lingo dumpling student), pork and/or chicken dumplings with green chives.  The lamb dumplings aren't too shabby either.  If you're only going to try only one, get the XBL at least.  I'm not a super fan of their green onion pancake, but their beef pancake is a nice kick before the meal.  They also have fried rice, noodle dishes, and an assortment of soup noodles.  \n\nFreshness goes a long way and these dumplings are certainly fresh.  On several occasions, I saw them have some workers double parked bringing in fresh dumplings because the restaurant ran out.  \n\nWhen you bite into a freshly cooked dumpling, have the dumpling broth squirt on your shirt even if the soup is burning your skin when it goes through your shirt.  That has to truly mean it is an awesome dumpling.  Dumpling smiles all around!", "author": "Arnold T."}

Poorly painted white walls with crooked award pictures and other assorted paintings, I found myself more interested in traffic passing by. \n\nNext, I had absolutely the worst seat in the house. The table was broken and rocked and was next to the opening to the kitchen. The kitchen and the dining area was only separated by a curtain, no door.  Every time someone walked through, the curtain moved and I was blasted by the heat coming from the wok. I'm talking like you just opened a 350 degree oven with the fan on hot. Since I was near the kitchen, the waitress would stand there to check on the other tables, but consequently it felt like I was being hovered over on during my meal. Last of all the food safety card reading 86 was literally  right next to me, making me wonder what those 14 points were knocked off for, god only knows how sanitary their kitchen is. Here's an idea, lose the table and put a statue or a fountain there, you'd loose 2 seats, but it would liven the place up at least.\n\nNow about the food. If you do decide to go and try this place out, I would not get anything else but dumplings. They were pretty good and it was the only thing I have nothing negative to say about. Chicken wings were mediocre, vinegar being the only flavor I could taste. Lastly the 3 layer beef pancake was pretty much a hamburger patty wrapped in dumpling dough and seared. It was recommended by the owner, totally not worth recommending.

I thought the meat portion could have had a bit more flavoring to it.\n\nGarlic string beans: A bit on the saltier side, but it hit the spot so I'm not complaining. I tasted more of the soy sauce than the garlic though.\n\nGreen Onion Pancake: Thin, crispy and not too oily. I like.\n\nPork dumplings with cabbage: This dish was just mehh. I thought the dumpling wrap was too thick. I tasted more of the wrap than the meat, and the meat also could have used more flavoring. \n\nPepper fried tofu: Not enough flavor, though it was fried to perfection. -.5 points for forgetting our order! We had to remind them when we were almost done with our other dishes and she ran into the kitchen and screamed in Mandarin \"One more tofu!\"\n\nTheir turnover rate is pretty quick, so we didn't have to wait too long for food (except that one dish they forgot to put in).

So much for quick and easy takeout.  This was the antithesis of that cause I could've just gone there and been seated and eating already.  So basically they wait until you get there to pay and then start making the food.\n\nAbout the food, the soup dumplings, for which they're famous for, were less than stellar.  The wrapper was too thick and chewy and lacked soup.  The pork and napa dumplings were actually pretty good, as was the garlic green beans.  Chicken wings, which were not great, come 6 per order which would be expected in an appetizer, not an entree.  Pricing wise, everything appeared inexpensive ($5 - $7), but the portion size was the smallest out of every other Asian restaurant that I have ever eaten at.

The waiters were also pretty quick and straight to the point, which to be honest, I couldn't blame them since there were tons of people waiting outside and they've been stuck in that steamy room for a while. We ordered Pork with Napa cabbage and pork with green chives dumplings as well as xiao long bao. \n\nI have to thank my boyfriend for the one who suggested the pork with green chives dumplings because eating those felt like heaven in my mouth. The dumplings were piping hot and upon picking them up, you could tell there was a lot of juices beneath the thick chewy but pleasant skin. The pork with napa wasn't too bad but the green chives really took the show with this one. I sat through the whole session in utter bliss as I dipped each dumpling in the vinegar and hot sauce and placed it in my spoon to make sure I could get a hold of any of the juices that came out. \n\nThe xiao long bao wasn't bad. The skin was made just right so that the soup wouldn't drip out but to be honest, I think I like Shanghai Dumpling King's XLB more so based on the flavoring. \n\nThe bill came out to be about $20 bucks (we also ordered a thai iced tea..which came in a paper coca cola cup) which wasn't too bad, considering how amazing the dumplings were.\n \nI am still in dumpling bliss after eating at your place almost two hours ago. ahhhhhhhhhhhh...yeah.

I will not shy away from addressing it.  Although Kingdom of Dumpling manages to steal several small victories, Dumpling Kitchen indisputably wins the throwdown.\n\nKingdom of Dumpling's eating space is woefully limited.  Do not consider arriving with a party of more than six.  We were initially stuffed into a corner, with intermittent blasts of desert heat emanating from the kitchen.  Thankfully, upon the kind owner's arrival, we were moved to a table to free us from suffering numbed limbs.\n\nKingdom of Dumpling's namesake is respectable when judged alone, but falls short in comparison to Dumpling Kitchen.  The dumplings come piled on a small plate, causing punctured skin and severe losses of dumpling soup in the buried casualties.  The ones that remain intact are tasty, with appreciably flavored fillings.  My favorite was the pork and chives.\n\nThe green onion pancakes and potstickers were decent, but we were all dismayed at the miserly portions.\n\nWhere Kingdom shines is in its noodle dishes.  The beef stew noodles presented perfectly cooked strands of noodles that were delightfully elastic.  The rarely-seen beef chow fun with XO sauce was also full of great flavors.\n\nIf Kingdom of Dumpling were not in close proximity to Dumpling Kitchen, I would not have judged it as harshly.  The food it had to offer was enjoyable, but I left with a tinge of regret.", "author": "Andrew M."}

I came on a Friday night so it was packed and they don't let you put your name down on a waiting list.

They refused and said it was too cold to go outside...are you forreal? We literally parked RIGHT in front...2 steps! My friend begged and they finally obliged. \n\nWhen we finally got seated, we went about ordering our dishes. We really wanted to try the soup dumplings but they said they were out. We asked if they had the panfried ones and the waiter said they were out so we had to settle for the regular dumplings. After we got our food, we see that a couple who came after us got soup dumplings. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? So we asked the waiter why they got soup dumplings when he said they were out and he said he thought we asked for the panfried ones, which they are out of. How does that even make sense?

What's parkside and why is it so far from civilization?\n\nI've read some great reviews and had some recommendations from my Yelp friends so of course I had to make the detour from North Beach to this remote little hole in the wall. Hole with 3 little crummy walls and about 7 little tables to it's name.\n\nI was delighted with their selection of water dumplings, beef, shrimp, and pork dumplings. They come in two little rows of 6's, hand made and with home made dipping sauces. I totally dig the combination pork and shrimp with chives for $6.75. \n\nThe best thing about Chinese places are the little kitschy things they don't even realize might exist. The totally messed up spelling on their menus, the screen door that serves as a real front door, or the lack of a door on their bathroom. That's some real kitsch and the food's pretty decent too.", "author": "Jessica K."}

Both were good (but not as yummy as the soup dumplings).  The dumplings themselves are thicker and really fill you up (in hindsight we should have ordered more of the soup version and less of the regulars).  The sweet corn in the chicken dumpling gave it an unexpected flavor but it wasn't bad.  The pork was more traditional.\n\nAlso had the XO beef chow fun.  At first glance, it seems disappointing as it's 95% noodles with very little beef and some green onions, bean sprouts and onions in between.  But the texture of the chow fun noodles was excellent - tender but not overly chewy.  I was surprised to find that we polished this dish clean.\n\nReally small place (no more than a half dozen tables) with pretty much no decor.

I really loved it before it got so popular but now the crowd just makes for a really unpleasant dining experience. This place is TINY TINY TINY. There is no waiting area whatsoever and on cold days (which is almost everyday in the Sunset) guests usually end up inside crowding around the tables. There are two tables just inches away from the door and my bf and I were some of the unlucky ones to be seated at one of these. The door is very light and kept swinging open and slamming shut, upon which a huge gust of wind blew into the restaurant. It was also really annoying to have to keep shifting our chairs around to make way for other entering customers. It wasn't the fault of the customers but I think KoD really needs to reconsider the layout of the tables. \n\nWhile the xiao long bao and the corn and pork/chicken dumpling are pretty amazing, everything else is pretty average. I've tried many other dishes here but they were nothing to write home about. On my last visit, we had also had the string beans and pan fried soup dumplings. String beans were pretty good but overly seasoned. Pan fried soup dumplings contained no soup and the skin was way too thick. \n\nService was almost non-existent even though there were 3 servers for 25 people. \n\nThis place is not good for big groups but if you must, be prepared to wait upwards of an hour.", "author": "Helen L."}

There was one girl ahead of us so we didn't really mind waiting around since we assumed the wait wouldn't be too long. When a table of two was cleared out and ready, the waitress came out to grab the next person in line. The girl in front of us was still waiting for her friend, so she let us go ahead of her, which was very nice and generous of her if i do say so myself. The waitress asked if we signed in to which we replied no. She then proceeds to tell us to sign in. At that point I was confused. I thought we had this mutual telepathic understanding that we were going to be seated next. But anyways, we just signed in as told to which another surprise came knocking to our door. WHERE THE FUCK IS THE PEN??? We looked EVERYWHERE for it. Normally places would tie a little string to the pen so it wouldn't get lost! A nice man sitting next to the door was nice enough to lend us his pen. Here's the third and final surprise. We got seated RIGHT after. What was the point of us signing in then???? The waitress didn't even cross our name off the list either! Wouldn't that lead to further confusion later on?? Oh well, whatevahz.\n\nAnyways, the food was pretty decent. Obviously, if you had dumplings in China, it would be very hard and unfair to even compare. But regardless, the dumplings were nicely cooked and had a lot of flavor. My favorite dish that night was probably the Beef Pancake. Something about it...you'll just have to try it for yourself.\n\nOverall, if you want to try some decent tasting dumplings for a fair price, then I would definitely recommend.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-07-02", "description": "We were looking forward to dumplings all day. Shanghai Dumpling King closes on Tuesdays and the Dumpling Kitchen was on vacation until 7/3. This should have been a sign to NOT eat dumplings and to wait. We were already on Taraval and this tiny restaurant was a block up from the Dumpling Kitchen.\nI came around 6pm and got a table for three. It wasn't that busy with small two-seater tables that were still vacant. I got seated right away and that was the only good thing that happened. My friends came and we were going to start with a large order of the soup dumplings and then place the rest of our orders after. First off, you can only order once. That's right, only ONE time. Get it right, cause you won't have another chance and they won't come back...not even to refill your teapot. \n\nOur order consisted of:\n1) 4 orders of Shanghai Soup Dumplings\n2) Crispy Chicken Wings\n3) XO Chow Fun\n4) Green Onion Pancakes\n\nAfter he took our order, he tried to upsell us on their garlic string bean and a bunch of other dishes. As we waited for our food, a bunch of people came to pick up their take out orders. They were simply ushered straight to the cashier and lingered awkwardly in the middle of the room. The restaurant probably seats about ~21 people comfortably with a view of the kitchen, cashier, sinks, etc...\n\nOur food came and I could not be more disappointed. The dumplings are a major disappointment. All of them were broken with the soup dripping to the bottom of the steam basket that was layered with one cabbage leaf. The dumplings weren't hot and they can be placed in your mouth without burning your tongue. They were not the steaming hot plump dumplings that I'm fond of. The green onion pancakes were okay, but were glazed with grease. I'm pretty sure they didn't make those fresh in house and tasted like the frozen kind from Sunset Super. Before the rest of the food came, the bill came out. We should have told them to cancel the rest of the order if they were going to charge us for what we didn't get. Lastly, the crispy chicken wings were not crispy, just barely cooked in a wok with some brown sauce. The skin was chewy and they weren't glazed with any flavor. They were just brown. The chow fun didn't taste like anything. The noodles were all broken apart with some bean sprouts and beef. We took it home to dress it up ourselves because the \"XO\" sauce they claimed was nonexistent. \n\nOur teapot was empty and with all the MSG on our table we asked for some water on three separate occasions. Each of us took a turn, in the span of 15 minutes, and was simply waved off, ignored, acknowledged and then ignored again, and then we just gave up. The restaurant wasn't busy and many of their tables were still empty. The check was already there so we didn't have to ask for that. We asked for a couple of boxes to take the rest of the dumplings and chow fun to take home and those came fast. Our bill came out to be $40 and thankfully we had cash. This is a no-tip situation and is highway robbery. We will not be coming back.", "author": "Vivian L."}

Actually, \"rival\" is a little too optimistic; I would've been happy just to find XLB that are somewhat close to par. (I'd be sorely disappointed at Shanghai Dumpling King and Old Shanghai before.) Perhaps my expectations were too high, but once I've had good food it's impossible for me to lower them again.\n\nAfter my dinner at Kingdom of Dumplings I think it's best to give up those hopes. The XIAO LONG BAO weren't quite soupy enough and the minuscule lump of bland minced pork inside was laughable. Worst of all, the skin was way too thick. These were not the delicate soup dumplings I've had from the experts. (For XLB in the city, I would stick to King of Noodles.)\n\nI wasn't very impressed with the other items I had there either. The GREEN ONION PANCAKE wasn't crispy and browned enough on the outside and desperately needed salt. The LAMB DUMPLINGS weren't as lamb-y as I could've expected and, again, the skin was overly thick. They just felt... monotonous; perhaps some type of dipping sauce would've helped. Also disappointing were the SHANGHAI PAN-FRIED BUNS. The pork filling-to-bun ratio was way off. I mean, I like my carbs but they need to be flavoured with something... like pork (not that the pork filling was all that great either). They also didn't do a very thorough job of pan-frying them. Pan-fried buns should have brown crispy bottoms (teeheehee), just sayin'.\n\nThe only dish my friend and I really liked was the GRILLED CUMIN LAMB SKEWERS. Wow, these were amazing!

Therefore, I prefer the ones at Shanghai Dumpling Shop in Milbrae, thick skin and all.\n\nStick to:\npork w/ napa cabbage: I loved the crunchy texture the cabbage gave the dumplings. flavor wise, it was on the bland side but the vinegar saved it. This was the juiciest amongst all the dumplings we had.\n\nXLB: same as the pork w/ cabbage except the meat seemed rough and not as finely grounded as the pork dumplings. It wasn't bad, just not as flavorful as I prefer.\n\n\nWould definitely order again:\ngarlic bok choy: WIN! LOVED this. Each bite after bite was juicy, as if they had boiled it in the same juice you find inside the XLB. Wow. It was better than their dumplings!\n\ngarlic green beans: another win! flavorful and hot, these came out with the perfect texture,not to raw, not too overcooked to the point where they were soggy.\n\ngreen chives pancake: my first time trying this and it was extremely good. It looked like a pita bread filled with clear noodles, chives, and egg inside. \n\n\nNo:\ngreen onion pancake: bland\npork dumplings w/ spinach: bland, bland, bland and super dry.\nchicken dumplings: so uninspiring, I don't even remember.\n\nMy group of 7 was lucky to get a table without waiting at 5:30pm. Prices were so good! $5 for a plate of 12 dumplings. It was about $95 before tax for our group of 7 and we were stuffed.

The soup was not too sweet (why do the Shanghai-ese have an addiction to sugar?).  \n\nWe also go the Pork with Chives and Pork with Napa Cabbage.

It was definitely juicy and you could taste the ginger.  \n\nPork Dumpling with Green Chives (12)  - soft texture, full of chives, and tasted perfect with their house hot sauce.\n\nPork Pot Stickers (6) - decent pot sticker that was steamed and pan fried and not too greasy \n\nCrispy Chicken Wings(8) - This was not crispy at all (not deep fried).  It was sitting in a lot of sauce that I have never tasted before.  Kind of a sweet and savory soy sauce.\n\nXO Beef Chow Fun - could not taste any XO flavor but it was still good.

We got fish dumplings with the QQ noodles, those were good and they stuffed it with plenty of chives.

If you're a teeny mom and pop Chinese restaurant, I can understand. But if you're a teeny mom and pop restaurant that boasts \"#8th out of 100 Chinese restaurants in San Francisco\" fliers INSIDE and OUTSIDE your restaurant, I'd think you'd be able to maybe buy one more frying pan???\n\nHow did I know they only have one frying pan? My friends and I decided to come out to SF for the day and lunch at Kingdom of Dumpling per another friend's recommendation. We arrived at this teeny hole-in-the-wall around 12 and didn't have to wait long for a table for four. The prices are quite low and really affordable for the amount of dumplings that we got. HOWEVER, they're pretty stingy on fried dumplings (since they only have ONE FRYING PAN). If you get regular dumplings, there are about 13 per order. If you want fried dumplings (which is how I usually like them), there's only 10. We ordered Shanghai soup dumplings, pork and chives, pork and spinach, and a chive pancake. There was an interesting item on the menu that I really wanted to try (FRIED Shanghai soup dumplings), but when ordering, since we wanted both orders of the pork dumplings fried and the chive pancake was also fried, the waitress probably said at least 3 times, \"we only have one frying pan, we can't fry everything for you.\" Please tell me again how you have one frying pan, dear waitress.... We ended up cancelling one of the fried items, and getting two orders Shanghai soup dumplings.\n\nOur food came out in about 10-20 minutes. In my honest and humble opinion, I have had better dumplings elsewhere. Sorry Yelp friends, but these are definitely not THE BEST ASIAN DUMPLINGS I've had in the US. The pork dumplings with chive and with spinach were honestly a little bland, and the chive pancake was meh. They gave us a good vinegar dipping sauce though, which made these items a little better. My favorite would probably have to be the soup dumpling, which is where I allocate the extra 2-stars to. Everything else, other dumplings and service (which can be kind of expected of a Chinese restaurant - I'm not racist, I swear), was pretty sub-par.\n\nWith only one frying pan, this wasn't quite the \"Kingdom\" of dumpling I was expecting.

Just saying. \nOh yeah, it is really cheap so I guess most of the faults are forgiven by most people who love to get yummy food for cheap.\n\nWe live too far for take out, but if you can avoid eating in, do it...\n\nSo the breakdown of my review is as follows:\nfood = 5 stars\nprice = 5 stars\nservice = 2 stars\natmosphere = 1 star\n\nAverage = 3.25", "author": "Nilu r."}

The place is a dive; it is stuffy, small and the seats are squished together. The layout of the seats are horrible and I've seen couples stuck behind a table in which they couldn't get out. Talk about claustrophobic. They have no ventilation to speak of so every bit of smoke and smell comes out of the kitchen directly to the dining room which btw is only separated by a curtain. Having said all that, this is a MUST VISIT for anyone who loves dumplings.\n\nI've tried basically all their dumplings, and all are pretty good. I'm partial to the pork dumplings since I think they have the best meat to veggie balance. The pork dumplings with napa, green chive and celery are all excellent. I usually get 1 to 1.5 orders per person, so go with friends and grab 4 or 5 orders. The XLB is ok, but not as much soup filling as other places so I don't get it anymore. But for your first visit, go for it.\n\nThe appetizers are awesome, I recommend the farmer's cucumbers (marinated in a savory/sweet/vinegar sauce), the chicken wings and the cilantro bean thread. Last but not least I highly recommend the beef stew with noodles. The soup base is scrumptious.\n\nI would stay away from the fried noodles and fried rice. They are ok but save your appetite and order more dumplings.

Why not 5 stars for Kingdom?  The skin is still a little thick and gets hard after sitting out for 3 minutes while skin like Ding Tai Fung or Yank Sing keep for 15+ minutes.  The meat and the soup was FANTASTIC!  The meat consistency was fluffy and not too fatty.  The soup was not too fatty which can get too overwhelming after about a dozen.  So the soup and the meat - 5stars, the skin pulled it down to 4 stars but still a hell of a soup dumpling.  \n\nBeware the lines get VERY long and there is no signup sheet so who gets in first is based on their memory and your honor system.

We got 2 types of dumplings to share.  The Pork with Napa cabbage had plenty of vegetables; they were not too salty; & they were not too fatty either.  The Lamb with Chinese vegetables were juicy, not too fatty, & had a lot of vegetables.  To end the meal, we ordered the Shanghai style donuts.

Get two orders if you are hungry. Skin was near perfect! Filling tasty! The broth was superb! (btw, for the newbie remember to eat using a spoon and drain it before you have a hot soup explosion in your mouth - not in a good way)\n\nSheng Jian Bao - SJB  is XLB's fried cousin. A popular street food, I think it needs better PR in the US. More doughy, and if done right, greasy yummy. They are good here (though I wouldn't mind more grease)\n\nStir Fried Bok Choy - get some veggies to help with all that meat and carbs.\n\nBeef Noodle Soup - Nice as a soup to share. Lot's of gristle. Mmm.. They have a spicy pepper sauce on the table. Put that in the soup and it'll be a party in your mouth.\n\nSaw the pancakes and Luo bo gao, both looked delicious but need to save for another time. Same goes for the extensive variety of dumplings. A Kingdom of Dumpling indeed!\n\nRestaurant: \n* Very small. Don't try going with more than a group of 4. 2 is ideal\n* Try to not sit next to the door (on windy days you'll have a blast of air everytime people go in or out, but, if it is the only place, take it. The food is worth it)\n* Go off hours. I went at 3 on a Sunday, and got a seat right away.\n\nStaff: I got my place setting, tea, food ordered no problem, food came, we ate.

Came here with 4 people including me and here's what we ordered & what I have to say! :D\n\nFood - DUMPLINGS! DUMPLINGS!! DUMPLINGS GALORE!!! Here are the few items I had and what I have to say about them:\n- Pork & Chive dumplings (12/order): GOT TWO ORDERS OF THESE! So GOOOOOOD!!\n- Fried Shanghai dumplings (4/order): The first order of these were delicious! Soft on the outside & inside and crispy on the bottom! However, maybe they over cooked the second order of this that we got because one of them was popped and the bottom was a little burnt~~\n- Shanghai Dumplings (6/order): DELICIOUS! I would go back JUST for these! I was craving this all day and this just hit the spot! :) Wish they had some red vinegar though! (They only had the black vinegar)\n- One of their fried Rice: Was extremely full after all those dumplings... Originally, this was suppose to be a stomach filler in case we didn't get full off of those dumplings but... we were so full that we couldn't even eat much of this and ended up taking this to go~~ It was okay though... would definitely rather have another plate of dumplings instead!\n- Thai iced tea: A little on the sweet side, served in a cocacola paper cup, big cup, and definitely ghetto!! ... but delicious~ :)\n\nPrice - Reasonably priced if not cheap! 12 pork & chive dumplings for 5.95 :D Shanghai dumplings for 4.95, I believe? well, you probably get the idea. Everything is priced reasonably~ haha!\n\nService - This is one of the first places in SF that I've been to where the owners aren't cantonese! They speak mandarin but this one girl in there speaks English so fear not if you don't speak mandarin! They are very considerate too! When we went there was a small line (a group of 2 people and 4 people in front of us) but we were still waiting for 2 more people... as soon as they sat the two groups in front of us, they had a table opened and sat us down even though the other two people in our party weren't here yet. We were FREEZING outside (because there's no waiting room inside since it's a hole in the wall-like place) and it was so nice and considerate of them to let in. My friend and I decided to order first before the two other people came so we can start eating and 35 minutes later, the other two people finally came. I felt really bad because we were holding up an extra two seats when there were other parties waiting outside too~ But I guess they were seated pretty quickly too since the first dinner rush was going away. I guess my point here is that... even though the place is small, and there usually is a line, don't worry because the wait isn't that long!~\n\nAtmosphere - A hole in the wall. Super small. It looks like it's someone's garage converted into a restaurant. It's a bit stuffy inside though since the place is small and filled with hot food/dumplings, people, and steam from the kitchen but it's nice when it's cold outside because you're instantly warmed up! I do think they need a few vents though... to vent the place because the windows were so fogged up with condensation, it looked like it was raining! Haha~\n\nI will definitely come back here again when I'm back in the city! A $6 order of dumplings for lunch from here would be perfect in taste & price! :)\n\nOh yeah! They also do take out if you don't want to wait at all or if you want to eat elsewhere!", "author": "Carin S."}

The owner is nice and apologetic for his poor service, but that's still really no excuse.  He doesn't know how to wait tables effectively, so he needs to just hire a professional waiter/waitress.  1 table of guests actually walked out the door because they waited like 20 mins to have their orders taken. Food takes FOREVER to come out.  All the dumplings should be and pre-made and should only take a few minutes (less than 5mins) to boil and re-heat.  Everything took at least 15-20mins to come out.  Very poor operations.  \n\nDECOR:\nIt is very run-down, and all the pre-decorations are still there... Thai words and signage.  Place is not the cleanest.  This is a tiny restaurant. Do not go if you have more than 3 ppl in your party. Otherwise, it will require 2 tables put together.  And since the food takes a long time to come out, you are on for a long wait.n  It's not like the guests don't want to hurry up with their meal... They couldn't since they're waiting for their food!!\n\nFOOD:\nIf you call yourself the Kingdom of dumplings, you better have the best dumplings in town.  My POV:  Nah.  The Shanghai Dumplings are pretty good. The Pork/Shrimp/Chive dumplings - Nah.  The meat is rough.  We also ordered the soup noodle (flat noodle) with spinach wontons.  The flat noodle was horrible... all lumped together.  The spinach wontons were just OK.  I was somewhat disappointed all around.   Also, ditch the old menu. Your specialty is the dumplings and that's already enough to keep the cook busy... they are not equipped to serve curry, thai food, salads, etc.  It's plain stupid. \n\nPRICE:\nFor the 3 dishes I mentioned above, total bill was $20 with Tip and Taxes.

Not that it's a bad thing - I love eating very hot food right off of the stove, but the temperatures were mouth-burning.  It is an exercise in patience to hold off on the yummy for a few minutes, but well worth it.\n\nThe prices were reasonable and if you have a dumpling craving, you owe it to yourself to make your way over to the kingdom and stuff your face good and proper.\n\nI'll definitely be back to try other things on the menu, like the Chicken and Corn dumplings, and the cilantro bean noodles.\n\nObviously this place begs for a comparison to the much-beloved Shanghai Dumpling King - I will say this:  they are different, and both worth trying.  Kingdom of Dumpling has not experienced the popularity surge of SDK, so it feels a little more homey and less of a scene, and I think the quality is slightly better as well, although the XLB at SDK are simply excellent.\n\nIf you can't go for a sit-down meal, visit their location on Noriega for some frozen dumplings to make yourself.", "author": "Liz S."}

The pork and chive dumplings had a low meat:vegetable ratio.\n\nWe also ordered the duck curry special (comes with white rice).  The curry was nice and spicy and tasty.  The rice was solid, albeit unspectacular.  The duck though was dry and overcooked with pieces of bone and cartilage mixed in.   And no tasty duck fat!  Very disappointing considering its price ($9) relative to the rest of the menu.\n\nOverall, the meal cost $27 with some leftovers.  If you are in the mood for dumplings, I would avoid this place and go to Shanghai Dumpling King where they have better prices, food, and cleaner dishes.  Otherwise, you may want to bring your own utensils and plates.", "author": "Bowdoin S."}

Few in the Bay Area has been able to touch that echelon of dumpling prowress, but Kingdom of Dumpling is probably one of the best that get as close as they can to the truly perfect, close to Asia soup dumpling. \n\nIn my opinion, when you pick up a soup dumpling, you can almost immediately tell if it's really going to be THAT good of a dumpling because the skin should sag a little with the weight of the soup, but be thin enough to make you wonder \"how the hell did they do that?\" It's a hard thing to do, but it really is one of the hallmarks of great soup dumplings. Kingdom of Dumpling achieves that and I enjoy how their dumplings are not too large nor small. Their other dumplings are also pretty good, and the radish cakes are good too - flaky on the outside but not soggy from the shredded radish within. \n\nI usually don't mind that they are kind of cramped, however I had to deduct points for when they told us mid-dumpling bite that we'd have to hurry it up/get out soon and wouldn't let us add to our order saying they had warned us (they didn't) since there were people waiting. Also, nitpicky but their tea is from teabags and not leaves, and usually incredibly weak. But overall, I really enjoy coming here - just need to make sure it's in the off hours so you don't feel like they want to kick you out mid-dumpling.", "author": "Jocelyn C."}

This place has only about 10 tables and the staff there is very nice and helpful.  I went during the weekday, and plenty of street parking and it was not crowded at all.\n\nFor me.......It is closer to go to the Shanghai Dumpling King on Balboa St., plus their XLB has a more delicate skin wrap and I will say that theirs is the best XLB.\n\nThis restaurant's XLB ($5.) is very good too, but I prefer the other restaurant as a first choice for me.  Here you get 6 and the other place gives you 8 XLB.\n\nThe dish of vinegar/soy sauce for the XLB is so tiny that it is hard to dip the dumplings in it.  The dipping sauce is okay, but Shanghai King on Balboa St. has a better dipping sauce. \n\n-Green onion pancake was very good and I would order that again. \n-Garlic green beans were cooked to perfection and delicious.  \n-Pork and napa cabbage dumplings was another winner and you get 12 of them.\n-Grilled lamb skewer has good flavor, but I found it to be okay...and bit tough and not tender.  I will not need to order this next time  \n-Shanghai donut  ($3.) was piping hot and you have to let it cool, but that was a nice treat if you like black bean with a flaky outside and sesame seeds on top. It's good, but not a must to order.\n\nFor 6 dishes it was $36.  \n\nI will go again, if I'm in the neighborhood, but for me it's not worth the drive from the other side of town.", "author": "Nanana A."}

The lights were off, and the only sounds were those of the other two diners slurping their noodles.  So we got sat at a table in the front corner by the window, the windowsill coated in dust and the crumbs and shedded hair of diners past to my right, the white wall behind the table spattered in old dumpling grease, broth and vinegar.  My chair squeaked too.  This didn't really bother me, but your mileage may vary.\n\nSo here's what we ate:\n\nLamb Dumplings: Yep, it was definitely lamb in there but not too strong.  They were juicy but not waterlogged and the wrappers were neither too thick nor too thin.  They went well with the hot sauce on the table and the black vinegar that the waitress brought.\n\nPork & Cabbage Dumplings in Soup W/ Noodles: If we had them on their own, they would have been a little better.  But floating in soup, their wrappers got kind of soggy.  Slices of mushroom and pieces of bok choy rounded out the soup but couldn't hide the fact that the chicken broth tasted like it came out of a can.\n\nFarmer's Cucumbers: This was probably the best thing we had.  A dish of torn cucumbers quickly marinated with garlic, sesame oil, a little soy sauce, and a dash of vinegar.  Refreshing yet deeply flavored,it was the perfect foil to the rich dumplings.", "author": "Suo L."}

Its a hole in the wall joint, and if you can't appreciate those kinds of places, then IMHO - don't go. Sure theres six tables, a curtain separating the dining room from the kitchen, and grease on the walls - I'll take that any day if you give me delicious food. I'll be damned if you find food thats as fantastic at a she-she restaurant elsewhere. \n\nEver since I saw Anthony Bourdain's episode of Shanghai, I was on a quest to find the best soup dumplings in the city. And I think even if its out of the way for some, the location (cold, foggy, misting outer sunset) for the type of food you're ordering (hot, steamy, spicy goodness) makes it all worthwhile. The first time I went, I was with the bestie:\n\n- Bean Curd Noodles with Cilantro\n- Pork Dumpling with chives\n- Garlic string beans\n- Shanghai soup dumplings\n\nPerfect. I was surprised at the bean curd noodles and how much I really enjoyed them! Couldn't believe they were tofu!. Pork dumplings - hearty, delicious and FILLING. As for the garlic string beans, I couldnt believe how delicious, crunchy, and complimentary they were to our meal. Finally the soup dumplings. HOLY CRAP. He advised us to dip in the soy vinegar, bite off the top and slurp out the insides. Freaking orgasmic. Next time I went, I got the green onion pancake. HOT. as in HEAT hot. And as other yelper's mentioned, its a little bit greasy, but just the outside because they need to get that crispy exterior which I love oh so much. So give me the grease.\n\nI would give this first experience 5 stars alone, but the rest of the times I've been there, the server is always in the back of the kitchen - and I always need another beer. And ice water. So thats really the only reason it gets four stars. If it was based soley on the food - 5 all the way.", "author": "Jacklyn S."}

I've eaten here in the past (as a party of 2) and everything tasted fresh and the dumplings were definitely prepared well. They did not fall apart while holding them with chopsticks and the fillings were seasoned right.\n\nThe reason for my 1-star review is that they really disappointed me by a series of  actions. I know this place is not a big restaurant. The dining area is about as large as my living room. I was reluctant to impose upon them a larger party than 4 people, so I called to see if they would take a reservation for 5 adults and 1 child. Keep in mind, a \"no\" would have been perfectly acceptable... no hard feelings.\n\nThe day of the actual reservation, I had to change the reservation to 6 adults and 3 children. The other option would have been to place an order to go and eat at my house (I live in the neighborhood). So, I called to see if I could place an order for takeout and was told to call back later. I called back later to see if I could change the reservation to 9, instead of 6. Once again, knowing how small this place is, a \"no\" would have been perfectly acceptable as well... no hard feelings. But I was told that it would be \"no problem\". So we scrapped the idea of take out, and decided to take their word for the reservation.\n\nPacked everyone into 2 cars and drove over. We arrived at our reservation time and the dining room was at capacity; plus there were 3 parties (2-4 guests per party) waiting for tables. I walked over to the person that appeared to be in charge and asked him what the expected wait time might be. I was told it might be about 15 minutes. Under normal circumstances, 15 minutes might be OK. But there is no waiting area to accommodate 15 people in this restaurant (not criticizing... just pointing it out) and the weather was rainy and cold (about 42 degrees outside).\n\nAlso, having grown up in the restaurant business, I know when someone is ambitiously overpromising on something. 15 minutes was eagerly optimistic about getting 4 tables to clear in the right area of the dining room to accommodate 6 adults & 3 children. Also, there was no way we were going to order take out at this point. The wait time would have been too long, with the kids in tow and no place to wait... We ended up walking down to the next restaurant which I've been to many times where the service is always awesome and the food (albeit not dumplings) is always equally as good as the service.\n\nBottom line, it really pisses me off when a restaurant doesn't have the balls to say \"no\" and/or doesn't have ability to manage their reservations and seat turns effectively.", "author": "Ray C."}

I didn't expect good soup inside the dumplings but was pleasantly surprised by the absolutely tasty savory broth and meat goodies inside. We also ordered the crispy chicken wings that came slathered in a delightful subtle plumlike sauce. The chicken wings were crispy on the outside and fun to nibble and suck on the bones. Reading other yelp reviews, everyone was crazy about the lamb skewers. We ordered those too and I have to say they were the best lamb I've eaten anywhere. The first bite was so tasty that a flood of saliva rushed in my mouth. I never wanted it to end. The only misstep we made was the sesame pancake with beef order. It tasted like a weird confused salami sandwich dipped in holisin sauce. It wasn't gag inducing but it just wasn't our thing. \n\nThe prices here are reasonable. The service is ok.

I was a party of 2 and the restaurant was full at the moment. Shortly after me 2 separate parties of 6 wrote their names down. 15 minutes later a couple exited the restaurant. Naturally I thought,  \"yay I'm next\". NO. That is not what happened. Instead a male worker came out and told me the 2 ppl who just left were sitting at a 4 person table and they had a small table to combine with it to accommodate the 6 and asked if I wouldn't mind waiting a little longer. I understood how hard it would be for them accommodate the 1st party of 6 since the place is so small so I said no, I don't mind waiting, I'll wait for the next free table since it looked like a table would free up shortly. Another 5-10 minutes passed and a large group left a girl worker came out and called the 2nd group of 6. Now this is where I got mad. I interjected and told her I've been waiting and I already gave up my table the first time and that I should be seated. Mind you, the table they were gonna give away were 2 small tables pushed together which could've accommodated my bf and I and another couple who also was waiting. The girl retreated back inside. \n\nThe same male worker who asked me the first time came out speaking mandarin (obviously to keep hush what was going on but I don't speak mandarin). We exchanged words in a calm fashion, in the end I said \"fine whatever\". He promised 5 minutes and I'd be seated. 10-15 minutes later I was over the thought of eating here and left.

For this reason my review might be a little biased, but...amazing food is amazing food and all the Yelpers before me definitely don't have it wrong - Kingdom of Dumpling is delicious!\n\nBe forewarned this place is TINY - housing only 7-8 tables, so you have to come with the expectation that you WILL be waiting for a table, especially during lunch/dinner hours. I came here on a Saturday around 1PM and had to wait about 30 minutes for a table (there were 4 parties before us). There were no sign-in sheet which baffled me a little. The owner or host spent more time trying to figure out which waiting parties were the first, so definitely there's room for improvement here.

I did like the potstickers, they took the whole time to cook it, but totally worth it - skin uber crispy while inside maintained its juiciness.", "author": "Vanessa K."}

Was forewarned by yelp not to go on peak hours so I went in around 2PM on a Friday.  It was about 1/3 full, which wasn't hard seeing as the place was so tiny (maybe fit 15-20 people MAX).\n\nBeef Pancake:  Hmm never thought having meat in a pancake could taste so good.  A little soggy in the middle but that's ok.  The vinegar-ginger sauce helped a lot.  3 Starz.\n\nXiao Long Boa:  New word I learned!  I don't know what it means or how they do it but somehow there are steamed dumplings with soup in it and it is super yummy!  4.5 Starz.\n\nPork & String Bean Dumplings:  Absolutely my favorite!  Eat hot or cold (better hot) and with sooo much meat + my favourite veggies!  So cheap!  How could I not order 2 orders??  4.5 Starz.\n\nTofu Noodles w/Cilantro:  WOW!  How the hell does anyone make noodles out of tofu?  I was impressed.  Not a big fan of cilantro but the sesame seed oil was a great sauce to toss!  4 Starz.\n\nRed Bean Deep Fried Dessert Thing:  My least favourite.  I'm not a big dessert person but I thought they overdid it by frying.  It's ok, I went here for the dumplings. 3 Starz.\n\nEven though I usually abhor Chinese food, it's hard for me to pass up hand-made fresh dumplings with my favourite ingredients.

This dingy little restaurant serves some of the best dumplings in San Francisco and in such an Asian city, that's saying something. \n\nI've visited multiple times and have tried many of the menu items. My personal favorites are the Shanghai dumplings, filled with a well-made broth and the chicken and corn dumplings, very savory, yet offering the right amount of sweetness. I also like the onion pancakes which were panfried, though on occasion they are a tad soggy and need to be eaten quickly. The lamb dumplings are a touch gamey, but many people I go with prefer it as such and I don't mind either way. \n\nThe service is very accommodating, the only drawback being the lack of waiters. It is small and seems family-run. They offer frozen dumplings to go in mass quantities and it really warms my heart to see them bringing fresh, hand-made dumplings by the tray-fulls each night. They really do it right. \n\nOverall, the locale and sometimes the wait brings this down to four stars. This has nothing to do with the delicious offerings.

If there are Chinese people who can dedicate an entire restaurant to dumplings, you KNOW we mean srs bsns. Stopped by on a Wednesday afternoon for lunch and lucky for us, there was one table left waiting for us. Normally I'd be leaping with joy when this happens because I feel extra special, like the foodie Gods have blessed me for this exact moment. But this particular restaurant (is it even big enough to be called a restaurant?) is like the size of a closet, so the foodie Gods must have been showering me with golden rain of unicorn tears or something by leaving us this one table. There are only like 5 or 6 small tables and can probably fit like 20 people if you want to sardine it up. It reminds me of those small restaurants/food tents in China, which is actually pretty awesome because those spots usually have the best food on the low low. Anyway, we ordered: Shanghai Soup Dumplings (siu long baos), Pork & Spinach Dumplings, and Beef Pancakes. Everything came out in about 10-15 minutes which is average for dumpling cookage (my gma makes them all the time, please don't tell her about this. It would break her soul).  The siu long baos were my absolute favorite! The texture was perfection and was mouth watering delectable accompanied by KoD's own crack-like vinegar sauce. That vinegar sauce can make dirt taste delicious, oh my good god. The pork dumplings were really good too, though not as memorable. And the beef pancakes are pretty much Chinese style quesadillas lol. Eat them fresh while they're still crunchy, though. \n\nI need to come back asap for more siu long baos!

Since it's away from other shops, parking is easy to find. But the place is pretty busy, even on a random weekday noon. \n\nGreat dumplings! $5.95 for the 12 of most basic cabbage pork or chive pork. Or get them frozen and bring them home at the same price for 22 (why not 24?). Chewy/al dente skin, tasty fillings...very yum. The price is fair, not super cheap I mean considering its location. \n\nMediocre shanghai xiaolong bao though. They looks great, but I've had better in the Bay Area. Maybe it's the skin not thin enough, maybe it's the flavor of the fillings. Either way, the price is cheap, but I probably won't order it again. \n\nSome appetizer dishes were oddly overpriced though. Like the coriander bean curd skin salad for $5.95. That's like 12 dumplings! For a mere plate of bean curd skin tossed with some oil and coriander! I guess it's my fault for ordering it. \n\nI think they place used to be a Thai fusion of some sort, perhaps? They have some leftover menu item on the Special sign and on the menu taped to the wall. Like, curry eggplant with brown rice. Or pan seared duck breast with some sauce. Oh, and the weirdest has to be the dessert they listed: creme brulee.

Ordered Pork, Shrimp Dumplings with Chives (12 in order), Shanghai Soup Dumpling (6 in order), Beef Pancake, Onion Pancake, XO Beef Chow Fun. When I got home, we ate the last three for dinner. The beef pancake was not crunchy and I don't know how to describe the flavor except it wasn't that great. The Onion Pancake was not crunchy and had no flavor, the XO Beef Chow Fun tasted worse than Panda Express if they sold Beef Chow Fun. There was no hint of XO sauce at all or perhaps their XO just means best quality and not XO sauce. My sister even asked me, was this actually cooked by Chinese people?!?! LOL. The next morning came the dumplings and wasn't that great either, the frozen stuff from Safeway and Trader Joe's tasted better. There was not even 20% shrimp in each of the dumplings which were small enough as is.\n\nSeems like people only like their hot sauce or something which means they wouldn't be able to taste the flavor of the stuff anyways. What's interesting is the prices at the restaurant was way lower than the online menus. The restaurant was small, had only 9 tables which can sit one person at each side and there were three chairs outside the door to wait and you basically need to put your name on the notepad aka waiting list for those who even recognize it as such.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-05-11", "description": "The best Xiao Long Bao (XLB as some call it) I've ever had! I travel out of town a lot so every time I return to SF I have to come here again as soon as I can.\n\n**This is not to be confused with Dumpling Kingdom or House of Dumpling just one or two blocks down on Taraval.\n\nIt is a small, hole-in-the-wall, cramped, little sit-down restaurant like the kinds you get in Asia. Not meant for a long romantic dinner, business meeting, or large groups (although I've seen them accommodate up to 6-8 people at one table). You should be here only for the XLB and not for social gatherings.\n\nThey don't take reservations so if you are coming in for dinner, I recommend coming in really early like 5-6pm. If you come at 7pm or later, you will probably put your name on a really long list and have to wait out in the cold for up to 1 hour or longer to be seated and when you get seated, they might limit you to only one round (6 pieces) of XLB because they are running out.\n\nI can't say they give the best customer service by American standards. However, imho, they are pretty nice and accommodating by Asian standards. I feel bad for them sometimes because they get some nasty customers. One time this guy put his name on the list for a group of 5-8 people and asked the waiter to call him on his phone when a table frees up for them. The waiter told him they don't call customers but they can leave their name on the list. Meanwhile, he and his whole group goes around the nearby residential neighborhood laughing and joking inappropriately at an inconsiderately loud level. The rest of us on the list were waiting patiently outside the restaurant. He comes back after a long while and gets upset when he sees they gave a table to someone whose name was after his on the list. He then pesters the poor waiter for the next 5-10 minutes trying to persuade him to call him when the next table frees up, acting like he was giving the waiter a second chance. The waiter kept telling him really nicely that they never call their customers on the phone to be seated. Someone needs to be waiting outside to be called. (They don't even request that the whole party be present to be seated). The waiter finally brushes off this guy and goes inside to continue serving. The guy turns around and comments smugly to all of us waiting, \"sometimes you just got to do what you got to do to get what you want\", to which nobody responds to him. This guy has no shame. I saw a similar thing happen again at a later occasion.\n\nI have to say though, even though this place is great for XLB and green onion pancake, the rest on the menu are kind of just fillers. I wouldn't recommend coming here for a full course meal. So if you are feeling like a light, quick, cheap, filling, and absolutely delicious Asian dinner, come on in early and order some XLB! :)\n\nNote: Do not be greedy and order too many servings of XLBs though. I once did that (ordered 3 servings for 2 people) and overdid it. Didn't return for a few months until I started craving XLB again.", "author": "Liz C."}

Being our first visit, mother and I both ordered dumplings. She had chicken and celery, I had pork and shrimp with chives. Each order came with 12 average sized dumplings.  After reading some Yelp reviews, we added an onion pancake as well. \n\nFirst off, the dumplings are made after you order which means great freshness. However, we experienced our first disappointment when it came out. The dumplings were boiled instead of steamed.  Maybe because they have to be boiled, but the wrapping or 'skin' was also really thick - like a pot sticker.  Lastly, there was very little 'soup' or yummy juices inside. \n\nHaving lived and worked in China and visited Shanghai a dozen times, I can say that the Shanghainese really do make some kick-ass dumplings.  These were not.  The mark of a great dumpling are great tasting filling (these were admittedly pretty good), super thin wrapper (because it's all about the filling), and a rich, belly-warming juice inside each dumpling.  Kingdom's dumplings only had one out of the three which makes them only mediocre.  \n\nIt's really too bad.  I hate flying 12 hours to get great dumplings.

They were thin, crispy brown, and chewy. I wanted MORE!!!! \n\nWe also had the lamb skewers which you should all try. Very flavorful and not burnt unlike other places I've been to. The tofu noodles were very refreshing. \n\nI really enjoyed my time here. I was getting pretty full but I just wanted to order more onion pancakes and xiao long baos and stuff my face! \n\nThe service wasn't too bad, though they did take forever to refill the teapot even though there were only one other table in such a small area. But besides that, I really enjoyed my time there. Very quiet and chill place to be with family or friends. \n\nUntil next time tasty dumplings.", "author": "Eliza B."}

Well, for one, you don't accidentally burn your pan-fried dumpling like someone I know (me). Kingdom of Dumpling is one of those surprises that you find in a hole. It's a small establishment, but it serves up an array of different types of dumplings and some interesting items you don't really expect. Dinner entrees and dim sum to name the least. \n\nMy fiancee and I decided to give it a try despite my reluctance to pay someone else to cook my dumplings. We ordered the usual fare of Xiao Long Bao (Shanghai Dumplings; or directly translated as Little Dragon Dumpling), Pan-Fried Pork and Chives Dumplings and a Beef Stew Noodle. The Xiao Long Bao came in half a dozen and it was simple, yet awesome! It doesn't have a whole lot of soup in it like the ones from Shanghai Dumplings on Balboa, but it was enough to hit the spot. Doesn't burst out to burn you either, so that's good if you're really hungry. \n\nThe Pan-Fried Dumplings were exactly the ones that you get from the restaurants parent company (I think) on Noriega and it's the same dumpling that I felt in love with. The pan-fried part of these dumplings weren't how I would like it: slightly burnt and crunchy. Instead, it was barely browned at the bottom. No crunch, but it's still good.\n\nThe Beef Stew Noodle has to be one of the best I had. The beef was soft and juicy, the broth was great and the noodles (flat rice noodles) were not overcooked. Good pick!\n\nThis is quite a surprise to see another hole-in-the-wall restaurant stand up against the other bigger restaurants. The interior decor is actually quite...modern...if I can say that. Service is basic, but the food is the focus. Don't expect to be treated like royalty, but just go and enjoy some good old fashion dumplings!", "author": "Jeremy L."}

The restaurant itself isn't large or dressed-up - it has maybe 6 tables at most and a mostly unadorned interior. But damn, these are the best soup dumplings I've had a chance to bite into. The one thing that soup dumplings in San Francisco have a clear advantage over those I've eaten in New York is that the skins are not as thick, and the size of the dumplings make it much easier to eat. We ordered 3 crates, and it was worth every bite. Unlike Yank Sing, where we occasionally got one with barely any pork or all pork and no soup, these had the perfect ratio and were amazingly delicious. We also ordered a platter of pork and shrimp dumplings, which were just as equally outstanding compared to dumplings I've eaten elsewhere. It was too bad it was our last day, because I would have been back for more for sure. The price is very reasonable (I think it was $5 for a crate of 6), and the lady serving us was very hospitable.\n\nThis may be quite a ways from Chinatown, but if you want good dumplings - be they xiao long bao or any other dumplings - you HAVE to come here. Out of the many, many Chinese restaurants I've eaten at, these were the best, by far. A must-eat!", "author": "Asuka N."}

I believe the manager? was constantly scanning the room the entire time offering his friendly service to everyone in need.

I didn't taste any XO at all.  \n\nI wouldn't get the beef noodle soup again.  Not a very rich broth and the noodles were overcooked.  \n\nThe green onion pancakes are different from the doughy flaky chewy layers I'm use to.

The dishes themselves are all pretty small (i.e. 6 small xlb in the order as opposed to 8 larger ones at other places), and they are cheap (our total bill was only $10/ea), so if it looks crowded you may want to order more dishes than you normally would just to be safe.", "author": "Michael C."}

The art of getting the perfect bite out of you soup dumpling is to pick it up at the tip and place it on your soup spoon without breaking the skin and losing the soup. Bite the tip off first to cool it down a bit so you don't burn your mouth. Dab a little vinegar sauce and ginger if you like, and enjoy.

If I hadn't listened to the hype I would have come here on my own not expected the world and then probably would have enjoyed myself so much more and then given this place a better Yelp review because I would have liked it alot more. \n\nBut I came with the preconceived notion that the dumplings were the best I was ever going to have. And they were definitely not, sad to say. \n\nFirst off this is a cute little hole in the wall and it's two blocks from my house. For that reason alone, you know I'll be back, despite this first let down. \n\nBut anyway, back to the broken heart I'm suffering. The dumplings! The dumplings, this is a dumpling house after all, right? Sorry, there was barely any flavor in them. And the little \"squirt\" dumplings are known for? Barely any in these. And the different kinds: pork, beef and the other ones- they tasted the same. I mean, a dumpling is a dumpling, we still ate them all, but to be honest, the mass produced, overpriced ones at Yank Sing tasted better. \n\nThe beef onion pancake, was what I imagine this restaurant sees as their answer to a quesadilla, in that it's flat, stuffed with meet and something holding it together, (couldn't decipher it) and it's cut like a quesadilla if that helps you envision it visually. But either way, it tasted good. \n\nPot stickers, were perfectly cooked crispy on the outside and warm on the inside. \n\nChow fun was delicious. \n\nService was pretty attentive once you got the girl's attention. With only 7 tables in there ( yes I counted) they only had 1 server and she seemed to be flustered, maybe everyone sat and ordered at the same time and it was getting to her. But either way, though the wait between dishes was a bit long, once you got her attention she was great. \n\nWould I come back? Yes. Would I come back soley again for the dumplings? No way. I would come back though because I was too lazy to drive anywhere else, and because I was crazing greasy Chinese good, and because I'm not a huge crazy dumpling fan and can live with or without these anyway and eat something else on the menu that is better. \n\nIt's just sad when you advertise a \"KINGDOM\" of anything and that one specialty you have, it's just not so good. \n\nAgain, had not ever heard of the place this review would have gotten a star and a half more. And yes I'll be back because the food is decent and pretty good, and it's close to home. But again, I was so jaded by my preconceived notions I could only get let down by this review. So I ask those reading it to please when you dine somewhere or go see or meet someone, even if you have a preconceived notion of the place or person, which most of the time you can't avoid, as everyone does this, and we all judge others without the facts, can you please try and at least try to keep yourself on track to remaining impartial?

I'm always down for a good dumpling fest and this place definitely hits the spot.  I fantasize about the juicy goodness soup bursting in my mouth as I puncture the delicate dumpling skin, Ahhh......it is just toooooOoooo satisfying! I like the dumplings here, its so much leaner and tastes less fattier than other places.  You'll know what I mean when you've had clumpy globs of lard in your dumpling.  Definitely coming back here and not recommending it to anyone", "author": "Shirley H."}

I think a switch should be in session haha.  Well, ultimately I would say 'Kingdom of Dumpling' IS still better.\n\nPros: Their dumplings are amazing in the sense of both quality and quantity. You really get your bang for your buck here. I've tried their assorted dumplings, curry fish balls, shaow lung bao, beef pancakes, string beans and they were all very delicious. Their Tai tea was also very thirst quenching and a sizable amount! Most importantly, I didn't feel parched after the meal! This can only mean little to no MSG and a reasonable amount of sodium. \n\nTheir service was also exceptionally well. The owner and staff were all very polite, friendly and approachable. \n\nCons: I'm very content with this place and am a fan, but grading objectively, I would have to say that the flaws include:\n \n1) Shaow Lung Bao being a bit dry / not enough pork juice/broth within \n* This problem is fixed! 3/12/2013 \n\n2) Small place to accommodate a lot of hungry people. Atmosphere could use a little work as well. \n\nDo note that there is another branch opened by the same owner on Irving street Between 20 and 21st.

I saw this place on yelp last week so I decided to give it a go. We got there at around 5:30pm. Unfortunately the place only felt a little cleaner than SDK. The waitress lady was busy prepping green beans at one of the tables as we walked in. She spoke no English whatsoever but I took it as a good sign. The food had to be legit right?\n\nDuck Curry Stew with Rice - This was one of their whiteboard specials. I'm happy they gave the option of brown rice. The curry didn't have a milk/coconut milk in it like I'm used to at Indian/Thai places but it tasted just as creamy! The duck meat was simply delicious: sweet, tender, and savory. I couldn't stop picking all the pieces out of the curry! This dish also came with big cubes of flavorful eggplant and zucchini. \n\nShanghai Soup Dumplings - These were disappointing. For $4.95 you get six dumplings. Not only is it lacking in quantity but I found the meat inside to be lacking in flavor. Which is worse? Taste for sure! I'm used to a big burst of meaty flavor swimming in broth but I didn't find it here. There wasn't even enough soup in each dumpling. \n\nPan Fried Shanghai Dumplings - Again, lacking. I had one and let my bf eat the remaining three.\n\nBoiled Chicken and Corn Dumplings - I liked their boiled dumplings better than the steamed ones. The corn was very sweet and chicken was mixed it well with the filling. I didn't want to eat them all but I couldn't resist!\n\nBoiled Pork and Napa Cabbage Dumplings - I love pork dumplings and flavor wise these didn't disappoint. I just wish the boiled dumplings were bigger.\n\nThe real verdict is 3.5 stars. But I think it could really sway from 3 to 4 stars depending on what you order.

That employee (who never shut the door), a customer paying for takeout, a customer waiting for takeout, a customer leaving with takeout, a customer peeking in to see how full the room is, a customer pressed against the wall waiting for a seat. \n\nService was poor and the dishes came out hodge podge. They don't coordinate the dishes together so we got our soup last and it was pretty cold. We had to ask for water 4 times.

My party of 2 dined on 2 types of boiled dumplings (pork + chive, beef + carrot), steamed soup dumplings (a.k.a. xiao long bao), panfried chive pockets, and a cold tofu noodle salad.  The boiled dumplings were delicious, fresh and moist, just simple clean healthy good food.  They were made with great care, skill, and pride.  The meats were lean, the handmade dough pleasantly textured.  The xlbs were good as well.  The filling was a bit porkier tasting than I preferred, but the soup was a generous mouthful, and the whole thing together was quite yummy.  I recall wanting more after wolfing down my share of 3.  The chive pockets and the tofu noodle were fine.

They tasted good at the first bite but the taste doesn't exactly last. I would have liked the pancake to be just a little crispier even though I usually prefer soft foods. The pork and shrimp dumplings were good. I was glad it wasn't soupy because i didn't end up with a burned tongue surprise. The soy milk was not as sweet as I would have liked but it was light and just right. It was great with the chinese doughnut. The XO beef chowfun was also good but a little oily.

I don't think the owner is too used to running a restaurant yet, but he's friendly and tries to please (read: service is slow but friendly).  PS, the owner is David's brother, and he's from hebei province--the province right around beijing.  He's also the owner of the Asian American Food Company at Noriega, which is why the dumplings might seem familiar to you. \n\nNote they use the correct gluten content for their dumplings, unlike santung which is just plain wrong. \n\nItem-by-item review\n1) xiao long tang bao (shanghai soup dumplings).  Actually not bad!  There was actually soup inside!  skin was thick, but forgivable given the soup.  I give it a B, maybe B+.  NO cheating here, like dumpling king.  Tasty meat inside, straight-up.  He gives you vinegar, but no ginger strands?  weird.  This is one of the better ones I've had in the city.\n\n2) shrimp and chive dumplings.  We actually ordered the pork, shrimp, and chive dumplings, but he gave us these by accident :\\.  No big deal.  needed more substance inside--aka shrimp.  or pork.  but it was still tasty.\n\n3) lamb dumplings (+beef soup).  damn these were tasty.  I asked him to put it in their beef soup and he did (I expected the brown hong shao niu rou tang). Which was one of the best \"clear\" type beef soups I've had in the whole bay area.  Super peppery, and very flavorful.  I'd go back again just for  beef noodle soup.\n\n3) chive boxes (jiu cai he zi)!  Yesss!!  finally a place with chive boxes in the city!  one of my favorite northern dimsum, this is basically a huge semi-flattened pan-fried dumpling with no meat inside, just chives, eggs, glass noodles, maybe some little dried shrimp.  So good.  And it was pan fried and not the lame deep fried style.\n\n4) beef pancakes (niu rou xian bing).  I actually expected this to be the beijing style \"hockey-puck\" type dimsum (like A&J and Darda have), but it ended up being halfway between that type and the really flat one they have at old mandarin.  I much prefer the hockey-puck style that has soup inside, but ah well.  It was still tasty, and I think better than Old Mandarin's which is too greasy for me.\n\n5) shredded daikon pastries (luo buo si bing).  TASTY!  these had little chunks of ham in the shreds inside, and was moist.  Usually this pastry is too dry because of the flaky pastry around the daikon.  But they got the balance here.  I was very impressed!  Baked and not too greasy, I always feel good after eating these.\n\n6) potstickers.  These were sealed, unlike what I'm used to from most northern places (which is usually just folded in half with the meat exposed to keep it dry).  But it was still good, since there was soup inside!  definitely better than the stuff the cantonese folk make in most places in SF.\n\n7) the owner made a creme brulee for us, which he boasted was made from real vanilla beans.  He blowtorched outside of the kitchen as a show, and handed it to me.  tasty, but I've had better.  for 3.95, it's not so bad though.\n\nI'll be back for some beef noodles.  And some of the other snacks for sure.  The green onion pancakes looked quite good.  They were pan-fried and looked layered like they should be.\n\nThe food was very tasty--I now have a new go-to spot for chinese \"flour food\" in SF!", "author": "Fong L."}

The noodle dishes are not that great, it doesn't have a lot of noodles. The fried tofu is not spicy (I'm not sure if it's suppose to be, but judging from it's Chinese name, it should be).

The health score shows 96 but my friend and I were wondering if they tampered with the 9 where it should've been a 0.  Told the owner Lee, that we came here because of Yelp.

All sides of this tiny sunset hole-in-the wall advertise these claims and as I was waiting for my order most recently, I confirmed the honor. \n\n   This is a no frills dumpling house. It's tiny and usually a bit crowded but the people eating there are there for a good reason. They serve the best Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings, which I will refer to as XLB from now on) I've had in the bay area. The XLB are perfectly cooked with just the right thickness of skin meat:broth ratio. I could eat at least three orders of these on my own. They are simply fantastic.\n    Also not to be missed is the beef chow fun. The noodles taste fresh and the sauce is not as greasy as it might typically be. The chow fun also pairs very nicely with their spicy chili sauce that they have out on each table. \nThere traditional dumplings are served in many different varieties. One can get pork, beef and carrot, shrimp and a few other combinations. I've tried the shrimp and the beef/carrot and they were both excellent. The potstickers are another item that you should try. I don't usually eat potstickers because I'm not a fan of such thick skin on dumplings but these were very good. \nThe food overall is very good. I am willing to come back again and again for all of these tasty dumplings.\nWe did have a bit of an issue with service though on my first visit here with my parents. My parents have their own bamboo baskets to steam things (like XLB) so my mom wanted a (frozen) order to go. The owner brought out a cooked order to go and argued with my mom for way too long over a $6 order of dumplings. At one point my mom said, \"you keep my money and the dumplings and the next time I come you can give me the frozen ones,\" since by now they said they didn't have any frozen XLB available. With this the owner retorted, \"well who's gonna pay for these?\" Needless to say I was really put off with this. I was surprised a restaurant owner would argue at such lengths over an order of dumplings and what seemed to be a simple misunderstanding. Only after my mother had completely given up did they bring out a pink Chinese bag full of the dumplings (not even wrapped they were just thrown in there).\nI will mention that I came back the following weekend with a friend and the service was great, but that initial experience was just not great. \n\nHopefully your first experience will be more like my second and whatever you do, don't try to order ANYTHING to go!", "author": "Egan B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-10-17", "description": "One of my dreams has come true.  I love the dumplings at Kingdom of Dumpling/Asian American Food Company on Noreiga.  I suggested to them that they should open up a restaurant, since some people, like me, are lazy and want cooked dumplings.  Well, they did it!  They took over David's Kitchen on Taraval (though they may have kept David's menu - I'm not sure since I never went to David's Kitchen).  You can get their dumplings there, as well as dim sum (e.g., various Chinese pancakes), noodle soups and more.  \n\nRight now there's one server and he's nice but service is slow.  It takes a long time for the tables to be cleared.  Hopefully, they'll get faster with time.  It's a small place with 10 tables and only one tiny stove.  I wouldn't come here with a large group.\n\nI ordered dumpling soup (pork with cabbage) with wide rice noodles, to go (they didn't include utensils).  I knew the dumplings would be great , very juicy and flavorful, with thicker skins (handmade by Chinese women).  There weren't enough of them but it was a delicious bowl of noodle soup.  The broth was very light.  The rice noodles tasted fresh.  It came with thinly sliced shitake mushrooms and bok choy.  \n\nI hope they can improve the service and thrive in this spot.  Dumplings + creme brulee at the same restaurant?  Works for me.\n\nUpdate:  The lamb and pork dumplings are better than the chicken ones.  The onion pancake tastes like mum's but thinner.  It's not oily and has a nice crispy exterior.  Could use a little more salt and I hardly ever say that.  The beef tendon noodle soup has tasty broth and quality cuts of tender beef but we didn't like the noodle that it came with (some wheat noodle that was too soft).  XLBs are good - quite juicy, could use some more salt too.", "author": "Lolia S."}

Kind of bullshit, you don't go make the food right when I say something, I wanted to cancel the order and just go but you made us stay for that crap which wasn't that good. The lamb skewers were over seasoned and too peppery, not moist. The chow mein was standard but I would have liked to have it accompany the whole meal which it did no so we were too full to eat any of it when it finally arrived. But even if we still had room it was forgetable. The dumplings were also not that good. They feel apart easily and were hastily made it seemed. The taste was okay but their sauce was overly vinegary to the point where it was almost unedible. I've had better dumplings at other places in sf to be honest. Just the mix of service which was lacking considering it was such a small place and they had more than enough employees working to cover it, the kitchen not being organized to send out food for tables and the lackluster taste of the dumplings when we got them.

The noodle wasn't overcooked but i would prefer if they offered Slice Noodle (Dao Hsiao Mien) or maybe even thick noodles that had more bouncy when you bite on it. As for the Meat part, it was nice and juicy. In most places, the beef would taste like overcooked dead chicken meat, or similar to paper shreds. This was not the case if you order Beef Noodle Soup @ KOD. \n\nMost importantly, i must talk about my favorite Lamb Dumplings. I drove here specifically to have this again.

Hey at least if his business doesn't end up working out, it won't be from lack of trying that's for sure.\n\nOn to the food:\nLamb skewers- Very flavorful and zesty; no wild smell and couldn't even\n                             tell it was lamb\nPork/Cabbage Dumpling- Doughy, but big, fresh, and juicy\nChicken/Chives Dumpling- Doughy too, but very tasty and sweet\nBeef Stew Noodle Soup- A bit on the small side, but flavors were there\nBeef Onion Pancake- Perfection\n\nOverall I was pretty impressed with this place. With over 20 different kinds of dumplings to select from, it truly is the Kingdom of Dumpling. The restaurant itself is a bit small and dirty, kind of reminds me of an in-law unit. It was also a bit surprising to see a bunch of chipped plates and dishes considering grand opening was not too long ago. Nevertheless, though, I would not hesitate to come back.", "author": "jeff c."}

They give you dark vinegar dipping sauce which is a delicious pair. The other dish that is good is the pork/shrimp chive dumplings. \n\nThe service you get is is not bad, but isn't great.

It was not easy getting here but I'm glad hubby got around various traffic hot spots so that I won't be disapponted - yes, my hubby is a keeper.\n\nDrove around only once and found a space just one block away.  A true hole in the wall - there are only 10 tables of 2.  Lucky for us, a table just left before we walked in so we just waited for them to clear the table before settling down.  While waiting, we saw all the goodies other patrons are eating...\n\nThere are some specials on the white board - duck breast, curry lamb, red snapper...huh?  After dinner, the owner told us he was keeping the previous owner's menu but most people come for their dumplings, as they should!\n\nAnyway, there is a one page breakfast and snack menu on the table under the glass top.  We were also given a 1 page front/back menu that were categorized by dim sum (appetizers), dumplings - the most assortment I've seen, soup noodles, fried rice/chow fun/chow mein, dessert.\n\nAfter much debate, we decided on:\npork elbow (suggested by owner) - $5.95 - thinly sliced pork elbow with skin over a bed of spring mix served with a plate of soy vinegar with garlic - very tasty and perfect consistency, skin was chewy while meat was tender. \n\npork and chinese spinach dumpling - yum, love the skin!  filling was tasty and love the juice.\n\ntendon noodle soup - nice broth, lots of tender tendon, some thick shitake mushroom slices, Shanghai bok choi and some chewy homemade noodles.\n\nxlb - smaller but tasty.  \n\npan fried shredded turnip pastry - it's totally not what I had in mind, i thought it was more like turnip cake.  the filling was good but i really don't like the pastry shell so hubby cleaned this plate\n\nI'm certain they make their own chili sauce - the color is light orange - it was tasty, like a mix of sriracha with garlic paste or something.  \n\nThey also carry a decent selection of bottled beer - Anchor Steam, Tsing Tao, Sapporo, Heineken, Sin Ha, Bud? \n\nThe owner took our order and came out to talk to us when we were done.  Asked if we enjoyed our meal.  Told us the dumplings are homemade.  Asked us how we know about them - told him Yelp.  He suggested we try the breakfast items next time as they serve it all day!\n\nThe younger waiter is not very attentive nor quick but I guess you don't come for the service but the food.\n\nA wonderful evening that filled our stomachs, all at $36 - can't complain.", "author": "Gloria H."}

OH MY GOD... The meat! Um.... Is it just me, or could this also be an advertisement for a sex toy? \n\nAnyways... MOVING ON! \n\nJoe's Shanghai will forever be my favorite, but since they have yet to open a location in San Francisco, Kingdom of Dumpling is now my go to place for yummy xlb. The interior isn't nothing to get excited over and they crammed as many tables as possible in such a small space. Don't be surprised if you end up having to share a table with someone either. The service is actually very good for an asian place and the waiter is pretty funny. At one point he walked over to my table, asked how everything was then said to me while making a hand to mouth gesture in my direction \"smooth. very smooth\", but since he has a very thick accent, it sounded more like \"smooooooooze. beri beri smoooooooze.\" I thought he was talking about the dumplings so I agreed, yep, they are very smooth and yummy! Later my boyfriend corrected me and said \"I think he was talking about the way you use your chopsticks...\" Ooooook... Funny guy. \n\nWe had one order of xlb (6 for $4.95), one order of pork and chive dumplings which I think came about 12 to an order and cold wide noodle which tastes EXACTLY like the cold jellyfish dish, but is just really good cold noodles.

So why just 3 star?  \n\nLet's go over the food and how each one was:\n1) We ordered the pork and shrimp dumpling - very good; tasted fresh, not over seasoned, not oily (alot of places make juicy dumplings that are caused by the addition of lots of fat and these dumplings weren't like that at all).  Would order it again and maybe try a different flavor dumpling next time.\n\n2) Baked turnip cakes - very flaky; not overseasoned; would order it again; menu said there are 2 cakes, but 3 came out.  Not sure if they just adjusted the order to 3 cuz we had 3 people or if they charged me extra.  (They didn't itemize the bill, which was not very good and we had to guess if the amount was around what we'd expect.)\n\n3) Cold wide bean noodles - average; over powering taste of wasabi and raw garlic was not minced fine enough, but an interesting dish that is refreshing on a hot day; probably won't order it again\n\n4) Chicken and spinach wonton in wide noodle soup - wontons were very good; the noodles were slighlty below average; i would order wontons again w/out the noodles next time\n\n5) Pancakes stuffed with chives, egg, pork - very good, not greasy, very fresh, not overseasoned; would order it again\n\nOverall: All the dishes came out piping hot which is very important!\nHere's the things I didn't like that resulted in the 3 stars:\n\n1) The place is small and we just had 3 people which required moving tables together already.  Most people who came here are more than parties of 2 and they had 7 tables set up for parties of 2 and 1 table that can seat 6 to 7 people.  At a point during our meal, they had to bring folding chairs for the bigger party which to me seems not very professional to have to sit on folding chairs\n\n2) As a result of being a small place and there were customers waiting, we were rushed out with a check.  Granted they apologized for rushing us out, I don't like feeling rushed out.\n\n3) The place didn't feel extremely clean.  There were spots on the chopstick holder.\n\nTotal bill $37 including tips and tax already.  Not overly expensive for lunch for 3 people.\n\nThis restaurant has more of a hole in the wall feel, family runned, and feels like good comfort food.

Pretty simplistic menu with a dumpling galore section. 16 different steamed dumplings (can be ordered pan fried, written in Chinese on the menu).\n\nWe tried:\nXiao lung bao - \n2 orders, each order comes with 6 pieces. Meat filling was too lean I thought, could use a bit of fat for better texture. Juice inside doesn't have the usual depth of soup flavor that the better ones have. Skin was thin, chewy in the good way, and had enough tension to hold the soup in without breaking while being held up by a pair of chopsticks. And for some magical reason, none of the bao stuck to each other . . . they might have brushed the baos lightly with some shortening. They were a joy to handle.\n\nChicken and corn steamed dumplings\n- Pretty good. Good for my mate who doesn't like eating mammals.\n\nChives and Shrimp steamed dumplings\n- I liked this one better than the chicken and corn one. It's approaching San Tung's\n\nGrilled skewered marinated lamb\n- This one for me was the experience defining dish. It was heavily marinated with a thick layer of black pepper coating. YUMMIE! I loved it! There's even some fat attached to the lamb meat.\n\nChives Pancakes\n- Standard fare, not the best, not the worst.\n\nService was pretty attentive. The Chinese dude was very friendly but he was also on his cell phone 50% of the time. I wasn't bothered by it. Check was $40+ for two but we do eat like pigs. $4.95 for 6 xiao lung bao was also approaching Shanghai 1930's $10 for 8. Shanghai 1930's XLBs are the best so far, in the city.\n\nSome of you are raving about the xiao lung bao at Yank Sing but I wouldn't even call'em xiao lung bao when they serve'em with RED VINEGAR!!!!!

I grew up in a small town in the Southeast and never really had Chinese food before. I've had fried rice and spring rolls and sweet and sour chicken, but I didn't know that all that wasn't REAL Chinese. I've really been missing out. The Xiao Long Bao was AMAZING.

I wasn't surprised the owner at the restaurant was pushing them.\n\nThe only bad thing - and it's a small thing unworthy of any deductions in stars - is the length of wait between dishes.

Its everything that past Yelpers proclaim that it is: a hole in the wall with great service and good eats.  However, everything just began to taste the same.  \n\nFirst off, my friend and I ordered WAY too much food.  We ordered the Shanghai soup dumplings (6), Shanghai fried soup dumplings (4), bamboo shoots, green onion pancake (1), sweet soy milk and the corn and pork dumplings (12).  We weren't even going to order the corn and pork dumplings, but one of the waiters insisted we order one of their special dumplings...how could we resist the charming limited English speaking man?  The food came in waves, which worked out alright...  \n\nHere's the verdict:\n- Shanghai soup dumplings:  My fave out of the bunch!  Best when enjoyed pipping hot, and you use your Asian soup spoon to catch the soup that comes out with every bite.  Didn't need the soy sauce vinegar, ginger concoction to flavor.\n\n-Shanghai fried soup dumplings:  My least fave of the 3 types of dumplings we ordered.  The casing was too bao like and the filling less dynamic and less soupy than the non-fried counterpart.\n\n- Bamboo shoots: Nicely sauteed or tossed w soy sauce, scallions, ginger and garlic (the last two are my guesses).  Tasty and served as a cold appetizer.  It's a huge portion; a huge heaping mound on a small plate.\n\n- Green onion pancake: Pretty standard, nothing to sing home about.  It's definitely more oily and well fried than doughy.\n\n-Sweet soy milk: Standard, and wasn't actually served very warm.  I bet it's warm and fresh in the AM. \n\n- Corn and pork dumplings: By the time these came out we were getting stuffed from the aforementioned goodies.  We ate maybe 2 each.  These definitely tasted best w/ the soy sauce concoction.  I wish we ordered one w/ leeks or something cause the corn is not a good pork dumpling compliment.\n\nIf I wasn't so packed in and almost inside the kitchen area...I would give them the final .5 to make 4 stars.

Although we were promptly seated when we arrived at 7, just 15 minutes later, a line formed out the door. Our waiter was not necessarily rude but very curt...just like in Shanghai! Unfortunately the food wasn't as authentic as I had hoped it to be. We started off with the cold beef tendon appetizer which was really unpleasantly salty. I do NOT recommend it. Next came the fried chive pockets (?) or jiu cai he zi. This, while pretty greasy, was actually surprisingly good especially because it came out hot and fresh. I was really looking forward to the fried dumplings or sheng jian bao but instead of being filled with juicy goodness, the insides were dry while the outer buns were soggy. Weird, right? The waiter brought out our two baskets of xiao long bao last.

But then most of the time you need to know exactly where ur eating. I feel like if you were to by pass this place and dont know that it hand makes the best dumplings in town you wont even give a chance by looking at their menu. Let me say this is my 4th time trying good chines food and it is the best. I find  it very strange that it has a yellowish 3.5 stars on yelp. It deserves a solid 4 starts. I think the only thing ppl might not like is the small place but I found it not a big of a problem because it feels like its part of the experience. You want food that takes to another place makes you feel the taste of that culture that moment really really makes a difference and I think this place done a good job doing so.

In fact, there was so much brown greasy residue on the damn things that it looked like they used them to clean out the grease traps.  The carpets reeked this indescribable smell, something between homeless-scalp and gymsocks that have been reworn for weeks - then dipped in turpentine.  \n\nThe lady who served us was nice, but she spoke only in Cantonese (possibly).  So of course my wonton soup that came out (like 45 min later) was the wrong thing.  Oh well, I didn't really care, since I was so hungry.  I took my first sip.\n\nGAH.  The soup was essentially just hot water with hints of salt and sulfur with few wonton floating limply at the surface along with a couple ribbons of green onion.  I had about two sips (the second sip was just to make sure this was a gross as I thought it was).  \n\nI bit into the soggy wonton next.  The casing dough was super thick and soggy, and had no textural bite at all, in fact it just sort of disintegrated in my mouth.  Note the distinction between \"disintegrate\" and \"melt\" - kobe beef melts in your mouth, while, say, toilet paper disintegrates.  This was on the toilet paper side of the spectrum.\n\nThe wonton's filling was almost depressing.  It was as if I was a guest in a farming family's home (who had fallen upon bad times), who tried to make wonton but only had old vegetables and weeds to fill them with.  I immediately thought of this while I was biting into this pitiful dumpling and just couldn't take it anymore.  As soon as my girlfriend was done with her 4 or 5 sips, we just left a twenty, which was way more than what the meal actually cost, and shot out of there.\n\nYikes.  But at least I didn't get sick, I'll give them credit for that, definitely.", "author": "Thomas M."}

I was a bit skeptical because I've tried a lot of dumplings in the bay area and never been completely satisfied with the results. My mom makes some of the best dumplings from scratch so that's probably one of the reasons why I'm so picky with my dumplings. \n\nAfter reading the reviews on yelp, we had to get xiao long bao and we were not disappointed. It's top 5 xiao long bao's I've ever tasted and I've had some good ones in Taiwan.  It was pretty hot so careful when you bite in or a burst of hot soup might burn you. The top part had a very thick piece of dough, which was kind of a disappointment. I guess if you ate the whole thing at one time you wouldn't notice. We also ordered the pork dumplings with corn, shrimp with chives, pork dumplings with green beans, green onion pancake, beef tendon noodle soup and the marinated cucumber salad which was a special not on the menu. The cucumber salad was pretty standard but I love having this dish with dumplings. They give you a pretty good amount (we got a bigger plate than the one pictured), not like other restaurants that only provide a small plate. It wasn't marinated long enough for my tastes though. The pork dumplings with corn was probably the best out of the 3 types we had. It had a little bit of sweetness to it and it was very tender. The pork and green beans were also very good. The green beans were a nice addition and added some great texture to the dumplings. I'm not a huge chives fan so I did not enjoy the shrimp and chives. It did not include very much shrimp and a whole lot of chives. The green onion pancake was not that good and for the price, I expected something heavenly.  It was pretty thin, not that crispy and pretty bland.  I wouldn't order it again.  Finally, the beef tendon noodle soup was pretty good. The soup wasn't salty but had some good flavor. The tendons were melt in your mouth delicious and the noodles were very fresh. I definitely want to go back and try their beef noodle soup and other types of dumplings.", "author": "Ken W."}

Don't change a thing.\nGreen onion pancake: I never say no to G.O. pancakes so I was happy to find that these were crispy and oily as they should be, though a little under-seasoned.\nPanfried dumplings, pork/leek and chicken/napa shui jiao: on par with the best.\nXiao long bao: I have never understood the fascination that everyone seems to have with these tiny morsels of dough and meat...but they were as good as any I've had.\nDipping sauce: the perfect ratio of ginger to vinegar to soy sauce.  They give it to you pre-made in little dishes, presumably so you won't ruin the delicate balance of flavors with your ham-fisted sloshing.  Not to worry though; if you guzzle it down (it's just that good) they'll give you more on request.\n\nOverall:\nHearty northern-style comfort food.

Loved the ridiculous habanero hot sauce, and the red wine vinegar (with a touch of sugar) which goes incredibly well to cut the heaviness.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-02-28", "description": "I've had dump(r)ings far and wide.  My mother and grand mother, of course made the best. ;-)  However, in my quest for the way \"mom used to make\" dumplings has at least for the time being ceased with the discovery of Kingdom of Dumplings.  Arguably, I find non-Catonese regional type Chinese cuisine best outside of San Francisco, sadly.  With the high ratio of Asian-Chinese in San Francisco, one would think that the caliber of Chinese food would rank very high here.  IMHO, not true.  A few really good Cantonese do exist here, but I get burnt out on this regional style pretty quickly and am left with few other choices.  Since my family originally came from the north, I had the chance to often experience those great regional dishes during family pow-wows while I was growing up.  Unfortunately these non-Cantonese dishes are tough to find outside of family get togethers, of any note anyways, in the Bay Area. \n\nKingdom of Dumplings' first, foremost, and most important aspect is simply the food.  The space itself is small, often crowded, and if you are unlucky enough to sit by the door during a cool or cold day, you'll get a blast of the weather in your back if seated there.  Its about a 5-6 out of 10 in the upkeep department, BUT back to the food.  Of the half dozen or so restaurants in SF that I've tried which offer dumplings, any of them are a distant runner up to Kingdom of Dumplings.\n\n\n\n1) The wrappers are fresh and thicker than \"store bought\".  Think of fresh made pasta over boxed, or even frozen.  That subtle difference adds to the higher standard and finesse of the dumplings here.\n\n\n2) The fillings from chicken to pork and even lamb are just the right balance to the wrapper.  The ground meat is the right coarseness, not so minced, pasty, or under volume like some of the other dumpling houses in the City.  The supporting ingredients like green beans, cabbage, chives, and even corn illustrate the wider variety offered here.  Along with the \"classic\" filling combos,  I tried the chicken with corn filling dumplings for the first time there and was surprised at how good there were.\n\n\n3) They are boiled for just the right amount of time so they are not under or over cooked.\n\n\n4) The numerous side dishes are also well prepared, fresh, of good portions , and are competent co-stars.  Try some of the tofu based cold side plates.  The garnishes of cilantro, sesame oil and other ingredients are a tasty mix.  The green onion pancakes(like a Chinese flat bread, similar in some ways to paratha) here are the most home style in preparation I've had.  Most places that even offer this side dish over fry if not seemingly \"deep fry\" them into over greasy crackers.  Perhaps an over white-ification take on this classic dish.\n\n\n\nI did try a few of the soup noodle dishes and this would not necessarily be my first Chinese noodle place to go to(the best non-Caontese style I've had is actually in Irvine, CA), but there were very good, just not as stellar as the dumplings.  I have not tried the wonton soups there and will give those a try the next time out there.\n\nThe star dish of many dumpling houses is the \"Shanghai Soup\" style or \"Xiaolongbao\".  Outside of Ding Tai Feng(dumplings extraordinaire!) in Shanghai itself, these were the best I think I've had in CA.  For instance, the ones served at the restaurant out on Balboa pale in comparison.\n\nThe beer is served nice and cold, the owner who seems to be the point man server was polite and moved quickly to get dishes to his guests.    When we left on the 2 occasions we've been there, he was courteous, polite and grateful.\n\nWe are big fans of this place.  I would say one of the dangers is coming too often and getting burnt out on dumplings, but save this joint for those meals when you want Chinese, something a bit out of the ordinary and very nicely done.\n\nBTW, they offer flash frozen dumplings to take home and cook up fresh yourself.  We haven't tried these yet, but will see how the cook up soon.\n\n\"My kingdom for a dumpling\"  call to arms has been found at \"Kingdom of Dumplings\".  Really good place.  If you're looking for this style of Chinese food in SF, this is pretty much THE joint.", "author": "Patrick M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-08-08", "description": "After hearing about Kingdom of Dumpling for years my partner and I finally made a visit recently. We were rewarded with parking right out front but there were at least 20 people waiting on the sidewalk at 7PM on a Tuesday evening.  Even in Summer the weather out in the avenues was cold and blustery as the fog set in, however, after signing in at the list by the door,  it wasn't much of a hassle waiting in the comfort of our car.   From what we heard from both the folks waiting patiently on the sidewalk and from the wait staff, there is always a line to get in.  The reason?  The restaurant is quite small, perhaps 10 - 12 tables and that resulted in a hour long wait.  Previous posters who called it a hole in the wall are spot on, there is nothing at all fancy about the place. It wouldn't be mistaken for Yank Sing.   When they called our name we entered and were met by a rush of steam, so much that my glasses steamed up.  What a contrast to the chilly summer air ~ !  Once we were inside eating we could see just why this place is considered to be the best dumpling place in San Francisco. The food was sensational in very respect, served fresh and steaming.  As this was our first time here, the waiter made some suggestions which proved to be excellent.  The saut\u00e9ed green beans and the cucumber dish were to die for.  The beans were hot, spicy and crispy, and the cucumbers were sliced cold, in a briny sauce, and it was a wonderful.  The hot sauce condiment on our table was also unique and fiery hot. The pork and shrimp dumplings were a huge portion, maybe 15 dumplings, the soup dumplings were suburb, and the onion cakes were among the best we've ever had. a throwback to the legendary Shem's in Albany in the East Bay where we were first introduced to them in the late 1970's.  The pot stickers were also very good.  I think the reason why all of these dishes were so good, is because they are freshly made.  The pot stickers, in particular, tasted as if they were created right before they arrived at our table. \n\n\nBe prepared to wait.  I quickly learned the ritual that fans of this place use which is to sign in before you park your car, and if you visit before the evening check out the cool shops that line the neighborhood.  I realize that some folks might be turned off by the hole in the wall atmosphere.  But this is what gives Kingdom of Dumplings it's charm.  It's an authentic San Francisco joint as the line of patrons waiting to get in as we left surly confirms.  It is definitely worth the wait and you'll be rewarded with the best dumplings in San Francisco.", "author": "Nick C."}

I actually like the cramped space, oil on the walls, and sticky tables. Places like this usually have the best Xiao Long Baos.\n     And BOY do they do the Xiao Long Baos RIGHT. The soup in the dumpling is the most flavorful that I've ever had. When it explodes in your mouth, it IS how others would describe...orgasmic. The skin was soft and delicious, but 2 out of the 6 dumplings broke (even with my surgeon fingers) and let out some of the juices. The portion size was also pretty poor, providing only 6 per order.\n     Other than the Xiao Long Baos, the menu was extremely limited. My favorite Red Oil Wantons were not offered. The shrimp and chive dumplings were ok. The skin was soft and sturdy, the chives were fresh, but the shrimp was nowhere to be found. The Cilantro Tofu Noodles had good flavor, was light and refreshing, but was a little too firm.\n     At this point, it was another HOUR before the next dish came. The green onion pancake was thin and soft, as opposed to thick and flaky. (I like both versions) The pancake was well seasoned and had bold green onion flavor. But SERIOUSLY? an HOUR? The sesame pancake with marinated beef also had nice flavor. However, there was a noticeable lack of sesame and the beef was very soggy.\n     Overall, the Xiao Long Baos are up there, rivaling anything I've ever had. However, the other dishes are a far step down. I did come for the Xiao Long Baos, but variety is still necessary for a complete dining experience. I come to places like this expecting questionable service, but I'll have to see whether I have to wait another hour for a green onion pancake next time.", "author": "Siao W."}

That itself is the main order you want when you go there.  We also ate pork & nappa cabbage dumplings and an order of a lamb or beef dumpling along with some great tasting sauteed green beans & spinach vegetables.  We also tasted the fried chicken - it was good, but a little on the sweet side.  The next time I go, I'll try the grilled skew dishes.

The only thing I like are their hot sauce and shanghai dumplings. Other than that, nothing else really impresses me. This place is dirty, staff is ridiculously snobbish, and they always pack us like sardines. I've seen them seat 6 people in a 4 people table before and I was so tempted to tell them that they're violating the fire safety code. One time when I was waiting in line, I heard a customer asking the boss to order him some additional food and the boss refuses, telling him that there's a long line and he should have ordered it in the beginning. I can't believe what I heard and I can't believe that customer didn't raise a fit either. When I sat down, I ordered 3 dinners and 2 appetizers for our family of four (2 adults and 2 young kids). The waitress has the nerve to tell me that it's not enough. She was very pushy and insisted that I order more. I told her \"No, that's plenty for us already as my kids aren't going to eat much!\" I can understand if I had only ordered 1 dinner and 2 apps, but I ordered a good amount and we ended up boxing a lot of the left overs anyway. \n\nI came back with 2 other coworkers a month later and the similar thing happened. The same waitress, who can't even speak English tried to force us to order more. I got really pissed and told her that we ordered 4 items and we only have 3 people. I don't see how that's not enough. My coworkers said not to argue with them because she doesn't want them to spit in our food. I can't believe it! The owner must have asked his staff to aggressively force people to order more since their place is so small and they want to maximize their profits. The owner is really annoying. He's always in your face.\n\nFinally, have you ever seen their bathroom? You have to go through the kitchen to get to it. It's dingy and gross.

The handmade pork, shrimp and chive dumplings are delicious. Farmer's cucumbers are another favorite. But the XLB were a disappointment. I agree with other yelpers that in San Francisco you just don't find XLB that are as good as in NYC or Asia. The wrappers were thick, but the deal-breaker is the bland soup and meat. Old Shanghai's are far superior in terms of flavor, even though the wrappers there are a little thick as well.\n\nThe service was fast and friendly, and the owner gave helpful suggestions. However, my overall impression is that it's not worth the 20 minute wait to get seated. For northern Chinese food (dumplings, chive and beef pancakes,cumin lamb), you'd do much better at Old Mandarin in Sunset. For XLB and other Shanghainese dishes go to Old Shanghai on Geary.

Pork, beef, chicken, lamb (wait...is that a lyric from a song from 'Mulan'?) For an 8.5 x 11 sheet, the dumpling menu takes up the lower half. \n\nReplacing the defunct 'David's Kitchen', KoD is doing ok, but not spectacularly. Not much has changed decor wise, and I really didn't think in a residential neighborhood, for a restaurant that is basically in the basement of a 1500 square foot house, expansion opportunities were extensive. \n\nWe arrived on a Friday-and all was quiet except for a table of three girls talking some major gossipy smack. The chef is singing what sounds like Chinese opera. Uh-oh. The owner/head waiter was quick to point out a couple of things. First of all, almost all items from the DK menu are still available. And he was sure to show us the fresh dumplings prior their hot water bath. (I guess to let us know they're not frozen) We had:\nPork and chive dumplings\nXiao long bao\nLaquered chicken wings\nDuck curry w/ brown rice\nBeef tendon noodles\n\nFirst up: the pork and chive dumplings. These were delicious. Served with soy and vinegar with fresh ginger julienne pieces, they were hot and juicy. I think there were 9 to the order. Good start. Next up, the hot, tangy almost candied chicken wings in their sweet sticky sauce. Good good stuff. Not crusted or anything, just hot chicken with a crispy sticky glaze. \n\nNext the duck curry. If there's one thing I really admire about this place, it's their curries. They're not thick with coconut milk-but hot, savory, the tiniest bit sweet, herbal (basil) and served with chunks of tender meat (duck in this case), potatoes and zucchini. The sauce is really delicious; perfect with nutty brown rice. The beef noodle tendon is sadly, forgettable. The soup is really light and faint after the strength of the curry. \n\nLast to arrive: soup dumplings. \nBoo...first of all, soup dumpling roulette ensues. First dumpling-NO SOUP. Next dumpling: hot, tongue searing soup. What gives?! Minus points. Stick with the regular dumplings, there's plenty of juice in there to give you the illusion of eating XLB. Service was fine, no complaints here, other than the head waiter being a tiny bit overbearing about what to order. Thankfully, they still have the pan fried taro cake for dessert. I don't care what y'all say about the creme brulee, order the taro cake. \n\nFinal nit-picky, but crucial point, the plastic covers on the menus are sticky and need to be changed.

I won't go into my whole theory about how the Chinese food is different between norcal and socal (and it has to do with new immigrants vs previous generation of immigrants) but here's what i think of this place and why it's just \"all right\".\n\nfood: 3.5 stars\n\n1. dumplings - 3 stars: \n-i'm giving it 4 stars for the selection of dumplings they offer.  there's literally like 30 different kind of dumplings on the menu which is really nice when you have a group that has different preferences on their meat choices.  we tried beef, pork, and lamb dumplings with different combinations of veggies such as chives, napa, and celery?\n-taste wise, just 2-3 stars for me.  the dough is good, handmade and just the right texture, but it's what i would expect from ANY dumpling place.  that's like saying a tortilla is good at a taqueria or the bun is good at panera bread.  the stuffing inside, however, is really bland and boring.    \n2. xiao lung bao - 3.5 stars:\n-again the dough is good, not as thin as ding tai fung's but has its own charm.  and the stuffing is actually more flavorful than the dumplings and has a lot of juice inside so be careful when you bite into it at first.\n3. others - mixed\n-we ordered a stir fry shanghai cabbage and it was actually really tasty.  it was fresh and with just the right amount of seasoning.\n-spicy beef tendon - completely tasteless \n-pot stickers - same as dumpling review\n\n8 of us spent $88 after tax/tip.\n\nservice: 2 stars\nsure, i expect bad service at a chinese restaurant so i wasn't complaining to the manager or leaving a bad tip at the end of the meal or anything.  but seriously they can't treat us like kids just because we're chinese and look young.  they're chinese!! they should know that just because we're wearing t-shirts and jeans doesn't mean we're teenagers!  not only did the server called the guys \"xiao di di\" (little boy) the entire time and talked to us like we're kids the whole time (we're 30 and older..), they try to tell us what to order, how many to order, and practically kicked us out of the restaurant because they wanted to us to finish asap.\ni understand that we had a big party (8) and took up pretty much half of the restaurant, but we are trying to have a meal just like everyone else there!  the server kept coming over to take our dishes away(and indirectly rushing us to finish the food on the dishes), and after throwin us the check on the table (w/o us asking for it), came back to look/touch/check the check and literally stood next to our table and stared us down until we paid and left.  \ntrust me, it's not like this was a nice spot to hang out and chat anyway!!  it is TINY and everytime the train passes by the whole ground shakes.  \n\nSince I'm not from the area, I have no idea where you could go to get better dumplings so this may be your only option.  The dumplings are no doubt authentic and fresh so that's why I would still give it 3 stars and you should try it especially if you have never had fresh dumplings.  However, if you eat fresh dumplings on a regular basis and you're used to flavorful stuffing, you will probably find this place just a little disappointing.", "author": "Cari H."}

I went here with my friend and ordered Shanghai Dumplings, Pork & Corn Dumplings, Pork & Napa Cabbage Dumplings, Garlic String Beans, Wide Cold Soybean Noodles, and Crispy Chicken Wings. Yeahhhhh....We ordered a lot for 2 people because we were super hungry. We didn't have to wait long to get seated but we had to wait to order. The waiters went to tables that were seated after us and we waited a while. The Shanghai Dumplings fell apart more than I was used to which is a disappointment because the whole reason for those dumplings is to have that burst of soup in your mouth.

Literally a hole int he wall. Oh, the moment you step in, it's like entering a sauna (not really, but it's a good 10 degrees warmer inside) due to the steaming/boiling of various dumplings. This place is tiny AND crowded, get here early!\n\nService: It's alright, nothing too bad or amazingly good. The people were friendly, but it's a family business so everyone's running around juggling twenty tasks at a time.\n\nFood: The juicy part! the Xiao Long Bao are sort of overrated. But wait! The XLB is still pretty good, but I don't think it lives up to the over-inflated hype Yelpers have given it. Rather, I think the dumplings are overlooked: fantastic, and I mean fantastic dumplings. Good, tasty stuff. I'd recommend the dumplings, and the 'fried buns'.\n\nPrices: I would've liked cheaper, but the prices are really reasonable. 12 dumplings run $5-7 or something like that. XLB runs at 6 for something like $5. Don't quote me on those. It seems inexpensive here, but be ready to order two plates per if you're a voracious eater.\n\nOverall, 4 stars is where it's at.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-02-02", "description": "On one afternoon, craving for dim sum, I decided to step away from the usual and try something different.  Someone had told me that if I really like Yank Sing's Shanghai Dumplings - I must try Kingdom of Dumplings as their is comparable, so instead of spending another fortune at Yank Sing, I opted to travel out to the farthest end of San Francisco for some hopefully good Chinese food.  Rob, who likes to stick to what he knows, didn't want to go - and I basically had to coax, convince, beg, demand and insist that we go all the way out to the Sunset area to try this new place.\n \nThings you should know:\n \nTHIS PLACE IS SMALL.\nI don't mean compared to Yank Sing - I mean it's SMALL.  It has about 8 tables - and their kitchen is about the size of my bathroom.  You will have to go through the kitchen to get to their bathroom - and you WILL pass a bucketful of MSG and basically see how they cook everything.\n \nTHEY DO NOT SPEAK ANY ENGLISH.\nI don't mean they aren't fluent, I mean, seriously, they don't speak any English at all, and I speak no Chinese at all, so this made communication slightly difficult, but it was funny.  The woman who is the cook here is a lovely woman who was friendly and seemed very nice, but of course, she could have been insulting me w/ a smile and I would not know the difference.  There are plenty of other Asian restaurants around where nobody speaks English, including many Korean joints, so don't get me wrong - - shame on me for not knowing any Chinese is what I mean.\n \nWe ordered, I kid you not, a TON of food.\nPrice are quite economical here, and we figured we'd try it all!\n \nWe ordered one order each of a beef dumpling, pork dumpling, shrimp dumpling.  We also ordered a salt and pepper tofu, beef pancake, and of course, had to try the Shanghai Dumplings.  I can honestly say that all the dumplings were good, but they all tasted basically the same, be it beef, pork, or shrimp.  That said, servings are generous.  We seemed to get at least 12 big dumplings for each order that cost about $7 each. Salt and pepper tofu was OUTSTANDING and plentiful for $4.99, served piping hot and crispy on the outside, soft as puffs of clouds on the inside, nicely seasoned.  The Shanghai Dumplings were good - - - but they can't hold a candle to Yank Sing's.  The beef pancakes were pretty mediocre - and we each took and bite and put it down -  it was basically all oil and turned out to be like a Chinese quesadilla type dish with some creamed beef in the middle or something.  (No offense if it's your thing - I'm just saying it wasn't my thing.)  \n \nWe also had a \"beef stew noodle soup w/ noodles\" - - except we had asked if it was a stew or soup.  They couldn't understand what we were asking, and looked stumped.  We explained we were looking for a soup w/ noodles - - nothing thick like a stew, but the language barrier was clear.  OK... so we just said yes, and pointed, and the man said, \"OK?\"  We said \"OK\" and the order was placed.  He held up one index finger, asking us if we wanted only one - and we nodded.  Then the woman came back out and pointed to the item on the menu to confirm, and said, \"Soup?\"  So we nodded.\n \nFive minutes later, out came the soup WITHOUT noodles....hahaha!  \nNow, all the other dishes, I really didn't feel like we were being doused w/ MSG.  For this soup, I could taste and smell it.  The chunks of beef in here, including tendons and such, were really not very good, and the soup had a stench or scent to it, much like the typical \"Beef Noodle Soup\" at a Chinese restaurant has.  I usually like that, but in this case, it was more of a stench than a scent - and we barely made a dent in it.  Those who know Rob knows he eats soup even if it's just hot water w/ salt - - and for him not to finish a soup down to the last drop was a first for me.\n \nEven with all of this food, the bill only came to $40 something.  Also notable was that at the time of 1:30 pm, this restaurant was getting progressively more crowded whereas it was emptier when we arrived.  They were predominantly Chinese people, so I'm inclined to think that this place actually does serve very authentic dishes.  \n\nLike I said, the dumplings were good - but with places like \"Taiwan Restaurant\" which I reviewed right before this, I don't see myself making it back out to this area for dumplings.\n \nWhile our meal here was decent, nothing really stood out.  Worth a try - sure.  Will I be a regular?  No.  \n\nAs a sidenote, due to the language barrier, this may be one of those places you just have to come with someone who is native to this language, and knows what to order.  It's plausible that we ordered wrong... but since I went for the dumplings and those were good, I'll stick to 3 stars, rounded up just because.\n \nSo, while it doesn't happen often (in my opinion, anyhow) - - he was right, I was wrong.  Should have gone to Yank Sing!", "author": "Grace K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-07-18", "description": "Stumbled in on a cold winter night after a long day's work hoping to fill my belly with warm dumplings. This dumpling shop is very small with very limited seating and because all the seven tables were full, we waited outside in the rain momentarily before the owner pulled us in and sat me down at another customer's table which made an awkward situation for all of us. I opted to stand up in the doorway to wait for a table instead. Twenty minutes later, we were seated at a small cramped corner table by the window that was so drafty I kept my winter coat on all throughout dinner. We ordered their \"famous\" Xiao Long Bao (Shanghai soup dumplings) and chicken dumplings with napa cabbage, one of their many many types of dumplings offered. The owner was gregarious and pressured us to order an appetizer as well so we chose the beef tendon appetizer. The next thirty minutes of waiting for our food was painful since we were hungry and it's hard to watch other tables enjoy the dumplings. Finally, we were served the beef tendon appetizer which was cold (not mentioned on the menu), shredded and drowned with an over abundance of cilantro and lime juice. It was too salty and cilantro-y and we barely ate any of it. I definitely could have done without it, a dish I didn't want in the first place. Finally after another twenty minutes, the long awaited dumplings came and I anxiously dove in but was instantly disappointed. The dumplings were cold and the dumpling skins were very thick, bland, and unappealingly chewy. The cold dumplings with the cold appetizer and the overall cold atmosphere made a very unpleasant depressing meal. We ate half of the dumplings out of hunger and took the rest home to heat up properly for a second dinner.

We got the chicken dumplings with chicken and corn and it was pretty flavourful; but I'll be honest and say I prefer soy sauce for the dumplings rather than the mixed sauce they give you- so just ask! We also got the pork potstickers because I'm a huge fan, and the noodles around them were just so fresh tasting and the pork was so greasy so it was like a little bit of heaven in my mouth. Hot hot heaven. Also got the chicken chow mein with the most fresh tasting noodles I've had in a while. But with a hint of grease to make it just right and filling. And a delicious Thai tea to wash it down with. My only issue with the place was the waitress who basically told us that we should order more food, especially the items that they were famous for, and pointed to the Chronicle review on the table- as if what we ordered was not good enough or something like that.

She left our table without a word. Then through the kitchen window, I saw that they mixed up our orders with other tables. Then about 5 minutes, our lamb dumplings were here. I had my first bite, and it tasted different. So I looked inside the meat, IT IS RAW!!!! It is literally raw inside! OMG, so I asked the girl to come over and whispered to her that it is undercooked. She grabbed the dish and walked back into the kitchen. And through the kitchen window, I saw the chief said \"ma fan\" (which means in English, troublesome). About 5 minutes or so, she slide in the lamb dumpling dish and said \"it is cooked\". WOW...... this lady did not even apologize for what had  happened. She showed no emotion. First it was the messed up order, then it was the uncooked dumpling. There was no apology, like she doesn't even feel sorry.

Most places I've been to around here have the word \"dumpling\" in their name but really they only serve potstickers and xiao long bao.  This place actually serves a variety of dumplings with different types of meat.  It was a pretty good selection.  \n\nSince it was our first time, we thought we'd just try some basics like potstickers, xiao long bao, pork & napa dumplings, chicken & chive dumplings.  They were all quite good.  The xiao long bao had a very flavorful broth.  Both dumplings we ordered were pretty darn good and the dough was nice and soft.  The potstickers were only ok.  The meat was good but I thought they could have been pan fried a bit more.\n\nWe also ordered the sesame pancake w/ beef.  It was pretty good but it would have been better if the beef was warmed up.  I guess it's supposed to be served slightly cold with the sesame pancake warm.\n\nThe last thing on the menu we ordered was chicken & spinach dumpling in noodle soup.  The broth was flavorful without being too salty (as in full of MSG).  \n\nI'd definitely go back again but damn this place is small.

Not anywhere near the best that I have ever had but much better than many other places in SF.\n- The Chicken and Spinach wonton soup noodles were decent. I couldn't really taste the spinach but the broth wasn't too oily or salty.\nIf you are looking for a light soup noodle dish, this is an alternative to the beef noodle soup.\n- The Pork and Napa dumplings were pretty good too. The skin wasn't too chewy and the dumplings weren't overcooked and soggy.\n\nJUST OKAY:\n- The Chives Pancake was very average. Something about it was missing. If you have never had it before you will probably like it but I eat this type of food pretty often and other places are better.\n\nBAD:\n- This place is tiny! It only has like 20 seats and will fill up fast! I went on a Saturday and got there around 5:30PM and it was half-full. By 6:00PM, the line started forming. \n- Service could be better because there was only like 1-server and she was overwhelmed by all the tables. I had to remind her twice of things that we ordered but were forgotten.\n- You have to walk through the middle of the kitchen to get to the bathroom. This isn't necessarily bad but it might be off-putting for some people. \n- Right after eating here, I had an **Allergic Reaction** and broke out into hives. I eat plenty of dirty street food and I don't have any known food allergies and this only happens to me once or twice a year and I don't want to blame this restaurant but another reviewer also had the same complaint. My date also complained that she had a stomach ache later that evening. Maybe it is all a coincidence but it is also possible that the quality of their ingredients is lacking. (Minus 1/2-star for this)\n\nCONCLUSION: Nothing here was exceptional but I was surprised that 4 out of 4 dishes were good/decent. I would give this place 3.5 stars if that was an option.

Over the next hour, it got crowded and the 2 wait staff (owner who took the orders and a young lady who cleared the plates, filled the tea and gave you the bill) couldn't really handle the full room in a timely manner.  The owner came in the door after we got our tea with a jelly roll tray of raw dumplings all lined up, they sure looked good. \nWe perused the menu and settled on 6 items:\npotstickers, chicken fried rice, beef chow fun, chicken and spinach dumplings, vegetarian egg rolls (they were out of the chicken ones) and a dumpling soup.  The owner suggested we try the dumplings pictured in a review hanging on the wall and the cilantro bean thread.  We declined both. \nIt took a long time for the orders to arrive, dish by dish, very slowly.  In other words, you're not getting outta here anytime soon if you're in a hurry.  The beef chow fun was the first to appear with pieces of beef, fun noodle, bean sprouts.  It was pretty good.  Then the potstickers arrived,  6 of them lined up on a plate.  They were slightly pan-fried with a thick skin and a juicy filling of meat.\nThe steamed chicken and spinach dumplings presented later with 12 small and juicy flavorful dumplings loaded with a large serving of chopped spinach and bits of chicken.  The fried rice was good with chucks of grlled chicken and mixed vegts. \nUnexpectedly, a steamer of Shanghai dumplings (xiao lung bao) materialized and was placed on our table.  We stared at it & remarked amongst ourselves that we didn't order it.  But, rather than make a scene, we decided to try it.  The owner either misunderstood with his limited English, accidentally or purposely ordered the Shanghai dumplings.  We'll give him the benefit of the doubt but he actually did us a favor as the Shanghai dumplings were delicious, rivaling the ones I've had at Yank Sing.  They were nicely twisted closed at the top with a good amt of broth inside and a nice chunk of meat filling.  I would venture back for this dish alone.  The vegt egg roll was the disappointment of the day.  Crispy skinned egg rolls with carrots and visible purple and green cabbage filling which was rather bland. \nThe 7th dish was the dumpling soup.  Probably my 2nd favorite dish of the day.  Crescent shaped dumplings manuvered into a circle shape with a mushroomy broth, mushrooms, 3 large chunks of Shanghai bok choy and ho fun noodle.  We ended up taking home some of the fried rice and chow fun because we couldn't finish.  The bill came to about $48 which was all written in Chinese characters.  If you can't read Chinese, you won't know if you were charged for the correct items.  We counted to make sure we were only billed for 7 items. \nSo, the food is good, skip the egg rolls, a sure winner is the steamed Shanghai dumplings but minus 1 for giving us an item we didn't order even 'tho it was very good.", "author": "Ry T."}

Shanghai Style Soup Dumplings).\nThis past Sunday, me and my two discerning food friends went across the city in hopes to get our XLB fix.  Now I haven't been one to go out of my way for XLB in the bay area, but I am pretty familiar with quality XLB's having had extensively eaten my way across China, Taiwan & Hongkong.  Also my asian mom has access to the asian mom mahjong networks and so we've been to some pretty poppin' chinese places. \nAnyway back to the food.  So we ordered an ordered:\nPork/Shrimp/Chive Dumplings- GOOD combo. Probably the tastiest thing of the meal\nPork/Cabbage Dumplings- A standard good eat\nShanghai Style Soup Dumplings (XLB)- Not bad. Could have had more soup. The skin was a little to easily broken :(\nOnion Pancake- Good. very tasty and crunchy. A little oily, but no complaints.\nGarlic-y Cucumber coldplate- They are mashed as opposed to cut.  Different but some pieces were too small and makes it difficult to pick up with chopsticks.\n\nOverall the dumplings here were not bad. I like the consistency of the dumpling skin, very Q ( english equivalent to chewy, al dente?) \nI would come here if I need a dumpling fix, but not necessarily for the XLBs.", "author": "gee t."}

Needless to say, the place is small and stuffy, the dumpling taste like frozen food w/o any flavor.  The other dish was spicy chicken wings and they were raw inside. So when we asked to recook the same dish, the cook spoke in Mandarin to us (assuming that we understood the language) rudely.  One of the worse dining experiences we had.

I'm giving it 1 star not because of the dumplings, because those were good, but the 1 star is because of the HORRIBLE service!  The wait wasn't too bad, got a table that we had to share with 2 other people.  Thankfully the 2 other people were very nice so no big deal.  We ordered, food started coming out.  The 5 spice beef was gross.  The special cucumber salad was good and the fried tofu was OK. \n\nHere's the service issue that occurred, about 15 minutes after our first dish came out we decided we wanted to try the pot stickers too so we flagged down someone to add another dish.  Wait, let me back up... I asked for hot water when we sat down, never got it.  Asked again, still never got it. Back to the pot stickers, a few minutes later the waitress comes back and tells us it'll be 15 mins for the pot stickers and we respond with Okay.  She then clarifies, 50 minutes like an hour. Uh, what?  I misunderstood and thought pot stickers took longer so I said, \"Okay, can we get the pork and cabbage dumplings instead?\" Same answer, 50 minutes.  We weren't in a hurry and we haven't gotten all our dishes yet so we said okay.  Then the girl tells us, \"No.\" No?  \"No.\"  No, we could not order anything else. Wow.  We ended up finishing the rest of our food then chatted with our table mates for about another 30 mins, they were shocked at the way we were treated. While we were talking their last dish came about 15 minutes after they were done eating. Since they had to go, he asked the waitress can they just box it up to go. Her response was to shove the plate back at him and said \"You take it and put it in a box yourself.\"  Awesome treatment. They shared with us that it wasn't like that before, ever since they've gotten busier their service has been terrible. Guess they don't need to treat their customers nice anymore. We all decided that will be the last time we ever eat there especially since there are other dumpling places! \n\nFinal note: dumplings are good but the abuse is not worth it.  Go down a couple blocks to Dumpling Kitchen for dumplings just as good, cleaner, bigger space and no abuse or rudeness.", "author": "San Francisco T."}

It took us about 30-45 min to get a table.  We decided to order just dumplings since this place is supposedly known for it.  We were craving the Xiao Long Bao so we ordered the pan fried and steamed versions.  We also ordered the potstickers and the shrimp and chive dumplings.  The XLBs were the biggest disappointment....the skins on both versions did not hold up the soup at all or maybe these dumplings were just overcooked.  The pan fried versions were practically dry inside.  Luckily I enjoy adding the soy vinegar ginger dipping sauce into my dumplings, so that helped.  The steamed XLBs were practically shriveled up so there was no soup left inside either.  Some of the skins also punctured easily upon handling with the chopsticks.  We thought the shrimp and chive dumplings would save our meal, but they accidentally added 3 lamb dumplings into the plate.  I had the unfortunate surprise of eating two of them and was disgusted, as I hate the taste of lamb.  We didn't make any complaints because it would have been too difficult to explain to the waitress when all the dumplings look alike.  The saving grace was actually the pot stickers.  They were well breaded and pan fried and actually had more juice/soup in them than the XLBs.  I would come back for just the pot stickers but honesly, I would likely not come back and rather try other dumpling restaurants.", "author": "Joodee Y."}

Dumpy place with what appears to be a husband and wife team that really makes Northern Chinese dumplings.  It's home cooking Chinese style, and yes, this is the real stuff.  The dumplings were a little heavier in the dough and meat than the Manchurian dumplings I eat at least once a month in China - but certainly within the authentic bell curve.  Get a cucumber salad appetizer, some pork and chive dumplings, some cold beer, and how can you go wrong?  \n\nI also tasted their pork dumplings with \"sour chinese vegetable\" (the Chinese invented sauerkraut - that's what I read, anyway).  It's missing the tang of the version i often eat in China, but I'm not complaining.  Their specials on the board looked westernized, but the printed menu has a small sampling of what appears to be real Chinese food.   (Missing a variety vegetables though)\n\nGreat place to take Americans to expose them to something real from China.   Just don't bring anyone who needs a polished hygienic atmosphere.\n\nNote:  They serve the vinegar and soy in separate dipping bowls.  Add a little bit of the vinegar to the soy bowl and dip your dumplings in that one.  That's the way it tastes in China.", "author": "David Z."}

They come out steaming hot, six to an order.  Watch out when you bite into the first dumpling, don't burn your mouth!  Also, don't forget to use your big Chinese soup spoon to hold the dumpling before biting into it because the dumplings really do hold soup!  The boiled dumplings (sui jiao) are also wonderful - I have tried two types of the eight or so they offer - the vegetarian and lamb with Chinese vegetable.  Each order has 12 of these delectable morsels, featuring a handrolled flour wrapper surrounding a plump pocket of perfectly seasoned ground meat (or tofu for the veggie version) laced with finely chopped Chinese vegetables (e.g. napa cabbage, Chinese celery, or spinach).  The dumplings are cooked in boiling water and then served to your table piping hot.  The last menu item I really loved was the lo bo si bing (shredded turnip cakes).  Each order features two perfectly baked golden brown sesame seed topped balls, filled with a delectable mixture of shredded daikon and ground pork.  At $2.95 an order, it's not bad for a little piece of culinary heaven.\n\nOh, and the appetizers are pretty tasty too.  The tofu thread salad with cilantro is marinated in a delicate rice vinegar and sesame oil dressing.  I look forward to trying the other menu items.  The clientele is mostly native mainland Chinese speakers and other folks who are in the know.  This restaurant is a hidden gem in the Parkside, and I hope it can develop a enthusiastic following and continue to serve up authentic northern style Chinese cuisine for some time to come.", "author": "Elaine L."}

My friend from Taiwan tells me that it sounds even cooler in Chinese!\n\nAnd I think it lives up to that...it is a Kingdom of Dumplings, but not much else.\n\nThe Shanghai Soup Dumplings are definitely the best I've had in SF.  Much better than Shanghai Dumpling King (Balboa and 34th).     The Pork Dumplings with Green Chives were pretty good.   Both of these are also available frozen (as are all their other dumplings).  I took roughly $25 worth of frozen dumplings home with me.\n\nThe Vegetarian Dumplings were just okay.   I'm used to the kind with more mushroom, more glass noodle, maybe some more bamboo?   These were well-seasoned, but mostly full of napa cabbage, with a touch here of ginger and egg.   \n\nThe Sesame Pancake with Meat (or Beef?)  was pretty good.   I'm used to the five-spice beef, hoisin sauce and fresh green onion all rolled up in a Green Onion Pancake.   This version was not as decadant, but okay.  My friend from Taiwan was liked the pancake better than the filling.\n\nWe also ordered the Beef Noodle Soup...which is really not what you think of when you think Chinese Beef Noodle Soup.   If you taste the broth---a hint of the aniseed, beef is there...but this is NOT Beef Noodle Soup.   I think it would have been better if they added a bit more anise stars, and some tomato, perhaps a carrot or some daikon.     They should rename it.  It's more like Noodle Soup with beef.    \n\nWe also ordered Salty Soybean Milk---which is my all-time favorite thing to eat!   Since it's so rarely on a menu, I always order it.   This is my fourth time ordering it in SF, and 3 out of 4 times---it was really horrible.   (The one okay time was at Taste of Formosa.  Just okay.)    This time also was really, particularly bad.   There were no floating pieces of oil donuts, no preserved radish, no chili oil and no vinegar.   (I know it sounds bad, but if you ever try a good version of this, it is truly heavenly.  Unfortunately, I'm convinced you have to go to New York or Taiwan to have it.)\n\nIn all---i would totally go back, and buy and eat dumplings.  Yeah, the decor, the low ceiling, the odd-ly packed in tables, the lone waiter talking the entire time to his friend on his cell phone...but it is a hole-in-the-wall after all.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-02-16", "description": "I ate there on 12/29/08 and the first thing that struck me was - THIS IS SUCH A SMALL SPACE!  I mean, really, the seating is very small and tight.  The table/seat that is right by the door to the establishment may end up bumping the person who is sitting there because of the small dimensions of the dining room.\n\nAlso, the place is very non-descript.  Nothing fancy, just the room, tables, chairs, and the menus.  Is that necessarily bad?  No, as long as one doesn't have unreasonable expectations.  It seems that I tend to eat at a lot of hole-in-the-wall establishments.  So, here goes another review of just such a place.\n\nI set aside my impression of the interior and focused on the food on the menu.\n\nThey offered some uncommon dishes, so we ordered the chicken and spinach wonton with wide rice noodes, the lamb dumplings with Chinese vegetables, the green chives pancake, and the sesame pancake with marinated beef.\n\nThe sesame pancake with marinated beef was very good and the dough that they used to make it was nice and crispy.  Think of it as being something like a stuffed pizza (but not so big) and like an empanada (again, not so big).  The flavor was great.\n\nThe lamb dumplings were okay, too.  It wasn't what I expected, but I was willing to try it since I'd never had lamb dumplings before.  Many dumplings are usually made of pork chicken meat.  The chicken and spinach wonton with noodles were good, too.  I guess if I were to describe it, the term comfort food comes to mind.\n\nOverall, the food was good.  I didn't have any problems with what they offered, how it was made, and how it tasted.  It was good.  Plain and simple.  For our party of four (my wife, son, my mother and I), the bill was very affordable!  It came to just around $30 with the tip.\n\nSince the kitchen was very close by, one could see that the food was being freshly prepared.  But, the other thing that could be seen was how cramped it was in there, too.\n\nWhen I had to go use the restroom, I had to go through the kitchen area and it was almost like doing the do-si-do because you had to dance around the cook and be careful about the traffic flow through the kitchen and the stove.\n\nDrawbacks?  Well, the person who took our order did not speak very much English, which did make communicating difficult for other customers who spoke no Mandarin at all.  My wife and I helped another patron who clearly was having a difficult time trying to make their needs known to the server.\n\nAnother problem:  even after the other tables were empty, the staff took a long time to clear the tables of the dishes.  That meant that they got stacked up and didn't go anywhere for quite a while.  So, that was a mild turn-off.  If they were to get really busy on any given day, what would happen then?  That made me wonder.\n\nBut, again, the food was good, the prices very reasonable, and the staff were pleasant.  Still, they really need to do something about the seating arrangements and to take care of things in the main dining area a little faster.  It's not a good impression to a prospective customer when they see a lot of dishes sitting at empty tables that are waiting to be cleared.\n\nTheir take out menu had a URL listed, but I checked it and it didn't pull up their website at all.  I have no idea what happened and when, but you won't find anything about them unless you come here to Yelp or to check out the other links that may come up in your search engine (like restaurant reviews in other local newspapers).\n\nIf they can help themselves get past these humps, people will find that this is a good place to eat.  I wouldn't count this place out, but I am not really going to be rushing back here, either.\n\nStreet parking is all that is available, with much of it being metered along Taraval Street.  There may be some residential parking available, but that is still a hit-or-miss proposition.  This is San Francisco, after all.\n\nI would not recommend large groups of people coming here because seating isn't exactly spacious.", "author": "E L."}

This repeat patron is NEVER going back to Kingdom of Dumpling!! \n\nTo make a long and extremely unpleasant story short, it took 40 minutes to get one item in our order, a cold bean noodle; 50 minutes to get our dumplings; and approximately 65 minutes to get the last, but by then, unwanted item, a chive pancake.\n\nService has always been slow here.  The disorganized wait staff never remembers the order in which they seat their diners and takes food orders out of sequence.  Your party may be the second table seated, but they often take the order of a later seated table before yours.  Okay, I get that this is a small business with a limited staff, but the dining room is so small and cramped (about 10 small tables) that I can't understand how two waiters could miss a diner with raised hand waving for service!\n\nFresh dumplings can take from 20-30 minutes to cook.  I expect to wait that long for my dumpling order to be ready.  What I don't expect is to wait 30 minutes only to have the waitress come back to my table with a menu in hand announcing the kitchen has run out of the kind of dumplings my husband and I had ordered 30 minutes ago.  Could we order another kind of dumpling.  Why didn't she tell us that when we first placed the order!?  And what about the other two items in our order that do not require such a long cooking time?  My husband and I had now been sitting in this restaurant for over 40 minutes with nothing in front of us but a pot of very weak tea watching other tables that had been seated about the same time as we had been, and even after us, consume their food and leave.\n\nDuring the interminable wait, my husband kept inquiring of the waitress as to the status of our food order and she kept replying that the kitchen was cooking it.  She lied!  Finally, in total frustration, we decided not to wait any longer.  We voiced out complaints to the proprietor, expressed our desire to not wait for the final item, and requested the tab for the two dishes we actually got.  The owner, however, with no apology for the incompetency of his wait and kitchen staff and our extremely long wait, insisted that since the pancake was (finally) being cooked as we were registering our complaints and requesting the bill, he wants us to pay for it!  My husband was so irate at this point by the horrendous service and the avaricious attitude of the owner that he didn't care that the whole restaurant heard him arguing with the owner!  Eventually, our hunger drove us to end the impasse so we could go somewhere else to appease our growling stomachs.  \n\nIt is obvious this restaurant owner does not value his repeat customers if he is willing to risk future business and a bad Yelp review for a mere $5.95 worth of chive pancake.", "author": "Lillian C."}

It tastes like a mix of chinese mustard and chili sauce ( in the best way possible ) . It's very flavorful and pretty spicy ! I love this place !! I was thinking of thinking this place 4 stars but because of their XLB , XO beef chow fun , hot sauce , and interesting menu , I'm giving it 5 stars instead . Also because the food here is pretty good when it comes to San Francisco Shanghai food standards . There's so many things on the menu I haven't tried yet ! They all seem so delicious so I'll definitely be back V^______^V !! Btw , be sure to get here early because the restaurant is small and it gets filled up easily so you might have to wait .", "author": "Eileen L."}

Gotta say San Tung on Irving still has the best dumplings in Bay Area and possibly in the world!  Well, we had some dumplings in Beijing and were somewhat disappointed, that's why I said that.  Maybe we need to travel to the San Tung Province in order to determine if San Tung Restaurant in SF in fact does have the best dumplings in the world!  \n\nSorry...  a bit off track here...  The cold dish here is good too.  The cilantro with tofu, lotus seed, beef tendon are all good appetizers.  \n\nOwner of the restaurant is super friendly and offer free dessert from time to time!", "author": "bubu s."}

The selection of dumplings is good, with a variety of meat, veggies and shrimp combinations.  You can get the boiled or pan fried, and both combinations are good.  I keep meaning to go back and ask for frozen dumplings for me to take home.\n\nThe dumplings here are just awesome.  You take a bite, and the soup comes squirting out - the way they should.  I personally like pork & chives or shrimp & chives, but all of the dumplings I've had here are good.  Their other food is also good, like the onion pancakes, wonton soup, and they've got really good vegetable dishes too.  If you've managed to save room for dessert, ask for the vanilla bean flan - the waiter takes a propane torch and browns it for you.  A great end to any meal!\n\nBest thing - this place is hella cheap.  What a great value.  And there's one waiter who's a real riot - super friendly and loves recommending dishes to anyone (if you were recommended the lamb skewer, you'll know who I'm talking about).", "author": "JoJo B."}

Apparently when we arrived the waitress had not arrived, so the cook took our order, problem was that none of us spoke Chinese and no one that was working spoke English.  We got our order by pointing and gestures.  We ordered 2 orders of Shanghai Soup Dumplings, 2 orders of Shrimp Dumplings, and the Beef Pancake.  One of the ladies came out and tried to explain to us something, and we were not sure what was going on. The Shrimp Dumplings came out, and they were pretty bland.  Then the beef pancakes came out, it was greasy, but good.  We waited and were wondering what happened to the Soup Dumplings.  Finally the English speaking waitress arrived and told us that were out of the Shanghai Soup Dumplings.  We were all very disappointed, so we looked at the menu trying to figure out a substitution.  Then the waitress came out and said they had some, so we were all happy. They came out and it was the first time for all of us and the dumplings did not disappoint.  They were very yummy.  We had 2 orders which came out to 10 dumplings.  After we polished them off we wanted another order, but we were told that they were too busy for us to order more.  What?!? So that sucked.  So, I liked the Soup Dumplings were worth coming here for, but I don't think it is worth warranting a repeat.", "author": "Peter W."}

I ordered lamb dumplings which were fairly good. However, I don't know whether it was the dumplings or the chilli sauce that I had with it, but I got a tummy upset which lasted a couple of days! I'm BIG on hot & spicy food, so if I get a stomach issue, it's usually because of unhygenic food. In terms of ambience, it was a bit shabby and the whole place smelled wierd - like it's not been cleaned in ages. Ok it's a hole-in-the-wall, but I've seen some such places make it big by getting the food, service and hygene right. I'm surprised to see so many good ratings for this restaurant. There obviously was something others were able to see (or eat) that I wasn't.\n\nThe service was quite unimpressive. The whole family (which happens to be the staff) ate lunch at a nearby table and didn't pay enough attention to the customers that walked in. Hey, I understand everyone needs a break to eat lunch, but do it without compromising customer service - perhaps close for and hour in between, or take turns eating or something! As I got ready to check out, I was presented with an UNITEMIZED check with some gibberish written in Chinese. WTF? Is that supposed to give a more \"authentic\" Chinese touch to it? As if that wasn't annoying enough, as I got ready to pay with my credit card, the waiter said that he \"preferred cash\". Ok, my bad, I didn't carry enough cash - I insisted on paying by card, but the buggar came back saying his CC machine had run out of printing paper. By the time I was done paying by borrowing cash from my girlfriend, I'd made up my mind that this was my first & last visit to this place.", "author": "Dan C."}

The food compares really well with my other favorite dumpling place down in Millbrae, Shanghai Dumpling Shop.  \n\nThe dumplings are really fresh and tasty.  What was a pleasant surprise was the beef tendon noodle soup with the wide noodles.  The broth was nicely flavored with shiitake mushrooms and was very light and tasty.  I'll be going back soon to try the rest of the menu.\n\nThe place is really tiny but had no problem being seated.  The owner also works the tables and was a really nice and friendly guy.

Tiny little place with lots of character and heart! I had more fun people watching then eating my food even though the food was good. We ordered pork potstickers and veggie potstickers, steamed and regular. My friend wanted rice but the waiter said they were all out of rice....odd. (not to mention when some other Asians came in later they had a bowl of rice) Very clean friendly place with a huge variety of people, I enjoyed myself immensely. The funniest part to me was I had asked if they had a restroom and the waiter and the manager (I'm guessing) said yes very enthusiastically but never said where it was haha. So when I asked the manager, after him saying yes I asked where was it? He said let me show you! so he guided me to the back of the kitchen where alas there was the bathroom (forgive my long story on the bathroom, it was just amusing and to me it's part of my experience, I'm strange like that) bathroom was ok, not the cleanest and not well stocked but it served it's purpose.

The windows were frosty and had some kind of.. crust.. on them.  The sign was scratched up.  No one was in there.  My dad had to drag me into the restaurant, and why insisted to go inside was beyond me.  \nHowever, as I stepped inside the restaurant and took a more careful look, it wasn't half as bad.  There were about 7 tables total and the utensils looked clean.  The walls were old but were painted a happy milky yellow.  Not bad.  \nWe ordered the Shanghai dumplings, onion pancake, salty soybean milk, and some sort of noodle that wasn't good enough for me to remember.  The Shanghai dumplings were DELICIOUS (**TIP**: judge your dumplings by how much soup is in there when you bite in and how moist the meat is); they were practically puffed up with dumpling-juice.\nThe onion pancake was so damn crispy and addictive.  There wasn't much onion in there, though.  \nThe soybean milk didn't have enough goodies in it, but it was good nonetheless \n**TIP**: real good salty soybean milk is loaded with goodies such as seaweed, dried shrimp, and dried pork meat (yook sung)).  \n\nThe two people who served us (the owners, I assume) didn't know English at all, so it was hilarious when two American people came in and tried to ask for something that wasn't on the menu.  \n\nAnd I was surprised to know that they have a location on Noriega where they sell more than 30 different kinds of potstickers/dumplings so you can purchase them and cook it yourself.", "author": "Connie P."}
