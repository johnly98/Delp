I think I favor the icing at Sprinkles, but the actual cake of the cupcake at SusieCakes.  One day I should do a side by side comparison.  Until then, there's a lot I like about SusieCakes:\n\n- Slices from whole cakes are available. Slices are extremely generous.  In fact, if you care at all about your health, you won't come close to consuming an entire slice.  It's really super good, super sweet and super deelish, but just don't do it.  Yes, they're that large! I like the cake with rainbow sprinkles, but they also make whole coconut cakes, carrot cakes, etc. You can't miss them, as they're displayed on top of the case, directly in front, tempting you during your entire stay.  Often, my original game plan was to purchase just one cupcake, but I would leave with a slice of cake instead, or sometimes with both a cupcake and a slice of cake. Now, that's bad!\n\n- Mini cupcakes are available.  You definitely get more value by getting the standard cupcake, but the minis are there if you just want a little taste.  Only problem is that it keeps you wanting more and more.  If you have good self control, and are missing the addiction gene, it's a great option.\n\n- Seasonal cakes will also appear, especially around the holidays.\n\n- Friendly and efficient employees.\n\n- Cute, but super small bakery with 4 seats available.\n\n- Located on Chestnut Street, where you can easily spend some time shopping or just strolling with your cupcake in hand.", "author": "Lori N."}

The result looked the staff had put in the least required effort to get it out the door...what it said to me was \"100...so what?\"  The lettering looked like it had been done by an earnest but not particularly artistic seventh-grader, and the cake had very little edging (despite my requesting this). I had also wanted some kind of gold accent (e.g., flakes), and all they offered was goldish loose sugar -- which I was told wouldn't really show up.  \n\nI was offered a fix of the edges that would take 15-20 minutes, which I didn't have.

SusieCakes absolutely rose to the occasion! Our friends could not stop gushing about how delicious and gorgeous it was (we provided our own the topper - we aren't garbage pigeon birds IRL, we promise, they're just an inside joke). We needed a cake for 100 people, and with our budget, the only way we could afford that elsewhere was if we got a tiny ceremonial cake and then a sheet cake for everyone else. I had resigned myself to not being able to afford a lovely, multi-tiered cake until we came across SusieCakes. SusieCakes' prices were so amazingly low compared to other local wedding cake makers that we could afford a four-tier of four different cake  flavors. You'd think that for a price that good the taste would be awful, but every single flavor and tier was so delicious, and SusieCakes offers so many different flavors we had trouble deciding what to go with. Luckily, Park Lee, the assistant celebration specialist with whom we coordinated everything, was so chill and so wonderful.

Susie Cakes has a distinction with its cupcakes that it tours as \"frosting filled\".

Cake slices could be a little bigger for the price given.\n\nService is definitely lacking so I'm not sure why there are reviews raving about their service.

Frosting was crusty on the surface as if the cupcakes had been drying for a few days in the open air. Bought ones with stock words written on them from the glass case, already prepped, not knowing there was an additional $1 charge on each, so getting to the register was a shock. A single vanilla cupcake will run $4.50 and with SF tax, you'll be paying $5 total for each cupcake, meaning a dozen will run you $60. I can get an entire phenomenal cake from Cafe Madeleine or Whole Cakes for less than that, and feed more people.\n\nDisappointing. Incredibly. Under other circumstances, I'd give this joint another chance, but not at these price points.", "author": "Alison A."}

I've never been to their actual stores but i've had their cake/cupcake from work functions. I had their chocolate cake, strawberry cupcake, cookies.\n\nTheir chocolate cake was really decadent. The cake was really soft and moist and it does not crumble when you cut into it. The frosting/filling is also chocolate but its not too sweet so it goes really well with the semi-bitter chocolate cake. The bitter sweet chocolate cake makes it stand out from other/artificial cake/frosting. \n\nStrawberry cupcake was also really good! The vanilla cupcake is again soft and moist and what I really liked about the cupcake is that you could taste real strawberries in the frosting so you know they dont just add coloring and flavoring to the frosting. There are minute chunks of strawberries in the frosting too. Yum.\n\nTheir cookies are also amazing. Crunchy on the outside but its soft baked on the inside! \n\nI am actually pretty interested to go out to their actual store to try it out.", "author": "Valerie H."}

I came across Susie Cakes while in a cab headed to Smitten Ice Cream, but what's ice cream without cake? My husband and I walked to Susie Cakes from Smitten. I'm totally glad I did. I only tried two items. They both were sooo goood. I got the Chocolate Cookie Whoopie Pie and the Green Velvet Mini. I love Red Velvet Cake so this was as close as possible. They had Red Velvet by the slice but I didn't want that much cake. The green Velvet Mini was very good and moist. You can tell they use oil in making this cupcake which helps keep the moisture. The frosting to me tasted more like a butter cream and I'm not a fan of butter cream. It was like a cream cheese butter cream. I like straight cream cheese frosting. I'm a big fan of Great American Cookie Company and the Chocolate Cookie tasted like the chocolate cookie from Great American Cookie Company. They have the best cookies and this cookie reminded me of them. This cookie was thick, moist and soft. They only thing is it could have used some chocolate chucks to give it some crunch. Other than that this cookie is the bomb. Very good. \n\nLike I said, I only tried 2 items but they were good and I loved them. Overall, a good bakery and a must try.", "author": "Tiffany D."}

We had the opportunity to try different butter creams, cupcakes, cakes, and other sweet desserts. An ipad with photo samples also helped with selecting a design. A mock cake was also available to reference for size. Park promptly sent an email the next day to confirm our selections and delivery date. I can't wait until my wedding at the end of the month so I can turn all my friends and family to Susiecake addicts! \n\nWe selected a 3 tier (red velvet, celebration cake, 6 layer chocolate covered with vanilla buttercream) and a full red velvet sheet cake with cream cheese frosting to accommodate ~200 guests with a delivery fee of $40.

In the past, it was mainly to catch a great movie at the Cinema 21, have deep dish pizza at the City's original Uno's on Lombard, or enjoy a post softball game meal at Barney's Burgers or a Mexican place on Chestnut.  On Christmas eve, my friend and I stopped here after an appointment at the neighboring Apple Store (wait, isn't this where the theater was?).  There was a small line around 3 pm as people scrambled to buy last minutes gifts or treats to celebrate the holiday.  \nAfter entering the narrow walkway into the store, my eyes were fixated on the variety of sweets stored in their deliciously tempting display counter.  Not wanting to be bad for the holidays, I limited myself to three items as follows:\n\n1. Tropical cake (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Bdt85fhl96b_e9-bVQF4Kg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - This looks deceivingly plain, but trust me when I say that there is no lack of flavors here.  From the pineapple pieces scattered in the cake to the coconut flakes on the outside, my taste buds were at full blast eating this.\n\n2. Whoopie pie (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&start=1&select=gPV5uygJHL8X47Sl_cBdgA) - Not normally a big fan of this, I enjoyed this generously sized rendition.  Just make sure you have that cup of tea or coffee to wash it down.\n\n3. Snickerdoodle (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=mGyr7sZHZOL22_oOnjcHNA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Solid version, though still hard to beat my favorite at a chain named Baker Street Cookies who served them hot, steamy, and soft.... sigh.\n\nThe counter staff were very cordial, patient, and efficient in preparing and boxing our orders.  After a short wait, we were ready to pay and out of the store.  There were several frazzled customers who seemed lost in trying to pick up their phone orders.  \nI would definitely have that tropical cake again and hope to try their other offerings in the near future.  Just need to make sure there's no physician's checkup or blood tests looming.  \nDon't want my sugar count to fly off the charts!", "author": "Mike C."}

We got an assortment of cupcakes, but since I love strawberry, I decided to try the Strawberry cupcake.\n\nI may anger a lot of Susie Cakes lovers, but I found it to be waaay too sweet. I basically took one bite and threw the rest away. It did have a nice strawberry flavor though. Too bad the sweetness overpowered the strawberry flavor. I know a lot of people like their celebration cake, but if it's as sweet as the strawberry one I had, it's not for me. I prefer lighter frostings and cakes.\n\nIf you're a huge fan of thick sugary icing, then you'll probably like Susie Cakes.

Chances are it's REALLLYYYYY amazing or it's not that great. Unfortunately, this place was just average to me. Susiecakes was brought up by one of my acquaintances who swore it was the best cupcakes ever. Being the cupcake enthusiast that I am, I had this place bookmarked and eyed for the longest time. Finally got to try this 2.5 weeks ago. \n\nBought a box of 4 for $14. $3.50 each cupcake. \nFlavor of the month Strawberry Lemonade: Omg... it was SOOOOOO sour... I cringed. And I LOVE sour. But this was overwhelming and I forcefully downed it since I already paid $3.50 for it. \n\nStrawberry: It consisted of artificial pieces of strawberries in the cupcake itself . This one was alright. I can't put my finger on it, but I didn't really favor this one as much. \n\nRed Velvet: Kind of hard to mess up. The flavors were good, it wasn't too sweet, and the frosting complimented it well. Maybe some technical issues in baking since a lot of the cupcake were completely stuck to the baking cups. \n\nVanilla: Probably my favorite one out of the four. Very basic, but it was the only one that seem to be made correctly. It wasn't too sweet and the frosting was nicely balanced in sweetness with the cake portion. \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/susiecakes-san-francisco?select=_iYAvO7lUeQu7UKuYN6wDQ\n\nOverall, a very average cupcake place.

We called a bunch of cake stores and majority of them were sold out of cakes already. \n\nSusiecakes still had some cakes left so we drove over to the Marina district to pick up one. We opted for the small 6\" marble cake and it costed $36 with an additional $3 for writing...Most cake places provide free cake writing. The 9\" was $49... Super expensive for a basic cake. \n\nWhen it was time to eat it, we were excited but upon consumption we were super disappointed. The marble cake was basically vanilla and chocolate cake swirled with bits of chocolate chips embedded and covered in a chocolate frosting. It was overly sweet and no one expect for my 10 year old brother liked it. You really REALLLYY reallly need to have a major sweet tooth to enjoy their cakes. My mouth/tooth cringes at the thought of how sweet it was. We ended up giving away half of the cake to a homeless man because we didn't want to waste it and that we should share instead of throwing it away in the trash. \n\nTo each their own but in my opinion, even the Whole Foods cakes taste better than the cake we had here. \n\n2 stars because it saved our butts for our Father's day cake but would never come here for a cake ever again.

A few weekends ago, my boyfriend brought me to his favorite cake place (yes, here).  Not that I don't trust his tastes in sweets because he knows his sweets, but I was a bit skeptical that this place have a great red velvet cake.  I mean... come on! It's a SOUTHERN cake and where I'm from (Texas), I've had my share of red velvet cakes! \n\nI didn't eat the cake right away.  I actually waited about 2 days because we have been eating non-stop for the entire weekend.  I had my first bite on the plane en route back to Texas.  Nom... it helped with the screaming kid and toddler around me.  The cake was super moist (even after being a day or two old) and the frosting was the right balance of cream cheese and lightness.  The slice was pretty generous too!  In fact, I ate half on the plane and the rest in my office for lunch the next day. \n\nI think I might have found my favorite red velvet cake place (and yes, I might be replacing Icebox out in Miami, Florida).

I didn't look at it until we took out the cake later for dessert. I was so embarrassed to see how poorly the letters were done - it looked like something I, who has zero experience in this sort of decoration, could have done.  The letters were childish, uneven, and in all caps. They should not have let that cake be sold to us like that.

As a self-taught baker, it's always hard finding a bakery that makes a yummy cream cheese frosting and has the right cake / frosting ratio. SusieCakes it's just the place. My family was on vacation and stumble upon the bakery. We tried several flavors but the carrot cake was my favorite. Moist and delicious. The red velvet was just okay and needed a stronger chocolate taste. The chocolate and chocolate marble was also a huge hit among the family.", "author": "T. Renee D."}

The red velvet and chocolate are traditional, but they do a great job on such typical flavors. The fluffy cake paired with the light fluffy frosting is awesome, beware certain flavors are more sugar potent than others (e.g. confetti cake).\n\nMy only issue is that the mini cupcakes are tiny and expensive (3 for $5), and you can get a hugeeee slice of cake for only $5. Unlike what you would expect, the cake and the cupcake taste quite different - the frosting between layers, and the cake itself is not as fluffy in cake form, so overall, I prefer the large chocolate and red velvet cupcakes because of price and taste over the cake slices and mini cupcakes.", "author": "Jess C."}

I research cupcakes in every city that I have access to (home and frequent travel) and always buy and sample cupcakes in the highest rated places. I am always skeptical and I want real buttercream...don't try to fake me out with some gross frosting made from anything but butter, sugar, vanilla, and salt as the basic ingredients to start a true buttercream. I don't do faux buttercream. I just don't. It's disgusting....so, when I walked into Susiecakes, I inquired if they use real butter in their frosting and was proudly told that they use real ingredients and prepare everything from scratch. ok....still skeptical since I've heard that before...but these looked legit. I purchased two vanilla (one pink, one turquoise) and two coconut. I will attest that they are using real buttercream and the cupcakes were really good. Fresh, moist and just delicious. I've eaten cupcakes from coast to coast and all in between and these are exceptional!  Have I had better? Yes. Have I had worse? Omg, YES! These are probably my number two or three in the history of my cupcake obsession (which is extensive). Definitely worthy and definitely calls for more visits! They had lots of whole cakes that could be purchased by the slice too. Now, I like cake, but I have a special affinity for cupcakes and I didn't purchase individual slices. Cupcakes run about $3.50, which is true and fair for quality cupcakes and I feel that these are worth it.Customer service was very friendly and willing to answer questions.

My fiance and I had a great time tasting all of the flavors, and they let us take the leftovers home.  We picked the carrot cake (Justin's favorite) and tropical coconut cake (my favorite), and because we were expecting about 100 guests, we elected to do a three layer cake and a sheet cake.  We ordered our cakes from the Marin store because it was closer to the our reception location. \n\nThe wedding cake was delicious - it tasted just like the samples.I do have two recommendations:  #1 - These are very dense cakes so you probably don't need to order any extra.  We had a ton of cake leftover.   #2 - because it's buttercream frosting (and not fondant), they can't get too fancy with the cake decorating.  We decided to go with a simple design, and then ordered extra \"cake flowers\" from our florist (for around $40).  We used Farm Girl Flowers (love them!) but they don't send a florist to the reception site, so one of my friends put the cake flowers onto the cake.  It looked fantastic! \n\nOne of the things that I like best about Susie Cakes is that they don't price gauge you just because your cake is for a wedding.

I ordered a 9\" custom layer cake ($49 base price) for a graduation party. I figured it would be nice to have them do some kind of design, since the website photos look so great. It was a law school graduation, so I suggested the scales of justice as the design. I gulped hard when I heard the total for my order: $95 (including tax)!!! The manager explained the breakdown: Although the actual cake is $49, it costs $3 for an inscription and another $38 for a custom design, plus taxes. I rationalized that this was a special event, and it would be worth it. When I picked up the cake, my heart sank. I'm fairly confident I could have done that design myself and saved the extra money. To be fair, they asked me if it looked ok when I picked it up, and I should have said something then, but I was in a rush, with my mother-in-law, and did not want to make a scene. I learned a valuable lesson that day, however, that I figured I would share with the yelp community.\n\n***Update: The manager of this location reached out to discuss my experience.

The cake is about 7 layers, alternating between cake and icing. I prefer icing to cake, but I'd say they were quite evenly distributed - definitely more positive than when it's too cakey. The icing is sweet but not too sweet, to where a lot of people leave it on their plates to the side. \n\nI've never tried cookies, cupcakes, pudding cakes, etc., but all look very tasty as well. My one qualm is the price - it's not cheap for a relatively small cake! But if you're looking for professional and convenient, it's a great go-to.", "author": "Jackie W."}

It's cakes are moist, decadent, and top notch in quality using fresh ingredients and no preservatives. They have several flavors baked regularly such as their super popular vanilla celebration cake complete with sprinkles and teal frosting, old fashioned chocolate, vanilla chocolate chip marble, tropical coconut, carrot, and red velvet. My two favorite are the tropical coconut (with one bite I swear you will be transported to Exotic Cake Island) and the marble cake (chocolate chips are always a good idea!)\n\nThey also offer a variety of other treats like cupcakes (just had the seasonal cupcake for July-blueberry pancake....so freakin goood), whoopie pies, regular mini pies, cookies, and an assortment of bars. Check out their website for custom orders/specialty party cakes. I'm far off from ever getting married but at least I know where I am ordering my cake from. I love you Susie.

Bakers are a dime a dozen in this town.... heh. Susie thinks she's all that and a bag of banana chips, but her chips are stale and the operation makes a pre-school look like a well run corporation. I came in here to buy a bunch of cupcakes at 2:38PM. They have a large selection. Cakes, cookies, cupcakes..... A sugar slut's dream. But here is where it got stupid and weird. I place my order. 3 dozen cupcakes. 4 of every flavor. pretty easy if you think on it for 2 seconds. But chaos reigns in this TINY, tiny, shop. There were 11 employees working and Me at the case..... Just me. Now I understand things can be hectic.... But it was just me.... And the craziness on the baking side of the business looked like 11 crack heads doing the tango. It took them a few minutes just to ask me for my order... Staff are carrying cakes around, bakers are yelling from the back, 3 people are managing phone and internet orders... 3 people? There is NO SYSTEM in PLACE.... NONE. Shit just happens by yelling and moving. Looks like the short order line at lunch in NYC diner. What the hell Susie? Straighten up your bakery. Aren't bakers suppose to be planning, mindful, and precise? Cooks are the messy creative types. We yell, we throw flaming pans across the room into the dish sink, we curse, we are avant guard. We are the Parisian waiters of the kitchen... \"Phufft! I fart in your general direction!\"   But Bakers..... You guys are suppose to be quiet professionals..... souffles ain't shit to you. You work by stopwatches and measure stuff by the micro-gram. Once that oven dings.... Heaven comes out the door. The Zen masters of the kitchen.\n\nBut.... Not.... You... Guys.\n   11 .... Eleven employees. I waited.... I watched... 1 out of the 11. She grabbed some tongs... that she had to search for.... and slowly folded a box..... She.... put.... the.... box... down ....on... the... counter...20 feet ... away from the counter.... and .... transported.... the... cupcakes.... one...at... a... time.... to... the... box.... 36 times.... what... the.... fuck... lady.... It took her 1 minute per cup cake because she had to dodge and cover the cupcake from the other employees squeezing in and out of the counter area......  I was in there for 34 minutes. I was out the door at 3:16. I waited +half-hour to give you guys $123 for 36 cupcakes..... Seriously. I was the first one in the door, and by the time I left the line had grown to the sidewalk. How do 11 employees make such a mess of running things? Did one of you other employees ever think of helping her load the other 2 boxes? No.... You each grabbed a customer and then went off trying to do everything yourself like a bunch of amateurs. First year cooking students have more sense. Team-work makes the dream work. But alas..... you guys will probably keep running around and stick to punishing yourselves like a bunch of flour covered sadists. Where as I will go to Safeway and pile cheap ass cupcakes into my cart, save $100 and retain 34 minutes of my life. I'm not a dessert guy..... And birthday kids don't care where their sugar came from or how much I spent on them. Have fun Susie. You deserve the neighborhood you live in.

I'm a total cupcake whore, so I've tried them all: Magnolia Bakery in NYC, Sprinkles in LA, Crumbs in LA, Kara's Cupcakes in Ghiradelli's Square, Kako all around SF, Teacake Bakeshop in Emeryville, Love at First Bite in Berkeley, etc.  I've been to them all!

From office birthday cakes, to friends birthday cakes, to large-scale orders for events, and random cupcake cravings, the consistently high-quality and helpful, friendly service keeps bringing me back. \n\nFor our most recent Halloween Event I worked with a couple ladies, but with Molly the most - shewas incredibly helpful and didn't bat an eye when I had to almost double my order. Everything arrived exactly on time, as promised. The attendees raved about the cookies and mini cupcakes.\n\nI didn't realize for the longest time that they have a San Francisco location, but knew of the company from Southern California (in fact, my best friend had her wedding cake and bridal shower cake done by the Newport Beach location), and haven't looked back since I found them.\nMy personal favorite is a tie between the Classic Marble and Vanilla Celebration (funfetti) but I'm pretty sure I couldn't say no to anything from SusieCakes.", "author": "Jenna R."}

On that note, there really should be some sort of ticketing system (like Lucca's Delicatessen) to call on who's next.

We ordered red velvet, peanut butter, mocha and a slice of \"Celebration\" cake.\n\nWhat can I tell you except that these were all very ordinary cupcakes.  I've tasted these same cupcakes at least a hundred times over.  Not moist, not flavorful, just a cupcake that you'd get at a birthday party somewhere.  Not trying to be mean, just trying to be real. I don't get what anyone likes about the cupcakes.  The frosting is WAY too sweet and too much butter, leaves a film on my tongue.  Can't handle that kind of frosting.  And even worse, SusieCakes puts extra frosting IN the cupcake. Horror of horrors!  :)  Not good for me at all.\n\nWe all took bites and tossed them.  I know that sounds bad, but we were all very full from lunch and the thought of ingesting all these calories when the cupcakes weren't even good, was a big turnoff for all of us.\n\nMaybe we should have opted for the sllices of the large cakes instead of the cupcakes?  I feel like the coconut cake and the carrot cake might have been good--judging just from the looks. I don't think cupcakes are Susie's strongpoint.

As our goodies were being bagged, an employee informed us that the iced molasses had broken (which was the last one), so he offered us a cookie on him (we picked chocolate chip). \n\nMy snicker doodle was a tad undercooked for my tastes (which my hubby actually loved), and he thought his cookie had too many chocolate chips (I love chocolate, but I also thought it was a bit rich). The peanut butter was a tad bit dry, but had a very nice flavor. \n\nAfter reading the Yelp reviews, it's obvious that we should have tried a slice of the vanilla celebration cake (my hubby's mouth literally dropped open when we saw it).

I was less concerned with how the cakes looked, and more concerned with how they tasted, since so many wedding cakes just don't measure up in the taste department.  Having loved SusieCakes for their delicious cupcakes and other goodies, I could not wait to do my cake tasting with them!\n\nAt our tasting, Megan was extremely helpful and excited about our cake bar idea.  She took down our order of 13 different cakes and all of our information for delivery.  The big day came and all my guests could talk about was the beautiful cake bar which was at the center of our reception (see photo).  When it came time to cut the cakes, everyone was circled around the cake bar ready to jump in and try all the different varieties.  It was a huge hit - and I cannot thank SusieCakes enough for making our vision a reality and for providing our guests with so much variety on our special day!", "author": "Dana H."}

Definitely did not disappoint...the buttercream filling was a tad too sweet for my taste, but OMG, the chocolate cookies itself were both decadent and chewy, with a brownie like texture... divine!  \n\nI've tried several of their cupcakes before from their Brentwood location in the past, but I couldn't help myself from caving into their 3 for $5 mini cupcakes special.  A perfect way to satisfy my cupcake craving without over indulging.  Everyone knows just how much I love red velvet cupcakes and it was no surprise that I bit into that cupcake first.  Sadly, I cannot say SusieCakes' rv was my fav.  Their cream cheese frosting was delicious indeed, tasty and not too sweet, but the cake itself was a bit disappointing.  Although it was very moist, it lacked the cocoa flavor I was looking for and the cake was bright red.  I hate to say this, but it almost tasted like a vanilla cake dyed with red food coloring, just with a cream cheese frosting instead.\n\nNot a bad place to stop by if I'm in the Marina area, but I think I'll opt for the cookies + bars vs. the cupcakes option next time.", "author": "Janetto L."}

I have been here more times than you and had most of their cakes and they have a consistent product. Its not dry. You suck.\n\nI can understand the complaint of it being too sweet. That's legitimate. I'd prefer it a little less sweet but its not 'too' sweet for me.\n\nIts not my favorite cake but its very good. And I appreciate the quality of cake it is. I once bought a mini-cake and had them write a personalized message on it. Understandably expensive but an easy process. In and out in less than 10 minutes. \n\nI love their seasonal cupcake. They had a blueberry pancake one once that was outstanding. \n\nChocolate chip cookie is also great.

She completely agrees and enjoys the lemon cupcake which is so tasty and refreshing.\n\nI think the lady and I have probably been back to Susiecakes more then 10 times since my first endeavor.  Each time we've purchased something, whether it was a birthday cake, cupcakes for our cheat days, or most recently, a 7 layer bar (which are to die for!) we have never been disappointed!\n\nThankfully my sister and her fianc\u00e9 picked Susiecakes to host their wedding cake bar!

Never have I seen a more cheerful team of blissed out bakers. They must be sugar high; every time I go in they welcome me with wide eyes, a free sample, and a smile. \n\nWedding season was my first introduction to the taste of Susie Cakes and since then they have become a tried and true favorite. I love their Celebration Cake (who doesn't?), sugar cookies, and mini-cupcake treats. I have found every sweet produced by the bakery to be \"rant and rave\" fabulous . Even though the french macaron will always be my #1 go to treat.... Susiecakes makes for a delicious runner-up sugar fix. HANDS DOWN the best part about the business is their customer service. Warm, welcoming, and instantly charming, the Susie Cakes attitude makes the bakery a \"Dessert Disneyland\" for visitors.  Its a smart business strategy for when your smiling, sweets taste much sweeter leave you wanting more. In the end it works out well for us all! \n\nFeeling like a kid again isn't a bad thing.... \"its a small world after all\". Treat yourself with a visit to the \"Happiest Bakery On Earth\".

He said he wanted chocolate chocolate cake, so I thought, why not?\n\nFor those folks complaining about the heavy richness, or the sugarbomb overdose, you clearly were not attending to the marketing.  SusieCakes is very clear- both at the shop and online- that they create good old fashioned, all-American baked goods with the highest quality ingredients.  If you are looking for some new-fangled, lightly sugared and delicately balanced confection, this is not the place.  Susie cakes creates that insanely rich, butter-based, Ghiradelli-chocolate-infused, why...please....WHY can't I STOP stuffing my face kind of cake.  \n\nTalking 'bout this cake was sitting on the kitchen counter the day before my birthday, and I refused to resist the throwback urge to claw at the tape keeping the box closed, attack that mofo with my greedy claw and pound that puppy into my eager mouth.  The smell was intoxicating and the frosting was immaculate.\n\nTalking 'bout this cake took a slam at a just-too-late red light and went from the seat to the floor of the car slingshot style.  Not only did it survive, but the frosting that got on the inside of the thick box top had leeched its buttery footprint onto the top of the thick box top within a matter of hours.  Thassome REAL buttercream frosting.\n\nTalking 'bout they CALL you the day after you get the cake to ask you how you enjoyed it and if there is anything they can do to make your cakey experience more pleaasurable.\n\nThere is a reason why SusieCakes locations are found only in places like Menlo Park, the Marina, and Beverly Hills.  Rich folks wanna get they cake  on, and they're willing to pay the price for some classic, simple, high-quality delectability.

Their cakes, like their cupcakes, are delicious and extremely moist. And their cake decorating is pretty impressive too! Photos of some of their designs have made their way on to my Facebook page, because they're just that cool.\n\nThe cupcakes are a highlight for me, though.

Susie Cakes has the best marble cake, EVER. It's so yummy, moist, and not too sweet. The frosting isn't overpowering and is the right texture. I'm glad I only got 1 slice, because I probably could eat a whole cake by myself. Definitely my new favorite bakery in the city!", "author": "Diana P."}

I love this bakery and when I lived over seas in Asia, would seek out the nearest SusieBakery when i traveled back to California.  I was able to have the deliver to my hotel in Santa Monica from their Brentwood Bakery.    I have recently moved back to the bay area and visit the Menlo Park or SF location once a week.  I have a SC addiction and would probably visit more if I could.  \n\nHere are some of my favorites :\n\n1. A slice of the  Chocolate cake...Chocolate Heaven is the best description.  OMG, its super moist and the right deep chocolate taste.\n\n2. A slice of the Celebration Cake..never too old for this sweet cake that makes me feel 16 again.\n\n3. Peanut Butter Nutter...Peanut Butter sandwich cookie between a heap of pb buttercream frosting.  Get in my Belly !\n\n4.  Mini chocolate cupcake and Mini vanilla cupcakes...Never too guilty to eat more then one since they are the perfect \"cupcake decision maker\"...I eat them to decide on what dessert I will eat next!\n\n5.   Seven  Layer Bar - Nice with a cup of coffee.  Great the next day even or forgotten in the fridge for a couple days...When you reunite with this 7 layer bar, happiness is all over your smile.\n\n6.  Good 'ol Chocolate chip cookie - the perfect marriage of chewy brown sugar texture and yummy brown buttered gooooodness.  The perfect companion as you drive home.  Hits the right spot and oh so soft and yummy.\n\n7. Banana pudding with nilla wafers. - Better then mom ever made.\n\n8.  Lemon Squares - the lemon curd is a knock our success .  Great for the pucker up!\n\n9.  Pumpkin Pie - All the right spices and nothing short.\n\nMy go-to's are the mini chic cup cake and vanilla mini cupcakes, nutter butters and chocolate chip cookies.  I promise you will want to go back to try more then what you take home on your visit.", "author": "Sandra L."}

I've been meaning to stop in for quite some time now, and finally came around to making it in today.  I ordered a vanilla and red velvet cupcake.  Both are really delicious.  Just the right amount of sweetness (maybe bordering on a little too much, but hey, these are cupcakes).\n\nOn some cupcakes, the icing and the cake aren't really a complementary affair, they just seem to be arbitrarily matched together.

I LOVE IT.\n\nWhat makes a great cupcake is the mastery of both the cake as well as the icing. I love some bakeries for their icing and some for their cake. However, SusieCakes has perfected both - the cake part is moist, fluffy and soft while the icing part is creamy, buttery and sweet without being overbearing.\n\nI highly recommend the notorious red velvet and the slightly less-publicized vanilla cream cupcake. They also have them in cake form in both small and large sizes. I've bought some for mother's day and birthdays before and they have served as a unanimous, surefire hit!\n\nSo definitely stop by SusieCakes in the Marina to quench your cupcake lust or satiate several guests' cravings with some delicious cake. \n\nHappy Eating, Yelpers!", "author": "Priya S."}

The only place you really taste the coconut is the coconut flakes on top of the icing, and maybe a hint in the icing.

The Whoopie Pie was a signature item, so that helped me to make my choice. It was basically two big chocolate cookies, and delicious ones at that, and sandwiched between was a layer of a white buttercream frosting that wasn't overly sweet, but will definitely satisfy your sweet tooth. \nWhile I highly recommend the two treats that we ordered, there are TONS of other cupcakes, cookies, etc. to choose from-everyone will definitely find something yummy here!", "author": "Brianna B."}

That is pretty pricey if you ask me....but hey, this bakeshop is in the Marina so expensive prices are expected. For the price we paid, I think we have had better (and more) baked goods from other shops.\n\nThe Whoopee pie is really sweet but I like theirs better than Teacakes Bakery. I like how the cookie is crunchy in the outside but soft in the middle. I have tried whoopee pies where the cookies are stiff like Oreos which is why I like theirs the best. The cream filling is smooth and it helps tone down the strong chocolate flavor of the cookie.\n\nThe sweet tart (heart shaped turnover) was not fluffy and was kind of chalky.  I would have liked it better if there was more of the fruit filling. I liked the browned crust with the sugar sprinkled all over the top.  It gives it that sugary crunch which I like in desserts.\n\nThe almond joy cake (my favorite out of the three items we bought) is super moist and tastes exactly like the candy. The chocolate icing has a really smooth texture and I really like the almond bits. The cake had just the right amount of sweetness and I like the frosting embedded in the middle of the cake.\n\nThe ladies at the counter were very friendly and were helpful in making recommendations.  Next time, I want to try their Red Velvet...it looks like it's a Sheeple approved item and maybe they're right.", "author": "Shirleyanne A."}

The shop is small and very cute. There were tons of things in the case that were appealing, but I had to remind myself that I was a few hours away from heading home.\n\nThe lady working behind the counter was fabulous and agreed that the banana pudding I was tempted to buy for my husband wouldn't hold up without refrigeration (note to self for next time). I ended up getting a banana cupcake, a molasses cookie and a snicker doodle. The cupcake and doodle were taken home to the family and I nibbled on the molasses cookie while strolling down the street. \n\nI have to give this place great credit for a fabulous molasses cookie. It was soft where it should have been and crisp in the right places. The flavor was spot on and the drizzle of frosting was perfect. I truly appreciated the cookie being called the right thing as well as I am tired of molasses cookies being labeled as \"ginger cookies\" elsewhere. Truly a great cookie and I think I smiled a little more with every bite. \n\nTo be honest, I wish I hadn't gotten the cupcake or that I had eaten it soon after purchasing as the frosting got shifted and a little too warm by the time I got home. We all agreed it had more texture of a muffin than a cupcake but the flavor was good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-08-07", "description": "Finally! My first review!! After much consideration of who was going to be my first, I decided on SusieCakes. Now let me tell you why....\n\nSusieCakes is amazing. Amazing doesn't do it it justice. It's more amazing plus phenomenal plus decadent with a hint of OMG. I have yet to have something I didn't like there and I have tried many things.  SusieCakes is my weakness. I can't walk by and not stop in. And it's impossible to only get one thing. The hardest part is limiting to get only two things. \n\nThe Cupcakes:\nFor me, it's all about the icing. And their icing is perfect. It's fluffy but not so fluffy that it's like eating air. And there's a good scoop of icing but not too much that's it's all you taste. But in my opinion the best part is the tiny bit of icing that's piped into the cupcake itself so no matter what angle you bite into, you get a perfect mixture of cake and icing.  The red velvet isn't too decadent that you have a stomach after. The chocolate is relish but my personal favorite and go-to cupcake is the vanilla. And I'm not a vanilla kinda girl but it's so good I can't not get it. \n\nThe whoopie pies. Now I've never had a whoopie pie elsewhere but all future whoopie pies will be judged open this masterpiece. The cookie is so soft and moist and the cream is so perfectly fluffy and not too sweet. The best part, when you take a bite, the cream stays in place. Nothing irks me more than taking a bite and then all of the insides spewing out of the cookie.  It's stays nice and even while eating the whole thing.  \n\nI can go on and on talking about all the different things I've tried there but one last thing.  The mini pies. I've had one of their berry crumbles which was perfect. I heated it up in the oven and oh my gawd. Wow. The crumble crust. No words can describe how good it is. And then the key lime pie. The crust. The meringue. I'm drooling just thinking about it. \n\nAll and all, if you're walking by SusieCakes and are debating whether or not to go in, do you and your stomach a favor. Don't question. Just go in. Good luck trying to decide what to get, but don't worry, no matter what you get, you'll be happy.", "author": "Sabrina D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-05-16", "description": "2.5 Stars: This bakery is pretty ordinary.  I had passed by here, heard good things (had several friends order cakes/cupcakes for birthdays) and stopped in once for a red velvet cupcake, which was good (not dry like many cupcake places, but rich).  So I decided to order a cake for my boyfriend's birthday.  I decided on the 6\" classic marble cake since he isn't a fan of red velvet/cream cheese frosting (what a freak!).  I ordered over the phone as I hadn't seen the order form online.  I asked a few questions about the cake which I had not found on their menu.  The woman I spoke with was very nice and helpful.  I was slightly disappointed to find that the \"Happy Birthday\" was written on the side of the cake. This is not something it says on their menu (only on the online order form) and I was not informed of this over the phone.\n\nBeing a baker myself, I really wasn't impressed by the cake.  The buttercream frosting was good but overly sweet and the cake was overly rich/dense.  I understand that SusieCakes is going for that homemade look/taste but I was pretty disappointed with the way the cake looked.  You can still do the homemade thing and make it more professional.  The frosting looked good/average but the marbling was very messy looking (YES I understand it is a marbeled cake but the layers looked sloppy).  Very average cake decor, I would expect much better for a bakery that specializes in cakes/cupcakes.\n\nOverall for $36 for a 6\" cake, I found it pretty overpriced/average quality.  I was told a 6\" cake (as the menu doesn't say how many layers) would feed 4-6.  For 4 people, that's $9/slice which seems pretty outrageous to me when it was a basic cake I could have made at home.  Now this would be 4 VERY large slices but even if you consider a 6\" cake feeds 6 people, this still seemed overpriced to me.  Susiecakes appears to be a good bakery to order custom cakes (the pictures online are impressive) but for your average birthday cake, you won't find anything spectacular/unique about this place.  I would go elsewhere.", "author": "Devin W."}

The best cupcakes ever, in my mind, will be Crumbs Cupcakes. That being said, I think that the cupcakes from SusieCakes Bakery offer a nice cupcake if you want a simple and traditional cupcake. \n\nThese remind me of the cupcakes at Kara's Cupcakes. However, they are $0.25 cheaper. I chose my standard choice for cupcake tasting: a vanilla cupcake with vanilla frosting. I bought the one with Tiffany Blue icing. SusieCakes, you get points for dying the frosting to be my favorite color.\n\nAlthough these cupcakes are a traditional size, something that IS innovative about this cupcake is the fact that they add a little dollop of frosting IN the cupcake. It's not a \"frosting filled\" cupcake-- as how they advertise it but, instead, it offers a little creamy frosting on the inside so the cake doesn't become too monotonous.\n\nThe cake, at first bite, was pretty moist. However, I found it to be a little dry as I started to eat more of the cupcake. I believe the top was more moist because of the frosting. The frosting was not overly sweet and it did have a nice texture. My favorite part was the frosting (and the color)!\n\nSusieCakes Bakery is very cute, but it's small!

(see picture). it tasted like we were eating a slice of birthday frosting. was there supposed to be light spongy cake somewhere?\n\n3. the worst part was the OVERWHELMINGLY sweet butter frosting. i love sprinkles cupcakes so theres nothing wrong with sweet frosting. but this was just way too much of it, everywhere. i dont know that anyone in the office finished their slice. had the frosting been light or milder in flavor, maybe the cake would have worked even with 6 layers. definitely not the case here.\n\n4. lastly, it was a funfetti cake, which was delicious. but since the cake was sliced down so much to near nothingness, the green frosting mixed with all of the funfetti spots and the whole inside of the cake was a slightly odd, ugly color of mush.\n\n:( \n\ni hope no one has to have a 'cake' like this again. i did not order this cake but i suggest against it, or specify less layers/lighter on the frosting.", "author": "bonnie y."}

They bake on site and everything's made from scratch.\n\nThe cases are filled with layer cakes, cookies, pudding, cheesecake, bars, whoopie pies and brownies.  It looks like an old fashioned, retro bake shop (reminds me of Magnolia Bakery).  Their frosting filled cupcakes have a homestyle look.  They had about 12 kinds of full size cupcakes (coconut, strawberry, peanut butter, lemon, vanilla, chocolate, chocolate mint, etc.), no minis, $3 each.  They also have cute letterpress greeting cards.  \n\n* Strawberry cupcake ($3): the vanilla cake is tender, dense, heavier than usual, it goes well with their thick, smooth frosting.  The pretty pink frosting was very sweet but also tart - it smelled just like a strawberry lollipop (I kept the bag just to sniff, I would wear that scent).  I wish they put it in a box instead of a bag.  I think there's too much frosting.  The cupcake (frosting and cake) is very heavy, rich and dense.\n\n* Molasses cookie with vanilla frosting drizzle ($2): Big, thick soft cookie, with plenty of cloves, cinnamon, molasses.  It was good, cake like, not that special though.\n\nWhat I really like about this place is that you can get cake slices ($5.50).  \n\nSaturday (June 26) they'll have their grand opening/sock hop celebration from 2 - 5 PM with 50's music, activities for the kids, prizes and tasty free treats.", "author": "Lolia S."}

We had been looking for a dessert place for a while, and when I spotted SusieCakes', I practically drooled with excitement, especially when I saw several people sitting in front with huge cake boxes. The two small tables in the front are a good place to sit and enjoy your treats, as well as the weather, which was nice that day (7-25-11).\n\nThe selection for treats and cupcakes wasn't as large as I expected, but it wasn't bad, either. I noticed immediately the Blueberry Pancake cupcakes, which surprised me, the chocolate chip cookies, and the Sweetie Pies and Sweetheart cookies, which all looked yummy. The cakes on display had me wishing that it was my birthday so that I could have an excuse to buy one; they looked lovely and delicious.\n\nAfter pondering for a few minutes about what to get, my friend decided on the Neopolitan cookie and I grabbed a Whoopie Pie and Red Velvet cupcake to go (I was saving them to share with my family).\n\nMy first bite of the cupcake had me reeling with delight. Instant 4 stars - it was fluffy, moist, and not too sweet, which is an issue I've had with many a cupcake. The frosting was a bit sugary but it was a lovely accent to its red, cakey counterpart. The batter wasn't too red as well; I find the rich, deep red of usual Red Velvet's disconcerting, as they hint of a bit too much food coloring, so I was very pleased with this cake's shade :)\n\nI would go back for the cupcakes, but I'm not sure if I could say the same about the Whoopie Pies. I found it much too sweet and rich, and though I'm glad they don't skimp on the vanilla buttercream, it overwhelmed the taste of the chocolate cookies sandwiching it, which I think I might have enjoyed more on their own. It's definitely too much richness to eat alone, or maybe even to split, without suffering from a dessert coma, but eating a small portion is fine.\n\nI am a big fan of good service, and this place was definitely friendly, though perhaps a bit too much? My friend and I were asked three times if we would like to order in the span of the few minutes we were in there, and I felt a little embarrassed for taking so long. Perusing the options in peace would've been nice, especially since there was no line waiting, but I did appreciate that the staff was attentive.\n\nI would still recommend SuzieCakes' Red Velvet cupcakes, which is one of their most popular  treats, but the rest I'll have to recommend if/when I return!", "author": "Tina Y."}

I have yet to get something i don't like, which is rare because I feel like most bakeries have a standout item and everything else is just mediocre.\n\ncupcakes: I usually get their mini cupcakes and have tried the vanilla, chocolate and red velvet. all are yummy, but i like the red velvet the most. they aren't too sweet and it's a perfect amount of frosting.  they are moist and a perfect texture.\n\ncakes: i've had the celebration cake and it really reminds me of a gourmet version of a betty crocker cake. i know it doesn't do the cake justice at all, but it really tastes a lot like betty crocker type of cake but 100 times better! it's really pretty (many layers, beautiful pale green frosting with confetti in the cake) and fun to look at too!  i've also had the strawberry shortcake which is amazing - the perfect mix of cake, fruit and cream.  the chiffon cake is so light and moist and the cream isn't overly heavy. such a yummy combination.\n\npie: i just had the key lime pie and it was soooo delicious. i love pie crusts and this graham pie crust is to die for (I think it's either graham or cookie crust).  The filling is a perfect tartness and creaminess and combined with the crust just makes every bite heavenly (I got the mini-pie so there was lots of crust)\n\nWalking into the bakery just makes me happy. it's a modern retro decor and everything just looks so good. i can't wait to try more of their treats!\n\nOverall, I think this is your all-american bakery rather than a french patisserie.

If you want moist cakes in traditional flavors, seasonal cupcakes, whoopie pies and sweetie pies then this place should satisfy your sweet tooth.\n\nThe +'s\n+ Reception is friendly and prompt. Have your order ready or step aside for those who are ready.\n+ Glass cases are replete with cupcakes in mini and regular ($3) sizes. Consider strawberry, chocolate mint, mocha and the seasonal ones such as blueberry pancake batter cupcakes which are divine! They taste like raw batter but it's safe and fun to eat. Packed with blueberries!\n+ Buttercream frosting is really good but can be slathered on a bit thick for my taste. No biggie. Just scrape it off to your liking.\n+ Cakes are moist and fresh. Personal favorite is the marble cake which is a mixture of chocolate and vanilla--accented with chocolate chip morsels! Others include red velvet, carrot and tropical coconut. 6\" and 9\" rounds go for $33 and $46 respectively.\n+ Can't eat the whole thing then get a slice ($5.50) which is quite a generous slab.\n+ Sweetie pies are heart shaped mini pies filled with seasonal fruit. They run $5.50 and are a great alternative to those who are not the cake types.\n+ Custom cake orders are welcomed. Check their work in the glass cases and the photo gallery online. I had a marble cake frosted in pink and white. Came out beautifully!\n\nThe -'s:\n- Seasonal cupcake flavors don't last. Sigh. \n- Wish they had coffee from Blue Bottle to pair with my sweet cravings\n- No seating area to enjoy your sugar high.\n\nThe TIPS *:\n* If you are into the seasonal cupcake beware that the flavor will change monthly and end a few days before the first of the next month.\n* Get on the email list and you will get a free cupcake on your birthday!\n* Consider having your cake decorated with fondant designs at etsy.com.

Only one time did I have someone serve me that wasn't as nice.  SusieCakes always offers little tasters which is generous & a great way to find what you like.\n\nI really respect that they are very open to feedback.  Apparently they are always tweaking their recipes which shows that they are committed to making their cakes as yummy as possible.\n\nMy only suggestion is to change the frosting on the Tropical Coconut Cake.  I think it's way too sweet and overpowers the coconut & pineapple.  This cake is so beautifully made and has such wonderful ingredients and moistness, but I couldn't taste the coconut or pineapple nearly enough and would rather have those flavors dominate the cake.  The frosting should only complement the cake and not be overpowering so it needs to be much more subtle in my opinion.

The flavor of the month isn't usally special - and Red Velvet is something many places in the bay have *mastered* so you won't be blown away as much.  The chocolate mainline stuff is great...but 3rd place here.\n\n2.) The side snacks are bomb diggity.. 7 layer bar, peanut butter cookie whoopie.. might be the best Suzie got.\n\nCons - blue barn next door has better coffee imo, and Suzie cakes is weird not to list a price anywhere in the store...

Unfortunately, the staff was reluctant to follow the clearly posted instructions and made up fictional reasons to not give a cookie that was clearly earned. The staff said that in order to qualify you must be in grades K-8 and that high school or above does not matter. This is not stated anywhere in the store. It was clearly a fabricated lie in order for the staff to not give a free cookie. \nAlso, I am not sure if Susie Cakes is only supposed to serve freshly baked cupcakes; if they are they are going against their word, and if they are not then they are serving day old cupcakes to paying customers. Either way, I am extremely disappointed with the San Francisco Susie Cakes. Additionally, the staff took some of the cupcakes from the display and proceeded to eat them, without paying, in front of the store window.

The cakes were dry and tasteless. Really the only sweet thing was the icing on the cake. I had the carrot cake and my girlfriend had the chocolate cake, we also got a rice crispy. The lady that worked there said the rice crispy was the best treat in the shop but it was sour and stale I honestly recommend the Kellogg rice krispie and Dunken Hines over Susie cakes any day.", "author": "michael h."}

Fortunately for me, my coworker was persistent on my hosting a gathering at my place.  I thought \"Perfect!\" I hadn't stopped ranting and raving about how great it tastes.  I decide to buy a small cake in lieu of a few slices of the larger version.  Absolutely ecstatic, I bring the cake home and wait for dinner to be over to bring it out.  To my slight dismay, it didn't have the same orgasmic impact as the first time I had it.  However, needless to say, every one that it was amazing.  After analyzing it a bit, I realized that the cake to frosting ratio was different in the two sizes.  The smaller version has a bit too much frosting for my taste.  It overpowers the lusciousness of the cake.  This cake is still #1 in my book!  \n\nSide note: I tried a mini red velvet.  In my honest opinion, it is a little flavorless; it is akin to edible playdoh.  Will not purchase again.", "author": "Rachel B."}

Second, they didn't have ANY of their seasonal cupcakes out AND they said that if we wanted a piece of chocolate peppermint cake, we would have to let it sit out 2 hours before eating it. I drove an hour to the city specifically for these items, which you would expect would be available since they are in high demand. As for the peppermint cake, which we obviously couldn't wait two hours to try, it was good, but not my favorite layer cake.

I was in total vapor lock as to what to get, there were at least 5 things I felt like i couldnt live without. I ended up going with the peanut butter whoopie pie. seriously to die for.

I enjoyed visiting your shop, and singing along to Barry White with your employees.  For my complimentary birthday cupcake, I chose the peanut butter, which is my favorite (second to the coconut).  The cake is a rich chocolate and the hat, as I like to call it, was a tasty peanut butter cream that complimented it perfectly.  \n\nYou scored the double play last week.  On Friday, it was also my wife's birthday.  We hosted a soiree at our place, and went full tilt with the 9\" Red Velvet.  In our E-vite, we billed this as \"the best cake in town,\" and feared that perhaps one guest might dissent.  However, when the oversized 3 and 0 candles were blown out, we found smiles all around the room.  The moist red chocolatey cake combined with sinful cream cheese frosting was beyond reproach.  If I had one complaint, it would be that we all slipped into food coma after I got a little too generous with the portions.  \n\nAnd then we had cake for breakfast the next day.  Still good.  Suzie, my wife loves you and I can't argue with her.  \n\nThank you again,\n\nChad", "author": "Chad K."}

There are a few others left in their dust who I no longer even bother visiting since SusieCakes opened.  There are certain thing I like about both Kara's and SusieCakes, and I still patronize both- however I find myself at SusieCakes just a bit more these days when I am in the mood for something sweet.  Here is my analysis-\n\nBoth places are great, both are in the same price range, and both give me cavities and make me fat.  The cupcakes at each place are always fresh, moist and outstanding, and really the preference comes down to what you as an individual prefer.  If you like vanilla- then Kara's is the place for you- I have never had a better vanilla than their 'sweet vanilla'.  Kara's also has a great meyer lemon cupcake as well.  If you like red velvet (one of my personal favorites)- then SusieCakes wins- their red velvet is the best of show amongst the local competitors, and beyond that I do not believe Kara's even makes one?  Other delicious varieties I have enjoyed at SusieCakes include a white-chocolate strawberry, a peanut-butter and jelly, and a blueberry variation.  I enjoy their creamier frosting a bit more than Kara's as well.  Both places have 'mini' cupcakes as well to suffice that market need....\n\nBeyond all of this, I have grown to really appreciate and consistently order some of their non-cupcake items- they feature a variety of cookies and cakes and other goodies as well- and unless I am mistaken Kara's only features cupcakes (and coffee...).  My favorite non-cupcake item is the 'Susie's Nutty' sandwich cookie which features two peanut-butter cookies with a peanut butter cream in the middle- excellent.  Maybe my favorite thing at their store? Aside from this location, I have also visited a Marin location of theirs ironically just after visiting my dentist in Greenbrae- and everything is basically the same if not identical to the Chestnut Street spot.\n\nIn summary, while I am not exclusively loyal to SusieCakes, I am definitely a big fan and I will surely be a consistent future patron of theirs until my teeth rot out and my cholesterol level reaches critical mass :-)", "author": "Andy S."}

But I left all my inhibitions at the door and decided to try SusieCakes for their cupcakes. \n\nThis review is about their cupcakes only. That's the only thing I've tried so far but their cakes look delicious! I'm going to have to pick up a slice of carrot cake for pops on his birthday. \n\nTheir cupcakes are filled with frosting but it's not too much. Probably just a little dallop. I picked up a regular sized mocha cupcake for $3 and three mini cupcakes for $5 total: red velvet, chocolate, and vanilla. \n\nMOCHA - Um, it tasted exactly like the chocolate cupcake. What happened to a slight hint of coffee?? No where to be found :(\n\nRED VELVET - Probably the best red velvet I tried in the city!\n\nVANILLA - Standard. Nothing to rave about.\n\nCHOCOLATE - Standard. Nothing to rave about.\n\nOne thing that bothers me is that they don't have boxes for one cupcake. So if you buy 1 cupcake, you're stuck with it in a paper bag. Classy? I think not. Aside from asethetics, the cake is pretty moist and their cupcakes have a homemade feel to it. \n\nI'll give SusieCakes another try in the near future because I still want to try their lemon cupcake as well as their carrot cake.

I've found that anytime I'm remotely anywhere near the vicinity, I somehow find myself walking through the door excited to taste another bit of deliciousness!  \n\nThe thing that I love best is that you can get a few mini cupcakes (3 for $5) if you want just a little something sweet or you can splurge and get a regular-sized cupcake.  We've often picked up a dozen for dinner gatherings because it gives everyone the chance to try something different (instead of our having to eat the same type of cake).  \n\nI usually don't even want to try red velvet cupcakes at bake shops because they are always underwhelming but the ones at Susie Cakes are THE BEST!!!!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-06-28", "description": "SUMMARY.\nDoes the marina really need another cupcakerie? No, but this place is different.  This place sells various childhood baked goodies that are oldies but goodies from simpler times.  No fancy fondant, crazy piping, or herby flavors or futuristic decor.  Reminds me of magnolia on bleeker.  Cupcakes here are $3 each, generally dense/heavy (not my favorite texture), but flavorful.  Some flavors  need work. I'll be back to check up on them.  Nice, welcoming service.\n\nDISPLAY:\nLike old school places, stuff is on baking sheets/trays. Like they just took em out of the oven.  It feels like a bakery, not a \"boutique\" cupcakerie.\n\nCUPCAKES:\nIn general, cupcakes w/a vanilla cake were super dense, but not dry.  They were heavy and not \"springy\".   I guess this is a dense cupcake done right, whereas American Cupcake is a dense cupcake done wrong.  So, if you like light fluffy cakes, you might not like these.  Personal preference. Also, they \"fill\" all their cupcakes with a tiny bit of frosting.  I personally didn't like this. But to each his own.\n\nThe 4 cupcakes I tried:\n1. Vanilla (vanilla cake w/vanilla buttercream frosting)- cake had good vanilla flavor. A bit dense for my preference.  Frosting: reminded me of magnolia, from the pale pastel colors to the simple spatula-spread frosting (no fancy piping of frosting or strange, round domes a a la kara's). Sometimes, simple is good.  \n\n2. \"Seasonal\"  (vanilla cake w/strawberries baked into it; white chocolate frosting).   This is like a strawberry muffin, with nice pieces of strawberries.  If you let this one sit too long before eating, I can see how the moisture from the strawberries would make the cupcake too soggy.  Cupcake had good flavor, not too sweet.  White chocolate buttercream frosting was delicious.  Not a frosting I see at other palaces.  I think cream cheese would have been good too. Or a strawberry buttercream.  Just suggesting...\n\n3. \"Lemon\" (vanilla cake w/lemon frosting).  This was just ok--needs more work to elevate the lemon flavor.   The lemon frosting tasted like a cross between lemon curd and the jelly in a lemon donut. It didn't stand out like I'd imagine lemony flavored things to do so.  The texture of the frosting could be revamped too--it was also a mix of a buttercream /jelly in jelly donut.  I really wish the cake itself was lemon!  Right now, the frosting must carry the weight of the lemon flavor and it's just not there yet.  How about adding lemon zest to the frosting or cake? \n\n4. \"Peanut Butter\" (Chocolate cake w/PB butercream frosting).  Cake: after plowing through 3 dense vanilla cakes, i expected the same of the chocolate cupcake.  Yet, this cupcake was light and spongy, it actually tasted kind of like it came out of a box.  The frosting was delicious!\n\nThey also have cookies, cake slices. Other cupcake flavors: mint, red velvet (can't believe i didn't get this!!!), chocolate, mocha, coconut.\n\nIf I'm in the hood, I might be back. Density-wise, I like Kara's better.\n\nRANDOM:\nAnybody else think the name of this place sounds like it's the sequal to Boogie Nights?", "author": "Caroline I."}

I like green monkeys - 5 stars! I hate green monkeys, because the killed my penguins, but I respect their quality - 2 stars!\n\nSusieCakes is an offshoot of the LA SusieCakes. Know it!\n\nEveryone is comparing it to Kara's. I tried a big old slice of chocolate fudge cake. I thought they'd cut it thin, so that it would have about the same mass as a cupcake. (I go by mass.) It was a big old honkin' slab o' cake, though, and it went for 6 bucks. Basically 3 cupcakes worth. I thought it was really good. My wife scorned me for buying a huge slab o' cake. I washed the scorn down with 1000 calories of chocolate cake.\n\nMy wife, however, had different ideas. She's a consummate cupcake idealist. An amazing baker, she's the type to dismiss some of the best cupcakes the world has ever seen, dumping them in the trash, frowning, and mumbling, \"something is lacking,\" while a host of shocked little kids hold each other, rocking, mouths agape and eyes wrapped in misery. \n\nThe dryness of the vanilla cupcakes, which other yelpsters called \"cornbread-like,\" didn't do it for her. I recommended eating some of the frosting in the same bite as the cake. She called that idea, \"a crutch for the unimaginative.\" She then blithely tossed it at my ear. I was driving down Bush, dodging texting cabbies and peripatetic buses. I was thinking about chocolate cake. \n\nKara's isn't going to like the competition, but they are still better. Of course, the lack of red velvet is an issue, but they are a whole step above this cute little shop. Perhaps it is unnecessary. Perhaps it will keep Kara from resting on her laurels.

It was the strawberry seasonal cupcake this month. MMMMmmm...very good. I think this is my favorite! It was perfect...not overloaded too much with the strawberry flavor.

All the parking around here is based on expensive meters.  A quarter per 15 minutes? jeez. \n\nI bought the mini cupcakes which had about 4 different flavors- I got red velvet and chocolate there was also vanilla and something else too.   I kind of wish there were different options for the mini cupcakes because  I didn't want to get a regular size one.

Had the red velvet while sitting outside -- too delicious -- the cream cheese frosting was deliciously sweet, yet enough tartness to make it sure it wasn't cloyingly sweet.  The red velvet cake was moist and light -- not heavy, dry or overly crumbly.  Orange creamsicle was good -- but not as good as the red velvet -- the icing had an orange flavor (extract, not zest), and the cake, though moist, was more dense.\n\nHours later -- will update as we eat the various flavors.  So far, so good!  \nOne note -- for all of the cupcakes, there is a nice balance btwn the icing and the cake -- they (so far) all work well together, but you need both of them to get the complete picture, as you should have to.  Neither the icing nor the cake dominates the flavor and texture -- they work and play well with the other.  If you're looking for 2\"+ of icing on top of your cake, this is not your place.\n\nDay Two:  Just had the chocolate mint cupcake & it is the best so far -- the mint icing is minty & sweet but very well balanced -- not too sweet or too minty, with just a hint of crust on the icing.  The chocolate cupcake is the best yet -- very moist and crumbly, yet not dry or dense at all (even on day two).  There was a slight indentation in the cupcake with the icing piped into the hole -- created the perfect ratio of cake to icing in each bite.\n\nCoconut cupcake was also delicious -- the coconut and butter in the icing were quite pronounced which gave it a rich flavor in combination.  The cake was a bit denser, more like the Orange Dreamsicle cake -- very moist, but denser.  Good coconut flavor in the cake made for a nice combination of the icing and the cake.\n\nTwo left for afternoon snack . . .", "author": "Star M."}

The bakery is very small, but how much space do you really need? Grab your treat and move on. They had slices of cake the size of my face that had me drooling the moment I walked in the door. Their red velvet cupcake, which they are famous for, was amazingly good. Super flavorful and rich, topped with a sweet and creamy cream cheese frosting. Their presentation was definitely lacking - it looks like they just plopped the frosting on top with minimal effort. Not exactly something I would want to display at a nice event or catering, but for the day to day sugar fix, who really cares how they look? Apparently, they use some type of special butter in their batter that gives their cake a dense, smooth consistency. It was different, but in a good way.

There were a lot of things in there that looked good, but we hadn't eaten dinner yet, so we asked when they closed (8PM) and said we'd come back.\n\nAnd we actually almost didn't make it back.  At about 7:55PM, we were still sitting at Enoshima waiting for the waitress to have the time to bring us the check.  I finally told A to head over to SusieCakes while I took care of the bill so we wouldn't miss out.  So he went over and, would you believe it, he was back and done before I was even done with the check.\n\nHe ordered the Mocha and Chocolate Mint for himself and a Red Velvet for me.  He also got me one Susie's Nutty, which is two peanut butter cookies sandwiching peanut butter buttercream.  Super peanut butter-y.  If you don't like peanut butter, don't order this!  And, I think probably because it was closing time, they threw in another cupcake for free.  So we ended up with two Red Velvets!\n\nI thought the cake was really light and fluffy and the frosting wasn't too sweet nor too hard. They really do pile on the frosting though.

I recently grabbed some Red Velvets and a Strawberry cupcake from this shop on a weekend trip to SF.  I usually get my cupcakes from their Manhattan Beach location.\n\nDuring this day, I also grabbed some cupcakes from American Cupcake to do a comparison.\n\nThe cake in the Red Velvet is really red in color, very dense and moist. But with the frosting, you could really taste the grains of sugar on your tongue and it's consistency is really thick.  I was not happy with that.  (*If you want to know my American Cupcakes review - check out my separate review for that).  \n\nI prefer Sprinkles or Cupcakes Couture, but sometimes I don't have the time to drive so far, so I will eat these up to satisfy my love of cupcakes.  I also noticed, when I eat more than one from Susies, I get a headache.  One time a friend and I asked a worker about the cupcake's nutritional information and she wouldn't disclose the calorie or sugar content of the cupcakes.  I guess if I really knew the truth about the sugar content of cupcakes, I would think twice about my dessert obsession... but then shortly forget about it once I start craving again!\n\nI used to order cakes here for work events, but I would recommend to go the cupcake route instead.

At first we walked out of the store because although the cupcakes and freaking 6 layered cakes were amazing, we didn't see anything unique.\n\nYikes, were we wrong. Outside, we looked at the display one more time when we saw two words, Martha, and Stewart on a poster above the displays. She recommended the Strawberry cupcake, the best in the land. We best trust Martha Stewart. \n\nWe went in and tried the Strawberry cupcake like she said. !!!!!!!!!!! BEST KLSAEJRA CUPCAKE. I've never had a strawberry cupcake but this was perfect. The cupcake had a more cakey texture to it but it was still moist and chewable which melted in your mouth. The frosting was also really unique. It was a little bit more watery than usual but it was better than the more sugary and creamy texture. When it first touches your tongue it's good but as it combines with your saliva, it turns gooey which is even better! The taste was complementing. It had a slight sour taste but it was also tangy and sweet. \nI could not forget about this cupcake.

I'd gone to the Susiecakes in Brentwood a couple times in college, but for some reason, these cupcakes tasted different (better). Red velvet is a must (the cream cheese frosting isn't too heavy, and you can definitely taste the cheese, which surprisingly is hard to get right), and the vanilla is delicious too. My friend swears by the chocolate cupcake frosting, and although I'm not the hugest fan of frosting in general, I can handle Susiecakes.", "author": "Lillian K."}

They sell the cutest little baking knick knacks, candles, party goodies, etc. for all you baking lovers.  I wanted to buy everything since everything looked so good!! The family and I decided on 6 mini cupcakes (1-vanilla, 2-chocolate chocolate & 3 red velvet) & 2 regular cupcakes (strawberry & blueberry pancake).  Our most favorite was surprisingly the blueberry pancake cupcake.  It was moist, delicious and to die for.  I never knew blueberry could taste so divine in a cupcake. Just delicious and a must try!  I think it may be a seasonal flavor.  Martha Stewart's favorite cupcake from here-the strawberry cupcake was a bit too tart for my taste.  Thought it was only me, but hubby thought the same thing also.  Maybe the batch it came from was made wrong that day...who knows.  I'd be more than willing to try it agin though.  The red velvet tasted pretty yummy too.  Sprinkles still has the #1 red velvet cupcakes to me.  The chocolate chocolate and vanilla were also tasty.", "author": "Sheila M."}

There should be a balance though, if the frosting is super sweet then the cake shouldn't be and vice versa.  I didn't have that problem with their product though so I don't even know why I'm addressing it lol.\n\nSooo I walked by this brightly lit bakery and was like aw cute.  Very retro, simple and to the point.  This is a bakery, this is our display, here are some samples, have a nice day!  Fantastic.  I ordered a slice of the celebration cake and the seasonal Irish cream cupcake.  The cupcake was good but odd...?  It was chocolate-y and moist but it fell apart when you took apart the wrapper. It was almost as if somebody smashed it a little bit to put the icing inside and just smushed the cupcake back together.  The chocolate cake with the not to sweet and irish cream frosting was good enough though that I was able to look past it. \n\nNow the cake.  Think gourmet Funfetti cake.  You're probably like oooh really, I love Funfetti!  Of course you do, everybody does and they did a pretty good version.  I have one concern though.  As I had the cupcake before I dug in on the cake, I was starting to hit cake overload and I made the fatal mistake of putting my cake in the fridge.  I say \"fatal\" because I'm pretty sure that everybody that has walked out of SuzieCakes left with the warning of \"DO NOT REFRIGERATE!\" still ringing in their ears.  Brainfart on my part.  I just assumed they were so adamant about it because they were using buttercream and it would get rock hard in the fridge.  (There was a bakery in Sac that told their guests the same exact thing for that reason)  So I left it out while I went to work for it to get back to room temp.  When I got back and checked out the cake after work it was still rock hard!  The frosting and the cake!  I was like what?  What is in this cake that keeps the frosting soft at room temp until it is put in the fridge and then keeps both the cake and frosting hard even after it returns to room tempurature??  It kinda reminds me of McDonalds french fries.  You know there's something up with them because they don't start to decompose like regular natural french fries.  But even though you know they've done something seriously unnatural with them, you'll still go back because they taste good.  And chances are I will go back.  Because fresh out of the display they're pretty good!  :)", "author": "Jammir G."}

I'd like to state a couple of things: (1) It's not just about the cupcake. Presentation and icing (shout out to butter-cream) are very important. (2) A sure sign that a cake is NOT a winner is if I only take a bite out of it or worse, don't touch it because I think it is sloppy (I know, I have issues) (3) while I haven't met a cake I dislike, there are a few that rank in the bottom pile (sorry German chocolate and key lime. Anyway, on to Susie Cakes. Not sure why people think their red velvet is something to write home about. It is way too red (I consider this an imbalance of food coloring:cocoa powder), I found the cream cheese icing lacking and the cupcake simply didn't present well. My friend, bless her heart, concluded I was a loon because everyone else seems to love it. I happen to like the red velvet cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory. The color is a deep red, the cake is moist and my opinion, better than Susie cakes. I will say that I did like the 7 layer granola/chocolate/coconut bar :-)", "author": "Sierra S."}

About 3 years ago my sister got married.  I was a bridesmaid, of course, and as a bridesmaid I was to take care of certain wedding duties.  I had succeeded at each and every one of them despite my margarita infused breath that caused my slurred speech and stumble from here to there. I was so distracted that I did not even see my sister cut her wedding cake that she had slaved over ordering.  She is a cake FREAK.  She loves cake more than any other person I know.  By the end of the night she gave me my last duty.  My cake freak of a sister made sure to save her and her husband the top cake.  And guess who she put in charge? That's right, me.  I was more than capable of holding to a cake as long as I could find somewhere to sit in the middle of a picking-up tables and chairs chaos.  My baby nephew at the time decided it would be fun to jump and try to reach the cake I was told to hold with my dear life.  I made sure his little game did not cause a cake catastrophe.  Oh wait but I didn't.  It was one of those \"OHHHHH SHITTTTTTT\" moments as I saw the cake fall to the ground.  My sister hadn't tried her wedding cake that night and now I was to blame for her furious face.  Everyone of course thought I was still drunk, which I wasn't. I swear. Anyway, she made me swear to buy her a cake for her 1 year wedding anniversary.  Too bad for her I was broke a year later and too lazy the next.  It wasn't until this year that I decided to replace their cake with one that I purchased.  I looked into Susie's and they sounded delicious.  I ordered the marble cake and it was more than delicious. Shall I say scrumptious? My sister and her husband enjoyed the cake so much so that they kinda sorta forgave me for my (not my) mishap.  So thank you Susie, for erasing a guilt trip and satisfying a very happy couple :)", "author": "Brenda S."}

The peanut butter tasted very strong like you are just eating peanut butter straight from the jar. All the frostings were delicious - not too sweet and oh so creamy. My favorite would have to be the red velvet. $3 per cupcake is average but these were on the smaller side. I think they have mini ones for $1.50 but there might be a minimum order for them.

The cupcakes I have tried are the chocolate, vanilla, red velvet, and mocha. Out of these four, the red velvet is the best. Although the food dye is a little bright, the taste and texture of both the icing and cake is phenomenal. There isn't too much frosting, either.

As you can imagine, I had already had 45 or so helpings of all-things chocolate samples and is going into a sugar shock and eventually sugar coma. Yet when I walked By Susie Cakes, I just couldn't resist the temptation. The cupcakes were calling my name. Mind you, I had already had 2 mini cupcakes from Kara's Cupcakes at the fair. I walked in and saw that Susie has Sour Cream Cheesecake. Since my better half didn't go to the chocolate festival with me, I thought I reward him with a cheesecake for completing my honey to-do list at home. The individual size Sour Cream Cheesecake was just the start. I saw Lemon Square that is my all time favorite and was drooling over the display glass. One of those too please! Then moving down the line, the CUPCAKES!! OMG! Somebody stop me! 3 mini cupcakes (2 Red Velvet and 1 chocolate) and finally I am satisfied. $14 bucks later, I walked out of Susie's with a big smile on my face. \n\nThe 2 of us shared the individual Sour Cream Cheesecake with graham cracker crust and sour cream topping. It was divine. The cream cheese filling was creamy, but very light and fluffy and it wasn't overly sweet at all. The graham cracker crust gave it a crunch that matched with the cream cheese filling so perfectly. We were already full with our pork chop dinner, but we ate the whole thing. The individual size cheesecake is perfect to share for 2 people. We will go back to get the 8\" for dinner party. That will definitely be a hit. \n\nWe still have the Lemon Square and the 3 mini cupcakes in the refrigerator. Those won't last long.

That is spectacular customer service if you ask me! I would recommend this bakery to anyone.", "author": "Kim T."}

They were polite and helpful on the phone and in person when we were making up out minds about how to decorate our cake. They listened to my ideas and did a great job guiding us to a beautiful cake that fit into our budget. When I first saw our cake it felt like the best kind of scene out of Cake Boss. I was so happy. It was delicious too as evidenced by how many of our guests helped themselves to seconds. I'm looking forward to having our second helping on our anniversary this Spring. If you've never been to their bakery it's worth checking out. We sampled a few of what they had to offer and I would not hesitate to buy their cupcakes and cookies if I was going to a party and didn't have time to bake something myself. In fact after sampling we considered just doing a dessert bar instead of having a cake but in the end I decided against it just because I really wanted us to have our cutting the cake moment and cutting a cupcake or cutting the ribbon to the dessert bar just didn't feel like it would be the same.", "author": "Mary R."}

The frosting is super tasty and worth every calorie.  Plus, the frosting to cake ratio is awesome esp. when they put a dollop of that frosting right in the cake.

I loved trying all the different flavors they had!  When I got engaged and we started looking around at different bakeries for wedding cakes, I hadn't even thought about Susie Cakes because I thought they only did cupcakes.  I was thrilled to discover that they do wedding cakes too! \nI got in contact with Megan O'Leary from Susie Cakes and she scheduled us for a tasting.  The tasting consisted of three cupcakes (since it's all the same cake in a wedding cake or a cupcake anyway) with little spoons of their many different frosting choices.  That way you could mix whatever frosting you wanted with either white cake, chocolate cake, or red velvet cake.  We thoroughly enjoyed tasting all the different combinations, but in the end we ended up going for the simple yet delicious white cake with vanilla frosting!  We were so surprised because we had thought we'd go for something more exotic, but the plain one was so good we just couldn't pass it up!\nThey don't do those huge layered cakes so if that's what you're looking for, look elsewhere.  They do a great little three layer cake and then the rest they can do in giant sheet cakes to serve the rest of your guests.  We weren't looking for anything huge so it worked out perfect for us!  AND, the best part was it was our favorite tasting cake and also the least expensive among all of the bakeries I had looked into!  When does that ever happen?  We were pretty excited.\n\nMegan was great to work with.  She talked me through all of the choices we had for decoration, style, and colors. On the day of the wedding they delivered it to our venue for a small fee (which was great considering our venue was way up some windy hills).  The cake looked amazing and tasted even better!  Several guests went back for seconds.  We ended up with plenty of extra because the slices were cut pretty small, so we had plenty to take home and freeze.  That cake is almost as good frozen!

As a longtime cupcake fan (e.g., someone who has on MULTIPLE occassions driven over an hour for a Sprinkles cupcake) I can't remember a time when I haven't finished a cupcake. That is, until I tried a SusieCakes vanilla cupcake. No joke, after one excited bite, and then another to confirm my suspicions that it was not good, my cupcake went right into the trash. If you are looking for a worse version of a processed, factory made version of a Pillsbury Funfetti cake (which I actually enjoy!), then this is for you. However, if you are like me, and want a fresh, smooth, buttery cupcake...look elsewhere. Sprinkles in Palo Alto or Kara's in the Marina are both significantly better options.

You will not find light and sophisticated French baking here - no Italian meringue frosting or anything light and airy. What you will find is very old fashioned American cakes, very much alike magnolia bakery in New York. Their cakes are dense, layered in the old fashioned way. Their frostings are dense, sugary (so sugary that i can taste the grains of sugar some days), simple and unsophisticated. The thought that does go into their ingredients for each cake is commendable - pineapple with coconut, pecans/praline/raisins/carrots (just loaded with real fruit and nuts) in their carrot cake.  It does remind me of the baking of an old lady whose cakes I enjoy annually when I see her. I can tell her about the magic of meringues in cakes and frosting but there is some magic in just simple baking. It is wonderful if you set your expectations straight before going.

The service was pretty quick as we didn't have to wait long and the staff seemed super friendly.  Against the wall, opposite where the cakes and such were displayed was a small table for free samples, this day they were offering samples of their blueberry crumble (not  bad).  At first glance, I already awarded points to Kara's for having more options (cupcake wise).  Susie's just seemed so limited with their flavors offered.  However, I do like how Susie's has a variety of products overall.  In addition to cupcakes they have cookies, cakes, brownies, puddings, pies, etc.  They even have a pretty decent deal for their mini cupcakes: 3 for $5.  As far as the cupcakes we tried: mint chocolate, their seasonal orange creamsicle cupcake (*don't know if that's the actual name, but it's supposed to be like those orange cream popsicles), red velvet, and coconut.  They were all pretty good.  The cakes were moist, especially the red velvet and chocolate.  I get how some reviewers said the vanilla cupcakes are more on the dense side, but it wasn't so much that it was drier than the chocolate cakes.  The cream cheese frosting was really good, definitely had that nice cream cheese taste to it and not overwhelmingly sweet.  The mint chocolate chip was good.  It did remind me of mint chocolate chip ice cream--which happens to be my favorite ice cream flavor so I did enjoy that and the seasonal cake we tried was a vanilla cake with orange buttercream, again pretty good but the frostings on these two, were IMO, a bit too sweet.  Shocking for me since I could eat almost anything that's sweet.  You will definitely need a tall glass of milk (or water) after eating those cupcakes.  Another thing to note that their filled cupcakes are just cakes with some of the frosting piped into the cake.  They lose points for creativity in this area since Kara's offers more options for fillings for their filled cakes.  I guess Susie's is supposed to be considered a home style bakery so maybe simple is their thing.  We did also get a slice of their carrot cake, which btw is a HUGE serving! I swear that one slice could easily be 2-3 slices in one.  Go big or go home I guess!  This shop was pretty good, but since Kara's is in the same area, we'll more likely continue going there for our cupcake fix.", "author": "Tess E."}

Besides the amazing treats, they have a sparkling clean interior and friendly, warm staff. The frosting couldn't be any better, and Susiecakes NEVER bakes from a mix- unlike almost all other cupcake bakeries. \nTheir commitment to quality and customer service even as their business expands is truly inspiring to a young entrepreneur like myself. Interested to find out more about this awesomely branded company, I had the chance to talk with Susie one day. What she told me made me like the bakery (and their business) 10 times more. When Susie and her team think of new ways to serve cake and deserts, they don't really consider how much profit they will make. Their main concern is about celebration- will this desert make the customer's celebration more memorable and special?  Rough quote here sorry Susie- \"These bakeries are about connecting people through celebration. When someone buys a cake from us, I feel good. Not because of the money, but because I know that their day will be more special. I hope that our deserts can bring families and friends closer. If these cakes accomplish that, even for a few minutes, I feel my bakeries are a success.\"\nSusie is awesome. So are her cakes. Check it out!", "author": "Katherine A."}

When I walked in, there were a bunch of ladies behind the counter chatting away.  I stood there for a few seconds.  They kept chatting.  I almost walked out because I was getting impatient, but then some other dude in front of me walked out, which got one lady's attention and I decided to stay.  I ordered a red velvet and a lemon cupcake.  Most of the time I order a seasonal as well, but the seasonal right now is pineapple upside down, and when I had that one last year, I wasn't really a fan.  Usually when I order two cupcakes, I give the red velvet to my mother and keep the other.  However, I walked around the Cherry Blossom Festival and deserved to eat both (sorry, mom).  The lemon one did not hit the spot at all and I don't know why because it's usually my go-to cupcake.  I'm glad I ate the red velvet one though because it was amazing.  I usually don't eat all the frosting because bakeries tend to overfrost cupcakes, but I couldn't stop eating it.  Five stars for the amazing red velvet, which turned me into a fan.  Minus one star for mysteriously bad service and the weird lemon one, which I will pretend doesn't exist from now on.  Hopefully the service was some fluke because I plan on going back.", "author": "k h."}

I had a huge slice of their Classic Marble cake and it was so yummy! A fluffy mix of chocolate and vanilla cake (with some chocolate chips thrown in), topped with creamy chocolate and vanilla buttercream frosting. I love that the frosting wasn't overly sweet and that it was just the right amount. I would definitely go back to try the other cake flavors; Red Velvet, Carrot, Coconut, German chocolate, pretty much all of the 7 types they make! I also bought a 7-layer bar, which I didn't really like because I thought there was too many butterscotch chips, but I gave the bar to someone else and they loved the taste. This location is pretty small and there's no place to sit inside but they had 2 small tables outside. I guess you don't really need to sit down to eat a cupcake/cookie/bar, but if you're getting the cake you'd probably want a place to sit.", "author": "Zehra S."}

We tried the lemon, chocolate w/ vanilla frosting, chocolate w/ peanut butter frosting, and the red velvet.  I was worried that the red velvet was not going to be as heavenly as I had remembered since I had put it \"on the pedestal\" (40 Year Old Virgin anyone?), but my cravings were vindicated upon my second encounter with the velvety, almost creamy, richly flavored cake in symphony with the fantastic cheesecake frosting.  Different red velvet cakes from different places speak to different people--this one speaks to me and is probably the best red velvet I have tried, not something I would say lightly, btw.  The lemon was my second fav.  I would have liked to have had a bit more potent peanut butter flavor in the PB frosting, but that's typical for me.  Will be back for more red velvet....I have quite a few more flavors to try as well, life's hard sometimes.", "author": "Ana B."}

We were on Chestnut grabbing a coffee before heading out of town and gave in at the last minute.  My daughter and I bought two cupcakes....coconut and vanilla. There were a lot of very tempting flavors but we decided on vanilla because is was decorated so cutely in a SF Giants theme.  SO DELICIOUS.  The frosting was just the right consistency and sweetness and the cupcake itself was very moist.  We shared 2 cupcakes between the 4 of us and we were ready to run back in and buy about a dozen more but we had already given up our parking spot.  Lots of tempting cupcake flavors but next time I think I might buy a whole cake.  The cakes were just beautiful and looked nice and moist as well.  The cupcakes were pricey but wonderful and we will definitely hit Susie Cakes the next time we're in the area.", "author": "Colleen W."}
