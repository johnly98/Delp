R\u00e9veille is the perfect mix of hipster, modern and chic and located in the heart of the Castro. They offer full breakfast and a wide variety of sweet and savory items, ranging from avocado toast (because duh!) to scones and almond croissants. Their coffee is top-notch and the baristas know damn well how to make a latte look like a piece of art.\n\nDid someone say, \"On Wednesday's we wear pink?\" because at R\u00e9veille, two charming baristas - Oscar and Dan - coordinate their outfits (which are always on fleek) and fill the space with energy and create a sense of community I'm happy to be a part of. If you have the time, be sure to give them a visit and leave a tip for their excellent customer service.", "author": "Bryan D."}

Literally every table inside was occupied by one person on a computer or a phone, all in a line facing the counter. It felt like a satire.\n\nThat being said, the area in the front seems better for gathering with a friend and feels a bit organic. \n\nMy latte was solid, though there seemed to be something missing from my friend's dirty chai, maybe a little less chai than expected, as it was missing some of the earthy and spiciness we usually associate with dirty chais.

I came here for breakfast one weekend morning and had the \"Shakshuka,\" a bold breakfast item that consisted of a poached egg that was swimming in chickpeas, some spicy tomato sauce, which I think had some jalapenos even, although my memory is a bit fuzzy. I also had one of their very smooth and strong cups of coffee.\n\nLet me just say that the Shakshuka and coffee did not go together like two peas in a pod. Next time, I'd probably opt for the more traditional breakfast sandwich (which looks delicious from the pictures), but I did enjoy all the flavors of the Shakshuka; it was great to try it once, but it just felt weird eating something like that for breakfast with a hot cup of coffee. Guess I'm just not used to it.\n\nA+ gold star for myself for a healthy choice though!

Not sure if it's the machine behind the orders or what but that part has happened so so many times while rushing to work that it's not even funny anymore!

There's a gorgeous outdoor seating area that's literally covered in leaves and whatnot from trees (it's even prettier when the flowers are blooming!). Great spot for people watching or doing some work. There's ample seating indoors too. It's a hip establishment serving up delicious coffee, and the staff are super friendly as well! \n\nI've tried a few items from Reveille. The coffee is pretty great! Not the best I've ever had, but it's a solid cup of joe. I've also had soy cappuccinos from here and they're delicious as well -- strong but not overwhelming. I had the avocado toast here the other day with a fried egg. It was lackluster PRIMARILY because of the toast. It was far too stiff and crunchy, which, with how it was served, made it very difficult to eat (had to cut it with fork and nice because of the fried egg). Mind you, the presentation was beautiful. It came out on a black chunk of wood. So hip. Ya know how we do in SF. If the toast was served on a different type of bread or better bread ya know, it would be perfect. Good amount of avocado and the fried egg was perfectly cooked. That's my only qualm. Wouldn't order the avocado toast here again but DEFINITELY would come here for coffee.

Every month, or so, I try again. I'm either an optimist or a dope. Probably the latter. \n\nOther than inconsistent espresso drinks, this cafe is fine, but the outside seating is what does it for me. Without that bit of light and air, one would be relegated to a boxy, dark space (that I think actually is a garage-conversion) that would make a claustrophobic feel anxious. The often groovy, but just a tad too loud music doesn't help. It's a small space where patrons often come to chat while they eat/drink & one should set the music level accordingly.

There is the usual and semi mythical street parking, but like lot a lot of other things in the city you are best served by getting here some other way that does not involve driving. \n\nThere are a lot of two spot type table chair combos along with a long center counter/bar and a limited amount of super awesome outside patio style seating. Unusually for the area the outside seating is wooden counter and bar stools or ledges. That along with some excellent landscaping make the patio seating a very nice option. The inside non counter spots tend to fill up with laptop campers, but even so there is generally room for one or two more.\n\nThe decor is brand new and very welcoming. Lots of earth tones, warm colors and low lights, not to mention the rotating local art adorning the walls. The overall effect is very welcoming. While the coffee trends towards slightly better then starbucks quality that's not all that big a deal in a city with some truly epic coffee places especially given the starbucks level pricing. The menu items tend to be better then you might expect. The avocado toast is pretty much always a win, and is highly recommended as a noshable  selection. Service is the by now standard of order at counter and wait for order to be called out model. There may be a line but it moves quick and if it's busy they'll just bring the food out to you.\n\nSo with wonderful ambiance, a great menu and good verging on great coffee this is overall a great coffee hangout.", "author": "Steven W."}

Friendly staff, cozy seating, and a small patio ideal for people-watching.  Even on a busy weekend morning, I managed to snag a place to sit without much difficulty.\n\nUnfortunately, the enjoyment ended once my coffee arrived.  I ordered a mocha, which was was bland and gritty.  This surprised me, since mochas are awfully hard to mess up.  (Coffee and chocolate?  How could that go wrong?)\n\nI also had a bowl of yogurt and granola, which was fine but unremarkable.  The portion size was shockingly small for $7.  It was gone in just a few bites.  That was stingy even by San Francisco standards.\n\nAll in all, I'd say that San Francisco has better coffee shop options than Reveille.  I guess my standards are higher in a city with one of the most competitive coffee shop scenes around.", "author": "David G."}

I first stopped at Philz but the line was too long and there was no seating. The typical Tesora would have been nice but I left exploring for somewhere else. \n\nI decided to stray from Castro St, and walk down 18th. That's when I encountered this gem. I noticed people chillin' in the vine draped patio area, drinking cappuccinos or having a late afternoon hot meal. Although this place appears to be primarily a coffee shop, it has a few hot dining options as well. Which is a bit hit or miss because when I'm having coffee, I don't really want the whiff of mustard. \n\nCool vibe inside--mellow acoustic guitar in the background, the patio greenery flowing inside, industrial looking grey concrete flooring, a long white bench with soft cushions, and most curiously wall-to-wall light brown wooden tiling which extended across the ceiling. In a way, it felt as though the ceiling and floor should be reversed. The trippy black and white tiling all across the counter added a nice contrast to the overwhelming wood theme. A bit on the loud side (with the typical inane chatter in the background), and the lighting is dim, so I'd say it's a place that's better for catching up with friends than working on anything requiring your focus. \n\nI ordered the latte and chocolate chip cookie. The latte was satisfying, smooth medium blend. The chocolate chip cookie was thick, with salt pieces on top; also satisfying. \n\nOverall, not a bad choice if you're looking to find a unique spot to meet up with a friend on a Saturday afternoon.", "author": "Behnam S."}

To me at least, the espresso is overpriced, lacking in flavor, and weak.\n\nThey've also branched into juices and juice shots. This means you can now pay $4 for a couple ounces of water mixed with turmeric.\n\nAnd the food is even worse (to me, at least). I've tried one of their breakfast sandwiches (the one with merguez), and on another occasion, my friend tried a different breakfast sandwich. Both were doused in an overpowering sauce and were just not tasty.\n\nAlso, some the staff can be pretentious. Asking for any modification to anything can get you a sneer. I once asked if they do iced cappuccinos, and was given a lecture on how they don't do that because it requires throwing away steamed milk. Couldn't they just not throw it away, or increase the ratio of foam to steam? Another time, I asked if it's possible to reduce the sugar on my matcha latte order, and was just told \"no, sorry\" (no explanation, though I'm assuming they pre-mix their matcha with sugar, which is fine).\n\nThat all said, the one thing that is worth trying, if you're already here, is their matcha latte.

The inside was very modern and organized as well.

Looks can be decieving from the photos online... they don't give any justice to how big the space is inside. We opted to sit at the hightop counters that divide the counter from wall/booth seating... if you don't mind being close to others, this is a perfect spot.\n\nTheir cappuccinos & pour over coffee were divine, but I just couldn't get over the pastries. We ordered a Kouign Amann, which is essentially a cronut on crack and a biscuit with jam (homemade deliciousness).

For example, they aren't afraid to bring your coffee to you, if you are in a wheelchair...believe me when I say that's a rarity in this city!!\n\nSpeaking of which, Reveille is fully WHEELCHAIR-ACCESSIBLE...by which I mean that not only is this cafe set up to be wheelchair accessible, but it actually is in practice, too, because there aren't tables and chairs always blocking access.  And there's a good bathroom.  That's right, y'all.\n\nUnlike many of the other more hipster coffee joints in the city these days, Reveille has FREE WI-FI and no maximum-sitting-time.  They serve food, too, in case you're hungry.  I've only tried the plain cheese flatbread, and while it was tasty, I was surprised to find that it was spicy, as though there might be an ample amount of something like white pepper or possibly chili oil on it...This was not mentioned on the menu, and I wouldn't have ordered it if it had been, since I'm a wimp when it comes to spice!\n\nThe outdoor patio area is quite possibly my favorite people-watching place in the city, as it is slightly set back from the sidewalk, and therefore protected from the various degrees of cray-cray that one can encounter walking by!  \n\nDrink a lot of coffee?

The couple times I've been to its \"O.G.\" store on Columbus, I've walked away with a humdrum reaction. Even before you walk in, the Castro shop exudes warmth and welcome. I recently dropped in and saw all these \"happy, peppy people\" (I sound like Lucille Ball) sitting outside sipping coffee and nibbling on toast. I figured, \"This has gotta be a good sign.\"\n\nI entered Reveille and immediately noticed the charming interior. Funky patterns, interesting prints (very West Elm-ish), light furnishings, and an open layout (albeit a somewhat low ceiling) make for a pleasant cafe experience. Not to keep bringing it back to their North Beach location, but... there, though they are surrounded by windows on a corner and the ceilings are high, the Columbus store is incredibly hot because of poor ventilation... not to mention the awkward shape to that store. The Castro location has a better and clearer set-up and plenty of fresh air shooting into the store thanks to a big open entrance. \n\nI recently had their chai latte ($4). It was tasty, spicy, and not too sweet. The baristas are friendly and maintain the cafe well. There is a small selection of newspapers for reading (I love that! I personally will always be loyal to print.). I will note that the place gets quite busy during lunch hour. I recently stopped by on a weekday around 11, and by Noon, it was crowded. I would also advise lunch-goers that this isn't the place for a quick bite. It appeared most folks' food took some time to come out, but they did look very appetizing. I'll have to come back to try some of their dishes some time. \n\nOverall, I'm impressed and pleased by this Reveille location.

I had no intentions of going inside since I always seemed to not notice it while walking in Castro.  It was pretty much chance that I saw this little shop wedged in the gayborhood.\n\nAll the seats were taken outside and when I got inside there was a lot of hustle and bustle.  Definitely a busy coffee shop.  Lots of gossip and \"what happened last night?\"-'s.  Anyhow, they have a very kempt and fresh staff.  Handsome, cute, etc.  I'm here for coffee though.\n\nInside, it was pretty compact.  Every chair and table was taken but there was an empty seat on the community table.  It had a pretty modern, sophisticated feel.  The black and white patterns were complimented with light stained hardwood.  I felt like I was in an open house for a fancy but affordable apartment that all of San Francisco had to go to.  Loved the overall design of the establishment.\n\nThey struck conversation with every customer; usually short and sweet but the customer in front of me had a pretty involved one.  I was mildly jealous that I wasn't part of it.  Though when I did end up ordering my coffee, we had at least a brief, warm, and welcoming exchange.  Hi-5 on the customer service.  I did not order any food and I felt a little too self conscious to order the chocolate chip cookie.  Kept thinking that everyone was saying, \"he's going to order coffee AND a chocolate chip cookie?\"  Eye roll.  I decided to only order the coffee.\n\nCoffee was a delicious brew from Heaven.  I just about set myself up in the perfect position to enjoy my book.  However, it was impossible to read in that cafe.  It was loud.  Very loud.  I constantly had FOMO feelings that I missed something important from all discussions around me.  I left after reading 2 pages.  Maybe I came at an impossibly busy time?  The pictures uploaded here seem to show a less crowded space.\n\nOverall, yes, I will come here again; but with +1 or +2 to save face.

Unfortunately, we had decided to be spontaneous around 7:00 pm.. so most of the coffee shops were already closed by then. HOWEVER! This lovely little place was open for a little less than one more hour! The kitchen was already closed up so we were unable to try their delectable looking avocado toast with Mr. Poached Eggu on top, but we were already thankful enough that they let us sit and drink coffee in their while they cleaned up. \n\nI got a pour over, and it definitely hit the spot. Made me feel prepped to conquer the world. My friend got the Dirty Chai which is basically a Chai Latte with a shot of espresso! The Dirty Chai had that unique spice to it! Tasted like a hint of cayenne pepper? I'm not too sure! But it definitely added a kick to the drink. I wouldn't be able to finish it all on my own though. \n\nBut forreal, this place is super nicely decorated inside. There is an obvious love for wood, and it made me feel very cozy and warm with my coffee. I thought the wall of timber was super appealing to the aesthetic eye! I would want a wall like that somewhere in my future home.", "author": "Kim N."}

I am very grateful to have a place with fresh greens and interesting sandwiches in the neighborhood. The orders take some time to prepare, which can be slightly anxiety inducing when on a short lunch break, but it's always worth it.\n\nThe weekday clientele knocks my rating down one star though. Maybe one of the self-absorbed  jerks manspreading at a four person table could create an app that would calculate how much food and drink he needs to purchase per hour of sitting there to make the business sustainable. How do they not understand that a cafe makes money by turning tables? Stop treating it like your live/work loft unless you are going to pay the rent. The next time i have to take my lunch to go because the place is an ibook parking lot, I might accidentally-on-purpose spill my coffee on a laptop so that at least there is one beverage on the table.\n\nThe new policy of no electrical outlets while still maintaining free wifi will surely strike the right balance.", "author": "Jenn H."}

It's always impossible to get a seat as the crowd settles in with their laptops and STAYS. Hey good for them. Not so good for me.\n\nSo yes- fine coffee and all that, but I'd rather head to Thoroughbread on Church for their amazing scones, or up to Peet's on Market for just coffee.

Breakfast until 11:30 but you can get takeaway and essentially make the breakfast sandwich your lunch, as I did because I can't ever get up early enough to have that big of a breakfast followed by a lunch.\n\nThe sandwich is the first one on the menu - Egg Sandwich w/ Bacon (fried egg, braised kale + leek, and gruyere on Della Fattoria levain). There are two prices $7.50 (egg sandwich) and $9 (w/ bacon). Not as apparent as they might have thought because I had to ask. \n\nI have to admit, when I opened the takeaway box and saw a plain looking sandwich I was a little disappointed. It just looked so plain. It looks exactly like the photos so I didn't feel tricked, I think I just wasn't paying attention. However one bite and my mind was blown. Such attention to detail really made an amazing sandwich. #1 - the slices of bread were toasted/grilled with butter/olive oil on both sides before being assembled into a sandwich. #2 - the bacon was perfectly cooked to crispy without being burnt. #3 - they use some quality gruyere because it had a whiff of that stinky funky cheese smell. I kept sniffing like what's that smell then realized it was the cheese. #4 - the cheese was melted into the kale and leeks while the bacon was kept crispy. And of course #5 - a soft cooked egg in a hole on top.\n\nSeriously good breakfast sandwich and it's so close to me! I'd put it up right up there with my other favorite breakfast sandwich at Devil's Teeth Baking.\n\nPS This is a small place and by the time i showed up at 11:15 all the tables were taken with (surprise surprise) people on laptops leaving just the outside tables and inside bar free. Though that's fine with me it felt a little weird to be the only person eating there so I got mine to go.", "author": "Jean K."}

Kale, eggs, and avo are pretty much my favorite foods, so this place is heaven sent :)) Not to mention the super friendly, non-pretentious staff and great chill music selection.\n\n I've spent about three hours here now, and moving to the Castro has crossed my head multiple times :P", "author": "K C."}

This place gets all five stars.\n\nThe pros:\n\n+ The ambience is fantastic. The lighting is bright and the interior design is sleek. It feels both modern and safe\n+ The wifi is free. Unlike cafes like Sophie's which charge you per hour, Reveille offers you an unlimited stream of wifi. For the most part, it's fast, too\n+ The wide selection of food and drinks. To be fair, I haven't had any food besides the Chinese Chicken Salad, which is 3/5, but the number of options seems favorable\n\nThe cons:\n\n- Always busy. I've come at all times of the day and have rarely found the cafe not totally packed. If you're looking for a lot of space to call your own, this may not be it\n\n- No outlets. If you're a student or someone who needs a fully powered laptops for hours to complete his work, beware. There is one outlet in the entire cafe, and as you can imagine, it's usually taken. Consider yourself time-limited\n\nI can tell you this place is the best in the neighborhood. Illy Cafe is behind it. Sweet Inspiration behind that. Sophie's has a ridiculous wifi policy (1 hour per purchase), so i wouldn't recommend it if you value wifi", "author": "Aj P."}

No offence to any US citizens but ordinarily, coffee is no more than a brown novelty drink.  Reveille however, knows and understands how to serve coffee. We ordered two espresso which were served with a courteous smile, and followed by a very knowledgeable conversation about the origin and mix of the beans that went into our drinks. After chatting with us our server offered us a free espresso and joined us to hear our comments and offer her opinions on it depth of flavours. If you know anything about coffee you will know that this is a place to go and that the neighbour two doors away, is to be avoided at all cost.

However, the oddest thing they do is, after they enter your order into their computer screen, they turn the screen towards you and have you then choose a tip amount from three choices on screen. It looked as if it was -$1-$2 -or $3 if you got just a drink, and 15%- 20% -or 25% if you got more than just a drink.  I can't say this for sure, but it's my best guess.
