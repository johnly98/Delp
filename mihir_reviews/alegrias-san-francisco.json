The mussels were probably the largest and juicer I've ever had. All of the sauces for these dishes went well with their complimentary bread.

We had one of the specials which was clams and snails in a tomato based sauce, it was excellent...the snails were so delicious! The anchovies were good, not sure we would order again but it was nice to have something that wasn't overly dressed.   The mushrooms were a variety of types and had great flavor.  Paired with the flaming manchego cheese, they were great.  We finished with a Graham's 20 year tawny port and the creme catalana (basically an orange creme brulee), which was perfect.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-05-20", "description": "TLDR - Solid Spanish tapas but the dishes lacked a wow factor in comparison to other tapas restaurants in SF\n\nI've basically been slowly going around SF looking for the best Spanish tapas restaurant. Alegrias is a pretty small one sort of hidden away in the Marina. Compared to the other places I've been to, it's definitely on the homier side and it feels very family run. The restaurant is rather cramped inside and has more of a casual, intimate feel. It seems to get busy on the weekend, so make a reservation in advance if you can. \n\nThe menu has a variety of hot tapas, a few cold ones and paella, and there's a solid wine menu as well. The paellas take about 30 minutes, but they time everything pretty well so that there isn't a long wait in between dishes. For 4 people, we ordered 5 tapas, 1 paella and 1 pitcher of sangria for about $130 after tax/tip.\n\nThe dishes and menu offering felt more traditional with none of that flair you sometimes get at more trendy restaurants. The food was pretty good but as a whole, I wasn't wowed. Definitely recommend the Croquetas and Empanadillas though.\n\n* SANGRIA ($26 for pitcher)\nOne pitcher's maybe good for 6 of their glasses (which were on the smaller side for wine glasses). \n\n* EMPANADILLAS DE CARNE ($8.50) - 4.5/5\n[beef, green onions, olives, raisins, herbs]\nComes with only 2 empanadillas, each of which are maybe 2 bites. They're really good though so I'd recommend ordering enough to have your own. The beef filling was sweet and delicious and the outside was crisp without being greasy.\n\n* CROQUETAS DE JAMON IBERICO Y GAMBA ($9.50) - 5/5\n[croquettes filled w/ minced jamon iberico & prawn]\nProbably the best thing we ordered! This one comes with 4 croquetas, each of which was delicately fried on the outside and filled with creamy goodness on the inside.\n\n* ESPINACAS A LA CATALANA ($8.50) - 4/5\n[saut\u00e9ed spinach, garlic, raisins, apple, pine nuts]\nI'm convinced I should be sauteeing my spinach with raisins and apples now to add some sweetness. I was disappointed at how small the portion size was though.. Not really worth ordering in comparison to other dishes.\n\n* PATATAS AIOLI ($8) - 3.5/5\n[crisp fried potatoes, traditional aioli sauce]\nIf you love potatoes, you'll probably like these more than I did. They had a decent crisp to them, but otherwise I found them pretty average. I've had Spanish patatas at other places paired with a tastier sauce. The portion size was big and filling though.\n\n* CONEJO A LA CAZUELA ($13) - 4/5\n[stewed rabbit w/ vegetables & wine]\nThere were only 3 pieces of meat so the dish was disappointing for the price. The tomato broth was tasty but also simple, nothing super special in flavor.\n\n* PAELLA A LA VALENCIANA CON CHORIZO ESPANOL ($29) - 3/5\n[saffron flavored spanish rice, chicken, seafood, chorizo]\nOne of the more disappointing paellas I've had. The chicken was well cooked and the chorizo was tasty, but the seafood was a little overcooked and the rice lacked flavor and fragrance. I always look forward to the crispy rice at the bottom of the pan, but theirs failed to really produce any of that crunch.", "author": "Jessie L."}

The 3 of us ordered tapas style which is the way to go, and every single dish was outstanding and authentic. Everything in Alegrias is well balanced. There is no Modern Spanish with a twist; this is Spanish food: original and authentic, and excellent as ever! Their Sangria is a must. Don't miss the empanadillas and tortilla espa\u00f1ola. I loved Callos a la Madrile\u00f1a!... last time I had them that good was in Madrid, 5 years ago. Croquetas and gambas al ajillo we're excellent, and their calamari was just right. For octopus lovers, their octopus was cooked to perfection, not chewy. I'm visiting SF for 9 days, and I have already come back. I'm planning to go back before I leave.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-07-01", "description": "It was my first time there and it was wonderful. It hit all the notes a great dining experience should. The interior was a comfortable setting. The staff was professional and kind. The food was terrific. We started with a pitcher of Sangria that was generous and very tasty.\u00a0\n\nWe started with a bowl of assorted olives that I must admit struck me as the best I've ever enjoyed. Then we shared three tapas dishes. Grilled asparagus with manchego cheese, croquettes of jamon and shrimp, and beef empanadas. Each dish was presented in a pleasing fashion with portions that were just right. It was obvious that the preparation for each dish was perfected by someone who over time had learned to get everything right. There was also a simplicity about the food that added to its elegance. Like the great blues man B.B. King who could play with a very slow hand but each note was perfection, Alegrias gustatory notes were perfection, too.\u00a0\n\nWe followed the tapas with a shared Spanish sausage and chicken paella. I appreciated that the waiter suggested that one was plenty to share for two rather trying for an upsell. The richness of mingled flavors in the paella really delighted us. It was generous with the seafoods, the chicken was moist and the Spanish sausage was a great accent added. It was cooked with just the right amount of caramelization at the edges of the pan. You know the stuff, the crusty really intensified flavors of the dish that you scrape every last bit off the pan. We ate every bite of everything. It took us to a very happy state of satiety but still wouldn't say no to dessert.\u00a0\n\nOur dulce de leche crepes were oh so caramelly, both of the flavor of the DL and the crusty caramelization on the crepe from its time in the pan. We had a Spanish version of creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e that had an orange accent to it. Loved it. A small glass of port went well with our desserts.\u00a0\n\nTowards the end of the evening the owner/chef came to our table (and others) to inquire if we were pleased with our dinners. Very old school and refreshing! I was embarrassing myself by going on and on about how much I enjoyed dining in his restaurant. He leaned over close and asked me if I knew his secret. I said no. He said that he tries to make every dish in the most traditional Spanish fashion. He felt that too often chefs want to add their own twist to classic dishes. He wanted to present the most traditional version done with the perfection of that perfect B.B. King guitar note. Done that way maybe the only \"twist\" a dish needs. It certainly worked for every bite of every dish we had.\n\nWhen the check arrived I was pleasantly surprised how reasonable it was for all we had enjoyed. By San Francisco standards it was a down right bargain.\n\nSo why am I, who has no relationship to this restaurant other than being a first time customer, writing this long review? Because family run restaurants like this are becoming harder to find all the time. They have a charm that goes beyond being just a tasty place to get some eats. It's like being invited into someone's home. Someone with traditions, pride and individuality that are unique to them. It's dining in a personal fashion. No matter how good a dining chain restaurant \u00a0is, it's still a chain. This is from the earliest traditions of restaurants and money alone can't buy it.\n\nAlegrias has been there for 20 years; it's a treasure and deserves its community's support. Sadly, I'm just visiting from L.A. so I'm depending on locals who read this to keep Alegrias well supported. I'll do my part when I come to town.", "author": "Bruce S."}

I called them to inquire, and the lady who picked up my call was so nice as to prepare our table as we were walking there (it took about 10 minutes for our large group to leisurely saunter over).\n\nMy first impression of the restaurant when I first walked in was that it was very intimate and romantic. The inside is dimly lit and has a cozy feel to it. Most of the tables were occupied by couples young and old going for a Saturday night dinner date. We were seated in the back area where they had prepared our table, and it felt even more romantic in there because they had these strings of yellow lights strung up along the walls.\n\nFor 9 people, we ordered 3 paellas (each paella serves around 2) and 14 tapas dishes and that was a good amount of food.\n\nFor me the highlights of the meal were:\n\nArroz negro (paella): liked the squid ink paella a lot more than the other two paellas we got. The flavor was more subtle than the seafood paella but it still had really good flavor.\n\nEmpanadillas de carne: these small empanadas were served piping hot.

This is a perfect spot for authentic Spanish tapas. Alegrias has continually impressed me and my entire family. Here are my highlights: \n1. The ambiance is very cozy and intimate. I love the personal touch with the unique decor on the walls, as well as the low lighting. \n2. The food is divine! My family is a big fan of the family style menu. My food highlights include the crispy fried potatoes, the Spanish style potato and onion omelette, and of course their famous Paella. The flambeed apple crepe has never disappointed and always raises an \"wow!\" from everyone at the table.  \n3.

Good was mediocre at best. We started with a plate each of jamon and cheese. Although good, it was not the Iberico de Bellota advertised. The cheese was good as well, the same cheese found at Costco, Trader Joe's and other places. We ordered chorizo, and were presented with a casuals of thinly sliced sausage with apples and onions that did not taste Spanish at all. The croquetas de jamon were a huge disappointment. Pasty thick with no jamon flavor. The gambas were drowning in a sauce that was superfluous with pimenton that completely masked any seafood flavor. For desert my companion ordered churros von chocolate, e pecking the light crunchy churros and thick pudding-like chocolate she had all over Spain. Instead she got a plate of leaden fried dough with cinnamon and runny cold chocolate. She made her displeasure known to the waiter, and shortly later the Argentinian cook came by with a bar of Valor chocolate to show that was what he used. He made excuses for every comment stating that if she didn't like the churros he would eat them himself.", "author": "ALICE l."}

It's dimly lit, romantic, and intimate, so love was definitely in the air that night. There was a prix fixe menu, so we got the lobster croquettes, gambas al ajillo (garlic/white wine prawns), lamb stuffed piquillo peppers, jamon serrano, escalivada, and the CALLOS A LA MADRILENA (Note: I thought I'd be adventurous and order the rabbit stew, but they were sold out that night so I'm assuming it's good. Still on my list!). I love me some Spanish food, but I particularly love this place because they offer a lot of dishes that they don't serve at other Spanish restaurants. Everything we ordered was delicious, but it's the callos a la madrilena (Madrid style tripe) that has me coming back to this place. That, and to my pleasant surprise, a waitress that I met at El Torito was serving us that night and it was great to see her again. I stop by this restaurant to say Hi because she's a sweetheart.\n\nNot a lot of restaurants serve this kind of Madrid style tripe in all its yummy tomato sauce glory, so when the craving strikes I go straight here. The last time we ate here, we also tried the garlic mushrooms and the jamon iberico & prawn croquettes, and both are yummy in my tummy. I'd definitely order those again. As an Asian, people find it appalling that I dislike rice, but I like some kinds of rice as long as its different. So we ordered the arroz negro, which is paella cooked in squid ink. It's very flavorful but also very filling so I was stuffed. I've also ordered the manchego flambeado as recommended by other Yelpers, which was cool to watch and to try, but it's not a must have.\n\nTo summarize, Alegrias is a wonderful Spanish restaurant, especially if you want to explore more authentic Spanish dishes (I.E. more than just jamon serrano, manchego cheese, patatas bravas, etc. *yawn*). Don't forget to order a pitcher of sangria or some Spanish red wine to get the full experience :)", "author": "Stephanie Joyce D."}

These were the star of the dinner--very flavorful and tender, with a nice crisp in the outside.\n\nDecent, but probably would not order again:\n--Gambas al Ajillo (shrimp in tomato-based sauce). Flavorful sauce, however you need to drink with a spoon along with the shrimp in order to get the flavor.\n\nPASS on:\n--Arroz Negra (squid ink paella) (entree). I normally love anything squid ink. This, however, was way overdone and incredibly dry--so much so, that I couldn't even stick a fork into parts of the paella. Poor execution aside, the flavor was also lacking--as it was with the majority of the other dishes...\n--Croquettes filled with Spanish ham and shrimp. 4 pieces, about twice as big as a jalape\u00f1o popper. Filling was very mushy. Came with a sauce that did not pair well--sauce was like a non-spicy spicy mayo. Considering the lack of flavor and unappealing consistency (and color--brownish inside), I would have preferred pre-frozen jalape\u00f1o poppers.\n--Bocadillos (crab cakes) with mild jalape\u00f1o cream sauce. Very mild--can't taste any jalape\u00f1o in the sauce, and it was in desperate need of seasoning. Crab cakes were also mushy inside, though the outside had a nice crisp, similar to the croquettes.\n\nOverall a very homey authentic-feeling Spanish restaurant, but food was disappointing. Chef walks around and chats with patrons, which is nice. His recommendations were the frog legs and shrimp.\n\nWithout the frog legs, Alegrias would have been 2 stars for me. The Valencia paella was not good, however another party (who pronounced it \"pa-ella\", rhyming with umbrella...), said it was good.  Could be that I chose the dishes very poorly, however with the majority of the dishes being severely lacking (and at the pricy range of $8-12 per tapas-sized dish), I find it hard to believe that our meal was not representative of the menu as a whole.

It's cozy and very family style that somehow made you feel comfortable and relax. It's not some fancy high-end restaurant for you elite yelper. Know what it is before you go. \n\nThe food is good.

The tapas potion is not big. If you've more than 3 person, expect to order at least 4-5 depends on how hungry you're. The paella is enough for 2 person maybe 3 so you figure.

It's $33 per head and it's considerable on the high side. \n\nOverall, this is a good place to hangout once in a while. Will this be my usual joint, maybe not.", "author": "Jason L."}

And must confess: the best meal I had in 2016 was eaten here last April at Alegrias. And when my best friend was visiting the Bay Area the past month, for his last night in SF I thought to take him here. This might also allow me the opportunity to pick up the canvass wine bag I'd left at Alegrias the last time I was here. Though, then again, what were the odds that the management would still continue to hold it for me, nearly ten months later? \n\nWe came in the door, me somewhat tweaked from a 13 hour work day, and the yucky rush hour trek from the East Bay. But the ambience, along with the wait staff seemed as welcoming as I'd remembered it. \n\nI mentioned the green wine bag I'd left here. And then we ordered several of my favorites: the AMAZING roasted potatoes --who knew potatoes could be the star of their own show?; the garlic prawns; the frogs' legs--which may be the most deliciously seasoned fried morsels in existence; the calamari w/ the magic pink sauce so delicious that when the calamari had disappeared, you looked for something--anything-- through which more of it could be delivered to your lips; the slightly smoky roasted asparagus covered w /melted Manchego; a special: the fish and clam dish, whose sauce was so good the serving dish got wiped clean with bread. \n\nBut just before the procession of glorious dishes appeared, our friendly waiter Juan came by and said he had a surprise. He was holding my wine bag.  And then he said he had a very special wine available tonight. (Which didn't make sense, since we had hardly made a dent yet in the gorgeous, and reasonably priced Spanish red already on the table).  He brought the \"special\" wine to our table. And I noticed this bottle had notes written on it that included such things as the wines' Parker score (94) and it's drinking window. I hear myself saying: \"Gee, this is the kind of thing I write on my own bottles.\"  And then Juan said, \"This IS your own bottle--you left it in your wine bag!\" (This IS a family business, so don't be surprised if they treat you like family).\n\nAnd in terms of the food, it was one hit after another; perfectly realized dishes. You sensed the chef had inherited recipes from a many centuries old culinary tradition. This was real deal Spanish cooking of the highest order. And my best meal of 2017 so far!", "author": "Gary R."}

It was not horrible, but it wasn't very good or what I felt to be authentic. I found the chorizo to be so-so, and that is really the main ingredient I crave in Spanish dishes. The portion sizes are also tiny for the prices. For two people, we spent over $100 on one paella, two drinks, one dessert and two tapas. Kind of nuts, if you know what this stuff goes for in Spain.

The rest of the fare is just as tasty though more common. Atmosphere and service is lively when they have a full house but can also be quiet on other days.

We called them up earlier to make reservation. On reaching, we were happily greeted and directed to the back room with large table. \n\nAmbiance - This place is romantic inside - clean white washed walls, dim lighting, crisp white tablecloth on tables, walls adorned neatly with Spanish assorted pictures and decorations.\n \nFor larger groups they have Pre-fixe menu with 2 options -\nOption 1: Salad and tapas,  includes most options from menu but excludes paella,  for $28 per person.  \nOption 2: Salad and tapas, WITH paella, for $36 per person. We went with option 2 with paella.\n\nThe most outstanding dishes are -\n\n1. Marinated olives - These olives definitely deserve a special mention. So delish and addictive that i couldn't stop popping into my mouth! Believe me, A MUST TRY!\n2. Spanish potato and caramelized onion omelette - These omelettes are a thing! Why not come here for brunch, i ask?\n3. Gambas al Ajillo, prawns sauteed with garlic, parsley, and wine. Delicious.\n4. Patatas Aioli - Crisp fried potatoes tossed in garlic aioli. Another favorite of the night, MUST TRY!\n5. Mushrooms sauteed in garlic and wine - Quite popular with vegetarians in the group.\n6. Paella - Ample seafood and meat, perfectly cooked! The vegeterian paella was very flavorful too.\n\n\nOutside pre-fixe menu, additionally we ordered -\n \nSangria - which flowed freely for the night, light and refreshing, but ofcourse everyone was buzzed by the end of the grand feast. \n\nDesserts - The group wanted to try most of the desserts from list, so we all shared. Ordered - Flan, Chocolate mousse, and pudding. The definite stars  were the  chocolate mousse and bread pudding, that everyone fought for. \n \nService - The service was simply outstanding! For such a large group, to serve without a hitch or moment of confusion, not ever having to wait upon the food, is in my opinion commendable. Glasses were always refilled, every attention was given to detail while serving without being intrusive. The head chef himself came to meet the group and gave his recommendations on what is best for the group. As we sat there chatting till late, we were never rushed to leave. Overall every one of us left very happy and impressed. \n\n\nPROS - \n1. Great food\n2. For vegetarians they have many options. Also they offered to replace any appetizers from pre fixe menu for any other vegetarian option in regular menu. This is always good news for our veggie friends. Such flexibility is an added bonus.\n3. Quantity of food is never a worry here, i assure. Initially our guy friends were little apprehensive about  selecting a tapas place for they boast of their large appetites and more so with infamous tapas meal portions. We also called the restaurant in advance to ensure about the quantity of portion. However this placed rocked the party and everyone left with a full happy belly.", "author": "Payal B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-02-19", "description": "We made an Open Table reservation for a Saturday night recently after reading how popular this restaurant is.  We arrived very early, however, the owner agreed to seat us which was really nice.  We were shown to a table way in the back of the rear room (the front room looked more atmospheric).  And there was a huge group that was seated right next to that table then another large table in the back of it.  Needless to say it looked claustrophobic so we asked to be moved which the owner graciously accommodated.  We were so glad we made this decision as the table seated next to the original table we were shown to was filled with a few very extremely stupidly loud men who were obviously drunk.  The noise they created was a total annoyance to not only us but to the other diners who were looking at them.  Thus, one could barely speak to one's dining companions without shouting due to these moronic, conscienceless drunks.  When they finally left after two hours later it was a total relief.\n\nThe food was quite good especially the paella (we ordered the paella a la Valenciana and the paella a la marinera).  We began with three tapas:  Empanadillas de carne, mejilones (mussels), and gambas al ajillo (prawns in garlic sauce).  The mussels were very large and plump/juicy, and the accompanying dish to put the shells could barely fit them all as it was too small; would have been better to have provided a larger dish for the shells.  Shrimp were not that many just a few in a partially spicy garlicky sauce, but the garlic could have been more as it was a bit weak tasting to me. The paellas are in smallish pans than what we're used to in Spain and in the UK.  It can only feed two people at most.  But the ingredients were a good amount, the seafood (clams, mussels, a few pieces of small squid, and prawns) were fresh; the flavor was quite tasty too. The portion was more than what we'd ordered at Los Galayos in Madrid so we were pleased. Owner's husband (I think) came around to encourage my husband to take more of the crisped rice that was at the bottom of the pan.  Some restaurants really burn the rice too much for my liking; Alegrias just did it enough.\n\nDesserts we ordered were the arroz con leche & flan; both were a nice end to a lovely meal.  We also ordered cortados which were nicer than the usual espresso since there was a layer of frothy milk on the top.\n\nWe had a simple Spanish white wine with dinner-a Muscadet.  A bit sweet but it accompanied the meal well anyhow.\n\nThe only negatives were small.  First was being shown to that awful table way in the back of the rear room and next to a bunch of loutish types.  We made a reservation two days prior so it was a bit surprising to be shown to such a poor location.  Secondly the service was erratic perhaps because the owner mentioned and apologized that staff called in sick.  However, our waiter came timely to take our order & give us our bill.  Otherwise, it was a different waiter (or waiters) who delivered our food if he wasn't around.  We had to ask for more bread & water refills.  Seems from other reviews that when they're quiet there is much better/attentive service.\n\nIn any event, we will surely be returning as there are hardly any Spanish restaurants in SF especially one that is family-owned.  And one that has fair prices.", "author": "Luisa T."}

With that said, i decided to take my bf to dinner for his birthday. I made reservations about 3 weeks in advance since I knew the place was small and I had a of 6 for a Sunday dinner at 5:30pm.\n\n(Service) - We were seated immediately in the back room away from everyone. So my first thought was cool, they are accommodating us. First 15 minuets no one came to check on us or offer water. Finally after I flagged multiple waiters down who simply kept walking by us, we were able to place our order. Since we had so much time to look at the menu we order our drinks, tapas, and food all at the same time before they forgot about us again. at the end of dinner I tried to discreetly find a waiter to order a dessert so we could sing Happy birthday. It took me 10 min hunt one down in the kitchen. It took them another 15 min to bring the small piece of flan out.  Needless to say, the service was not up to par.\n\n(food) -  The food was okay. The tapas we ordered were very small (not really shareable). Thankfully we had ordered about 5 different tapas off the menu. The large paella plate was also fairly small. I had asked the waiter if the plate was shareable, and he said it was. I have shared a plate before with my bf to where it was enough for the two of us. This plate was not enough. I literally stopped eating so that my bf can have more because paella is a fav dish of his. \n\nGiven the price and portion size, i doubt I'll ever come back.

The other two tables were, respectively, a group of Japanese tourists taking pictures of all the schwag on the walls, and an older couple from out of town (yet another bad sign: tourist restaurant). More people did eventually come in...let's just say the place seems to appeal to the gray hair crowd.\n\nThe staff is authentically Spanish, which was positive, but the food was just off. The menu only has a handful of tapas, and their specialty is paella. So we ordered a few tapas and one of the paella dishes. The menu says it takes 30 minutes for the paella, so they obviously cook it from scratch. That said, when it showed up, it was generally pretty dry and a bit short on veggies and spices. And yes, I've been to Spain, including Valencia, and have had \"real\" paella before. This one fell short. The tapas were OK but generally unremarkable.\n\nAnd the decor seems to be circa 1987 - I don't think the place has been renovated since it opened. Generally speaking, it was an OK experience, but not among the best Spanish places in SF and not worthy of a repeat IMO despite the excellent service. In summary, I think this place needs an extensive renovation/remodeling, including the decor as well as the menu and recipe list.", "author": "Ignignot F."}

The chef has magic hands. \n\nMy husband and I then shared a squid-ink paella entree. It was OMG good. I still cannot believe how much I loved the paella. I am definitely not a paella person, but because of this particular dish, I am now. \n\nOn to the desserts. Yay! I had the panqueque (I love saying it, \"pon ke ke\").

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-02-12", "description": "Made reservations to eat dinner here with Mr. Face for an early birthday dinner when I found out that paella is his favorite dish. It was between this and one other Spanish restaurant in the city... this won by default because they take reservations. I changed the reservations around a couple of times worrying about being late. It ended up not making any difference... the place was pretty empty for a Friday night at 7pm. It kinda worried me...\n\nWe were greeted upon walking in and asked if we wanted to sit in the front or back part of the dining room. We opted for the back and were seated by a group of 4 having a girls' night, which ended up being not too great for us because we couldn't have all that much of a conversation due to them talking a lot and quite loud. I can't really blame them, but it could have been prevented since most of the restaurant was empty. \n\nThe Face and I started with ordering the Paella a la Valenciana con Chorizo Espa\u00f1ol and a pitcher of red Sangria... figured it would be better than by the glass at $5.50. I'm not much of a drinker of anything, so I maybe had the equivalent of 1 glass (Sir Face kept pouring more in my glass even though I never even got halfway) while he had most of the rest. \n\nAfter some time and bread, we also ordered the beef empanadillas and the patatas bravas. The empanadillas were delicious. The flavor was great and the barely crisp shell was made very well. One thing that can probably change, though, is that the center was just warm. The potatoes were good, but seemed to be missing just a little something... a tad more salt, maybe some more aioli... I was quite excited when the paella came out as I've never had it before. The server gave us clean plates and served the paella to us too. Even after all that... we still got more bread and I noticed that he went for a new plate for the bread as well. It wasn't necessary, but a nice touch. It was pretty good, but I don't care too much for mussels or clams... or calamari if it isn't fried. The chorizo was also a little on the dry side.\n\nOverall, great meal (despite the girls we sat next to) and great service. Someone always stopped by to check on us throughout the meal. The best part? Because I mentioned that it was for his birthday, we got a comped dessert of the flan. I didn't even notice it until the server was right behind Mr. Face lighting the candle... haha. I wouldn't mind coming by again in the future.", "author": "Nga C."}

But after circling the local blocks that many times to look for parking that dark and stormy night we weren't going anywhere else. \n\nGoodness, we ordered everything and anything that appealed to us on the menu! We were famished but we started regretting ordering all those dishes as they slowly started trickling in. We probably ended up with food enough for 4 people. \n\nThe waiter took care of us but i got the vibe from him that instead of being genuine he was one of \"those\" waiters that tell diners that \"everything is good on the menu\" when asking for his suggestions or personal favorites. And when you prod further he'd go on to suggest the most expensive entree on the menu. Pretty phony.  This is exactly why we rarely ever ask for the waiter's suggestions anymore. \nI had a glass of sangria which was watered down a smidge too much for my liking. I was glad i didnt opt for the entire pitcher being that I was barely able to finish my glass. \n\nI liked the vegetable paella. Hubs enjoyed it too so I know it's not only because I'm a veggie. It was flavorful and cooked just right.\nAwkward (but sorta entertaining) sitch that night...we watched (as well as the entire front half of the restaurant) a young girl get yelled at for talking on her cell during dinner by two older women. You couldnt help but feel bad and embarrassed for the poor girl but she was seated fairly close to other diners and the restaurant does have that cozy, dark, intimate dinner feel. It could have been the bottle of wine they were drinking but the two women kept going on about younger generation and lack of manners these days and so forth.

We discussed having tapas because we haven't tapas in awhile. My MIL even looked up the restaurant after we texted her the information. All of us were excited to be first-timers at this restaurant. \n\nThe restaurant is a great size for a SF restaurant. Dimly lit and wonderfully decorated, we arrived 10 minutes before our reservations. I had read the menu ahead of time, but again, it was hard to really choose what to eat. In the end we ordered to share for dinner:\n\nAceitunas Alinadas (x2) - Assorted marinated olives: From small to large olives we had to have two orders because they were not only meaty they were juicy and their taste was not too bitter, mostly sweet.\n\nJamon Iberico - Cured Spanish ham: Went great with the olives, the ham was not salty at all but kept you close to your prosciutto flavor.\n\nCazuela de Queso - Oven cooked goat cheese over red sauce: Goat cheese over what tasted like tomato bisque. This was an eye catcher when I looked over the menu. The cheese was not at all overwhelming and the red sauce was so creamy along with the cheese that I was in pure heaven with this dish.\n\nPulpo a la Gallega - Octopus over potato. One of  the specials of the evening. The entire table agreed that this was a brave choice by my boyfriend because it was not fried, but the taste and texture was indeed different. It was not bad at all, but neither was it the most favorite of our dishes. \n\nEmpanadilas Carne - Spanish turnovers with beef, onions, raisins and herbs: Savory to the point you didn't even taste the pastry, but it was there complementing the flavors of this dish. My FIL and I both had the same expression, we were in foodie heaven. \n\nEmpanadas de Bonit - Spanish turnovers with tuna: Another special of the evening and a running contender against its beef companion, we kept on with our curiosity and ordered this dish. Not at all fishy, but this time I got more the flavors from the pastry puff, but the tuna was not dry and it was served just right for being a turnover. \n\nPaella Valenciana - Chicken and Seafood over flavored Spanish rice: Again my FIL and I were overthrown in foodie heaven. As all of the dishes we had were overloading our palates, this dish was a combination that brought all sorts of flavors to our senses. Lucky for us we could all have second helpings of this dish.  \n\nFor dessert we each ordered the Crema Catalana , the Spanish version of creme brulee. The citrus flavors from the crust and custard gave us all goosebumps all over. I savored each bite, while my boyfriend and FIL ate it all up. And for wine we enjoyed two bottles of their Carchelo Blend (Syrah blend) complimenting all of the dishes the smooth aftertaste of the wine was both great on the nose and tongue. \n\nAnd their prices were very, very reasonable for the quality and quantity of the food they served. We paid under $200 (before tip) for the all of the above for a four top. We were all completely satisfied and I was so glad that I found Alegrias. We will be back soon on our next trip to the Marina neighborhood. Definitely a great birthday and/or date restaurant recommendation. Can't wait for our future visits.", "author": "Jamie L."}

The Paella was bad. Very bad. There was a very strong aftertaste in my mouth from the Paella that tasted like stagnant water. The rice tasted as if it was leftover rice mixed with canned tomato sauce. One of the people in my group joked that the reason why the Paella took so long to cook was because they needed time to defrost the seafood. In addition to the poor taste, I was also shocked that something of that quality costs $24.  The waitress was adamant we order 2 Paellas to split among 3 people. So we spent $48 for really crappy food. Completely. Not. Worth. It.\n\nOur shrimp with garlic sauce was also not good. I would give that 2.5 stars. To give perspective of the portion sizes, there were 8 small shrimps for ~$9 in a curry-type sauce. I am willing to pay for good food, but this wasn't good at all. Since our $48 Paella trumps our $10 shrimp, this whole review is getting 1 star. Bread was also not great, but I don't feel I can judge the bread because I have no idea what Algerian bread is supposed to taste like.\n\nThe lady at the front was very nice and accommodating (+1 star). The waitress was not very nice and very pushy with our order (-1 star). Our  2 Paella and 1 Tapas was definitely enough for 2 males and 1 female.  Either it was that the food was enough, or that nothing was really that appetizing. Sorry again for being a party pooper...\n\nFinally, I probably would have lowered my expectations if this place had 3.5 stars instead of 4, and if it was listed as $$$ instead of $$.", "author": "Jenny W."}

They've got professional, attentive staff.  But then you notice the walls have funky Spanish art.  The back half of the restaurant has billowing rolls of fabric hanging from the ceiling (which seemed odd at first, but really work with this place).  The candles providing that dim, romantic ambiance are even fake!  But put together, it all just feels genuine.  It feels like a place you want to relax in, have some wine, and talk with family and friends.  And it feels like they MAKE you focus on the food and wine.\n\nThe food makes this place happen.  Between four people, we ordered:\nGambas al ajillo - Wow.  Great stuff.  Tender, perfectly cooked.  And there's plenty of this AMAZING garlic/tomato sauce at the bottom to dip your bread in.\nEmpanadillas de carne - Also incredible.  Kind of a sweet/savory beef inside of a crispy empanada.\nTortilla de papa - Basic, but really good.  Comes with an aioli that makes it worth it.\nAsparagus - Standard.  Not oily.  Well-done.\nCalamari - Real solid.  Not oily or rubbery. \nPaella a la Valenciana - The highlight.  Tons of shellfish.  Really good flavor.  No critiques at all.\n\nI'm blanking on the dessert, but it had rum (lots of it) and they lit it on fire at the table.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-05-08", "description": "This may be the last great restaurant in San Francisco that doesn't require a one-month reservation or a one-hour wait on weekends.  Alegrias is homey, rustic, and unpretentious--and it does tapas and paellas very well. \n\nDespite that I live near Zarzuela (another good tapas bar)... \nDespite that Alegrias is in the Marina (which often precedes \"douchebag\")... \nDespite its inattentive European service...\nDespite its stale house bread...\n\nAlegrias is still my favorite Spanish restaurant in SF.  I came here a year ago, and I couldn't run back fast enough.  My girl friends and I began our girls' night out here last Friday.  We enjoyed ten tapas (two small plates a person is a good rule of thumb), a pan of paella, and two pitchers of sangria.  Delicious beginning to a delectable night! \n\nI call five of the plates my favorites here, and two of them don't even have meat (this is very unlike me).  The Manchego cheese flambed with brandy was literally on fire--I loved the fried cheese paired with the sweet spirit.  The fried potatoes tossed with alioli sauce was a light take on a classic dish.  My favorite of the favorites must have been the chorizo, potato, and caramelized onion omelette.  I adore eggs in every form, and this was no exception--fluffy, layered, savory, sweet!  I also couldn't get enough of the sauteed prawns (I even looked up the recipe for this--so easy yet so nommy!) and the crab cakes with jalapeno sauce.  I could've easily had my own portion of these and finished them like a boss.\n\nThe paella deserves its own paragraph.  It was big and glorious--a sizzling pan with a mountain of seafood, chorizo, and chicken on an ocean of saffron rice.  Don't get too many tapas if you order the paella--it will fill you up and knock you out before the check even comes.  While this isn't the best paella I've ever had, it hits the spot like a seafood risotto when you have non-Asian rice cravings.\n\nLike every restaurant, there were a few things on the menu that I could have lived without and saved money on.  The beef turnovers were unremarkable, and the stewed rabbit was bony.  This doesn't mean that I left my share, though--I still ate it while I smacked my lips!\n\nWe didn't have room for dessert, but I ordered a coffee.  Dinner ended at 9pm and we planned to be out until 2am, so I had to have a strong capuccino or embrace sleep.  The capuccino was the best decision I made that night and the best coffee I've drank outside of Italy, and it kept me wired until 3am.  I danced my way home on foot after I outlasted the lights of MatrixFillmore.\n\nI hope it's not another year before I return here.  Delicioso!  Otra vez!", "author": "Liz T."}

The broth they were in was way too good. I used my side of bread to soak it all up. Crab cakes were yummy but had only 2. The empanadas weren't memorable. Fairly standard. \n\nThe paella was amazing!

They don't shy away from rabbit, snails and all the other delicious scary-to-the-average-american Iberian delights, either.\n\nFor me, the hallmark of a great Spanish restaurant is a perfectly cooked, tender paella that showcases tasty meat and shellfish and I'd say theirs is spot-on.

Alegrias hit the spot on that count with the many veg options helpfully marked out in the menu with a dot against their name. We went for dinner at around 6:30pm on a weekend. The front room was pretty full already. We were ushered into the rear room which was very beautifully decorated. This restaurant would suit nicely for a romantic date. However, we didn't feel out of place with our young (and very well behaved) children. Service was helpful and attentive.\nWe ordered the mushrooms and garlic dish, the grilled/roasted asparagus, and a double order of the vegetarian empanadillas. I also asked for a glass of their Sangria. Some sliced crusty bread (canape size) was brought out first. My family wanted to dig in, but I pointed out we may need some bread to pile our tapas on. Sure enough, the mushrooms came with a lot of delectable pan sauce and we had to ask for another serving of bread to sop up all the juices. The asparagus was tender and not overcooked. Everything was perfectly seasoned. The empanada filling was yummy with lots of green olives. It also had some soy meat substitute. Though I am not a fan of meat substitute, the sparing use of it here was well received. The crew was still hungry and since we hadn't planed ahead to order the veg paella, we ordered yet another order of empanadillas.\nThe sangria was really well executed. No watery, flavorless, icky sweet version this. It had a robust citrus flavor, a good hit of alcohol and perfectly chilled. When it arrived, I thought that perhaps the serving could have been larger, but by the time we finished our meal, I realized something this good is best enjoyed in moderation.

I went with a very large group (around 15 people) last night, with a fixed menu due to the size.  The restaurant is understated, romantic, and has a very comfortable ambiance.  The food was really solid.  What I liked about it was that we had a big group, and everybody had several tapas that they really liked.  Plenty of vegetarian options, which aren't my thing so much but went over well.  I thought the calamari, shrimp, and new potatoes were excellent.  The vegetarians in our group went wild for the olives provided on the table, the mushrooms, and the omelettes.  Sangria was good, and the refills for our fixed menu were extremely generous.  My glass was never less than half full.  They were very accommodating to our large group, but I think that it would be just as good a choice for a romantic date night.  \n\nWhile the vibe was definitely \"tapas\", it had a more elegant and intimate feel than many other tapas places I've been to in SF, many of which are noisier and have a more communal/\"fun night out\" vibe.\n\nI would definitely come back.", "author": "James S."}

On a Thursday night, I was expecting it to be packed but it wasn't too busy. It's the perfect place for a date-night or a quiet dinner and last night there were a lot of couples there. We felt bad because we're a bit of a rowdy bunch when we all get together and we didn't want to ruin their dinner, haha.\n\nAlegria's serves tapas style. We were served bread for starters and they had extra virgin olive oil for dipping. We ordered:\n\n-Patatas Alioli; fried potatoes in an aioli sauce, really crispy and the sauce was delicious\n-Bocadillos de Cangrejo; crabcakes in a creamy jalapeno sauce, melt-in- your-mouth good!\n-Tortilla a La Espanola; potato and carmelized onion omelette, this was our favorite of the two omelettes, the sauce on top is awesome\n-Tortilla de Chorizo; potato, carmelized onion, and chorizo omelette\n-Manchego Flambeado; cheese flambe with brandy, great presentation and the cheese was really melty and creamy\n-Gambas al Ajillo; shrimp in a garlic and wine sauce, garlic and wine sauce was tasty and perfect for dipping with the bread\n\nWe all shared the tapas and our favorites were the patatas alioli, bocadillos de cangrejo, and the gambas al ajillo. We did like both of the omelettes but the tortilla de chorizo, while pretty good, was a bit of an overkill. The crabcakes were definitely one of the best I've had and I'd recommend ordering a couple plates because they only come in two's. \n\nFor dessert we shared the panqueques de manzana and some kind of cake with a raspberry sauce but I can't remember what it's called. The panqueques were sweet and you could really taste the rum and the apple.\n\nService was great! Our server was very knowledgeable, attentive and explained everything on the menu. \n\nAlegria's is a great for sharing and trying different tapas.

Tonight was especially great because my birthday dinner with 16 guests took place there...\n\nFrom planning the event through carrying it out, the Alegrias experience was fantastic. Because the group was more than 10 people, we were required to partake of the Prix Fixe menu which has two options:\n\n1. Salad + 9 tapas for $28.00+tax+tip\n2. Salad + 9 tapas+paella for $36.00+tax+tip\n\nOur group went with the paella option and we couldn't have been happier. Even one of my guests who is a born and raised Madrilean said that the food really tasted like we were in Madrid. He especially loved the tortilla espanola. The tapas were fresh off the grill/stove/oven and delicious: patatas aioli, shrimp, mushrooms, sausages, olives, tortilla espanola, etc. The crowning jewel was the exquisite paella - just the right texture and taste. Everyone in the group loooved the food and we had so much that they still gave us a big platter of paella to go. We were stuffed...\n\nThe sangria received rave reviews from the crowd as well...\n\nWe also had superb service with the owner (Cesar) and the waitstaff constantly checking on us and attending to our every need. Cesar chatted with me several times on the phone as I planned the event and really made sure that every detail and need was covered.

Three years ago, I had my very first tapa dish here and I thought it was the best thing ever. \n\nIt was Eugenia G.'s birthday, in which, she held a small and intimate celebration at this cozy restaurant.

A few members from the party did the ordering and I was having much pleasure tasting each dish that was brought to our table. \n\nSince then, I did venture out to try other tapa restaurants. Every now and then I would even come back to Alegrias for more rounds of their dishes but after trying new places, I've come to realized that Alegrias is good but not great. \n\nThey have a moderate selection of cold and hot tapas, and they also serve entrees. I usually order a few tapa dishes, followed by a paella to share. \n\nSome of my all time favorites from their menu: \n- Jamon Serrano: Imported Spanish cured ham \n- Cazuela de Queso de Cabra: Oven baked goat cheese on a bed of red sauce \n- Calamares Fritos con Alioli: Fried calamares served with alioli sauce \n- Paella a la Valenciana: Classic saffron flavored Spanish rice with chicken and seafood \n\nI guess it's true when they say \"You will always find new interests, but you'll never forget your first.\"", "author": "Jenny K."}

If only it can be added into the dictionary...\n\nI have never witnessed a restaurant more barren and mediocre. I went there with a friend and it turned out to be memorable for being particularly unmemorable - awkward service, sub-par food, and a rather sinister ambiance. \n\nOur waiter was much older with a condescending demeanor and a countenance that could surpass that of Robert De Niro in Meet the Parents - unwelcoming and irritated. He also maintained an abnormally close distance to the two of us that we always felt a bit \"watched.\" Yes, definitely creepy. \n\nThe food wasn't horrible or inedible, just very plain and flavor-less. We tried to justify it by thinking we might have ordered poorly but we ordered at least 6 items on their menu and not even one was particularly noteworthy! We ordered the prawns, mussels, the crisp fried potatoes, fried calamari, crab cakes and the seafood & chicken paella. I suppose out of all the items, the better ones were the crab cakes and crisp fried potatoes. Everything else was a completely unmemorable miss. \n\nLastly, the ambiance is clearly authentic but somehow ends up feeling a bit sinister. I think it must have been a combination of the creepy waiter, the completely red theme and the fact that we were one of the only ones in the restaurant on an allegedly busy Friday night. \n\nSo although it probably wasn't the worst experience ever, you're better off checking out one of the other million tapas places in the city.", "author": "Priya S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-02-15", "description": "Went here as part of the perpetual search for great paella. Turns out a lot more is happening here, too, to wit:\n\n1.Empanadillas de Carne: these can be found with many seasonings, depending on the country of origin, but what a winner this one is! The lightness and delicacy of the crust, together with the richness of the filling, makes this version a must.\n\n2.Escalivada (grilled eggplant/onions/peppers):  exotic with a light flavor of smoke from the grilling, plus the gentle sweetness added by the oil/sherry vinegar combination. Best bread topping yet!\n\n3. Pimientos del piquillo rellenos con cordero (peppers stuffed with lamb): the peppers are similar to those found in a Mexican relleno, but softer in texture and more delicately flavored. The lamb stuffing was very rich, but not with the characteristic lamb aroma. This will thrill some and disappoint others. I personally love grilled lamb chops with the taste of olive oil, sage, and garlic, and lots of lamb aroma, and I still loved this. In other words, I think this dish will please most everyone.\n\n4. The staff: everyone was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about the dishes on offer. The owner/chef met us on the way out and solicited our feedback (we had raved about the empanadillas and I guess the word got out). He's a super guy if you get to talk to him, and clearly (justifiably) proud of his culinary achievements.\n\n5. Oh yeah, the paella: We had the Marinera (no sausage or chicken). This one's all about the fish. Very slight saffron character in the rice, shrimp very fresh and minimally (correctly) cooked, fish and mussels super fresh and imparting the brine and mineral of the sea to the sauce. Wow. Great purity of seafood flavors, which is in my opinion not possible with chicken or sausage in the mix.\n\nHence, 5 stars. Thanks!", "author": "Leonard S."}

We opted for the group menu and a couple of pitchers of sangria.\n\nUnfortunately, the sangria wasn't as strong as I'd hoped.  We started with bread, olive oil/balsamic, and aceitunas (olives).\n\nThe first course was a salad with candied pecans - pretty standard.

With a squeeze of lemon, some extra salt and pepper, it tastes extra satisfying when you're craving carbs at the end of the meal (especially after a ton of sangria).  I wish it had a crust on the bottom, though.\n\nThey were nice enough to let us bring in our own cupcakes for the birthday girl without extra charges.  Service-wise, they were really good about clearing extra plates from our table.  The food wasn't overly greasy, and the selection of menu items are very traditional but were done pretty well.  \n\nFor all the food, sangria, tax/tip, it ended up being $54/person, which I thought was super reasonable.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-01-12", "description": "If this is authentic Spanish Cuisine, then, I am disappointed about what the Spanish or Basque culture has to offer to cuisine.  Quite sad given that my own ethnicity is part Spanish and part Basque.\n\nBefore I slam this restaurant regrettably for being pretty lousy, I will preface by saying the service was superb and the staff was very friendly.  But I do not spend $90+ for two for nice and friendly people.  Hey if you want smiles and friendly and hospitable service, you'll get a bargain at this place; a bargain if you don't really care about what you're eating.\n\nFor appetizers, my good friend and I had crab cakes which were not bad (hmm, I had no idea that crabcakes were Spanish/Basque cuisine.....)  The accompanying tartar-ish sauce not bad but a little too McDonald's \"Special Sauce\" to my pallette.\n\nBut, for the main dish, I had the combination paella valencia something or another and it was horrible.  I love Paella and \"Vigo's Authentic Valenciana\", a cook on your own packaged Paella that you can buy at Safeway for less than $5 and takes 25 minutes to cook tastes significantly better.\n\nHere, you pay $20 for this paella dish that is smothered with subpar prawns, fish (it had that \"cold frozen refrigerated water\" aftertaste to it), and far too many mussels and clams.  Because shells from clams and mussels are quite dirty and exude a polluted ocean water taste, the entire paella was completely ruined.  Oh, \"but maybe they were farmed clams and mussels\" you ask.  Sure, let's say they were farmed.  If they were farmed, they must've been farmed out of a sewage plant or somethun because they were horrible.\n\nI guess I am fed up and tired with chef's in the SF Bay Area polluting great dishes with way too many mussels and clams.  It ruins the dish.  Two mussel shells and a handful of clamshells would have been fine.  Instead, the chef at this restaurant opted to fill the paella pan with about 30 clams and mussels which ruined the already grease saturated rice.  The overly greased and buttered saturated rice: that was also what was disappointing about the dish.\n\nI've had paella in europe.  Even the paella I tried in a non-spanish speaking city (Some outdoor market in, HELSINKI,  by the Fishmarket near Esplanade) tasted way better than this crap.\n\nMy good friend and I had to walk 2 miles along Chestnut, Fillmore and Union Street to sweat out the toxins from the polluted shrimp tail shells, mussel shells, and clam shells.  The Chai Tea Late, from the empty starbucks we went to on Chestnut, barely sufficed in clearing my pallette of that horrid paellaean ordeal.\n\nThis is a word of wisdom to all San Franciscan Chefs:\n\nMussels taste horrible when served in excess.  Just two.  No more.  Have I made my point clear?\n\nSadly disappointed.  I doubt that I'll come here again.\n\nThat being said, the atmosphere isn't as horrible as the food.  Not sensational either.  I felt as if everyone eating there were eavesdroppers.  I find eavesdroppers to be unsettling like how I find too many mussels in my paella unsettling.\n\nI am starting to skeptically think that there are no good establishments to eat at in San Francisco.  I hope that changes the next time I venture to the city.\n\nFinally: the Malbec wine:  the first glass was short -filled and I was charged $9.75 for a 1/4 of a glass of Argentinian wine?  When it wasn't top quality Malbec? \n\nJust too many disappointments.  I'm gonna be more judgemental and harsher in my scoring of this place just because there are too many establishments around there for the experience to be even the slightest bit disappointed.", "author": "Tony U."}

Their recent trip to Spain inspired an idea: TAPAS.  Between my Dad's diabetes and Mom's appetite that rivals that of Nicole Richie's, I thought it best to stay with small portions.  A search of TAPAS on the Talk boards and the general Search function yielded a wealth of recommendations.  Bocadillos didn't take reservations and I didn't think the elders would appreciate the raucous din that is Cha Cha Cha's.  So Alegria's it was.  And what a wise choice.  \n\nOur waiter let me practice my substandard Spanish--I found myself saying \"Mas despacio\" or \"slower please\" and \"Como se dice..\" or \"How do you say...\" throughout our very stilted and time consuming conversation.  But it was fun and I thought he showed remarkable restraint--I'm sure he was silently saying, \"Bitch.  Please.  Order already.\"\n\nOur meal was authentically Spanish, as reported by my parents who had recently made a trip to Barcelona.  The sangria was good, though not the best I've had.  But the 10-year old madeira was amazing and worth its pricetag ($12 for a teensy glass, not more than the amount of a shotglass).  The dishes were classically tapas-sized small and our party of six had to order two servings of several of the dishes as recommended by our ever-patient waiter.  \n\nMy favorite was the empanadillas de carne which were crunchy meat-filled empanadas with lots of flavor and surprisingly light for being fried.  The calamari with aioli sauce was tender and perfectly cooked, as were the crab cakes.  The paella was moist and seasoned just right and with quality, fresh ingredients--chorizo, clams, shrimp and chicken.   I wasn't keen on the pinchos morunos--pork loin skewers--which were a bit on the dry end.  My desert, panqueques de dulce de leche--caramel filled crepes--too sweet and rich, I should've gotten it a la mode to cut the richness.  \n\nAll in all, a five-star experience for the memorable service, flavorful food and for my parents who, after 36 years, still manage to give each other 5 stars!", "author": "Joc V."}

We ordered the crab cakes which I thought was pretty good but the bf said it would have been better if they put more crab in it. We also ordered their potatoes... They were soooo good. I think I engulfed the whole plate by myself =) We also ordered the seafood paella, which came in a pretty huge portion. It was ok, nothing too special.\n\nSo overall, this place was ok... I would definitely go back for the potatoes and sangria =) This place is good for groups because it's tapa style and if you go in a group you can order a variety of things on the menu to try", "author": "Daisy W."}

For dinner we had the following items:\n\nChorizos Espa\u00f1oles (Assorted cured Spanish style sausages)- a nice sampling of different types of chorizos: I love cured meats so I was a fan. \n\nEmpanadillas Vegetarianas (Vegetarian Spanish style turnovers stuffed with soy based vegi-meat, egg, green onions, olives, raisins, and herbs): This was one of my favorite dishes of the night. It tasted like there was meat inside even though it is vegetarian. Crispy outer shell, steaming hot sweet stuffing inside. mm\n\nMejillones Alegrias (Steamed mussels in a white Rioja wine, garlic, and parsley sauce) - similar to that of B44's, not particularly special. \n\nSetas al Ajillo (Mushrooms sauteed in garlic and white Rioja wine)- this dish was good, but nothing spectacular or particularly interesting. \n\nCallos a la Madrile\u00f1a (Tripe in traditional Madrid style)- I've only had Chinese style tripe but I must say this dish was really tender and flavorful. Tripe was nice and juicy, not tough or rubbery. \n\nPatatas Bravas (Crisp fried potatoes with a spicy red sauce): not exactly spicy, but the potatoes were nicely browned and crispy. \n\nPimientos del Piquillo Rellenos con Cordero (Spanish piquillo peppers stuffed with lamb): Another one of my favorites of the night! This was absolutely delicious, stuffed peppers at other places do not compare. \n\nPaella a la Valenciana con Chorizo Espa\u00f1ol (Classic saffron flavored Spanish rice with chicken and seafood and imported Spanish chorizo): very flavorful and was the right amount of juiciness (I really hate too dry or too wet paellas)...plenty of seafood heaped on top, bits of chorizo and chicken here and there. One of the better paella's I've had. \n\nSpecial for the day: crispy sauteed frog - Mmmmm, the frog legs were HUGE! First thing I thought was dang...those are some muscular frogs. The meat was super tender and juicy under the crispy skin. But poor froggies :(\n\nCute decor, Sangria was good but not quite as good as Cascal's.

I also love the \"romantic\" lighting and the string lights they put on the wall. The place is perfectly lit, not too bright that it's losing the \"mood\", but not too dark that you can't see what you are eating. \n\nFor tapas, we ordered Assorted marinated olive ($5.25), Snails and Manila clams ($9.95), Fried calamares ($9.95), and two specials of the day: Lamb ($9.95) and Sausage (forgot the $). Among these dishes, I love the lamb and snails the most! They were delicious! Unfortunately, the clams were overcooked and had sand in them... quite disappointed! But the sauce was really good as a dipping for the bread. The calamares was yummy too, but it was common and pricey for the portion. The sausage was not that good, tasted very similar to Chinese sausage but not as good. \n\nThe House Sangria was excellent! It is THE DRINK when you come here. We ordered a paella with seafood ($19.95). The portion is a little smaller than I expected, but it tasted very well. The rice is perfectly cooked (unlike some places that make the rice too soft.).\n\nMy overall experience here was pleasant and satisfied.

The flambed manchego and the crab cakes were also tasty, but nothing incredibly special.\n\nSlightly on the pricey side for tapas, with most dishes going for $7-$10 each.  The paella was also a pretty small portion for $20.  And since it's in the Marina, it's a little hard to get to unless you want to drive, in which case you have to go light on the sangria.

One tapa will be about $8-10 and you will need at least four or five to feed 2 people unless you have a small appetite.\n\nI would love to come back here if I were going out for a night with the girls or a birthday celebration.

Croquetas del dia - Croquettes of the day (Prawn)\n\nNot bad! Once again, served with Alioli sauce.\n\n5. Pulpo a la Gallega - Poached octopus with potatoes, Spanish extra virgin olive oil, and paprika\n\nI was not sure what to make of the octopus. Flavorless! Skipped!\n\n6. Patatas Bravas - Crisp fried potatoes with a spicy red sauce\n\nHmmm! Bravas is my comfort item as such, I like prefer my potatoes to be medium size cut, crispy with a generous amount of sauce. Alegrias needs to stick to a more traditional approach instead of favoring differentiation.\n\n7. Conejo a la Cazuela - Stewed rabbit with vegetables and wine\n\nYummm! The highlight of the night. Fantastic taste and texture!!!\n\n8. Paella a la Valenciana - Classic saffron flavored Spanish rice with chicken and seafood\n\nGood! Even better as left-over the next day! ...=)\n\n9.

Within an hour, the place was packed and we started to miss the quiet moments when we first sat down. \n\nWe liked every small plate that we ordered, but some of our favorites were the omelette and the manchego cheese flambe! We ordered the apple crepe for dessert, but it tasted like a shot of rum (maybe we should have let it burn longer), so they gladly swapped it for the bread pudding.\n\nOur wine was just okay. They did not have much selection from California, so we picked a spanish red that the server recommended.

I felt like I had stepped into someone's little country home basement with dark lighting, old linoleum tile floor, metal chairs with old dark red and floral patterned covers - a little disconnect with the type of food and ambiance I usually associate with tapas.  That being said, the service and food were decent but not special enough for a return.   Sangria was unfortunately weak and watered down.  \n\nWith a party of 8, we got to try a fair portion of the menu.  Cold and hot tapas ranged from $7-10 each, with entrees and paellas around $20 each.  Individually each dish was pretty good, but a lot of the same flavors (as you can see, garlic and white rioja wine sauce was quite the constant ingredient).  \n\nBe sure to order your paella early -- we had two orders of the Paella a la Valencia con Chorizo Espanol - delicious flavorful moist saffron rice with mussels, clams, chorizo, chicken.  My fav dish of the night.  For tapas, we shared (from tasty to not-so-tasty):\n- Manchego Flambeado - set on fire tableside and just as delicious as it was entertaining\n- Oven cooked goat cheese in a red tomato sauce - I love goat cheese, but this may not be for everyone\n- Empanadillas de Carne - tasty standard with delicious beef filling\n- Steamed mussels in white Rioja wine sauce - yum!  \n- Mushrooms in garlic in white Rioja wine - yum!\n- Prawns in whie Rioja sauce with garlic and parsley\n- Tortilla a la Espanola - slightly dry potato and onion omelette\n- Croquetas al dia - filled with a weird paste of supposed serrano ham & shrimp.\n\nI'll continue trying different tapas joints before coming back here.", "author": "Heather s."}

Some dishes were really good (Zarzuela de Mariscos), others were not as good as Bocadillos (tripe stew), and portions were good for the appetizers but too small for the main dishes. \n\nSauteed Spinach- Lots of garlic, golden raisins, pine nuts, and sauteed apple chunks- sweet and savory--surprisingly good. Nice green addition to the mostly meat/fish and potato-based menu.\n\nTripe- Yummy but only if you really like tripe and it does have an intestine-ish smell so if you are skirmish about that stuff I wouldn't recommend this dish. I really like tripe and this was a pretty good version of a Spanish tripe stew--tomato based sauce, blood sausage pieces. But I would say that Bocadillos' tripe stew isbetter. \n\nFrog Leg's- batttered, seasoned, and fried until crispy and delicious! Perfectly cooked and well-seasoned.\n\nZarzuela de Mariscos- A delicious seafood stew with chunks of white fish, shrimp, and mussels-- great tomato-based broth with subtle white wine flavor. Very well flavored, lots of seafood flavor.  Only issue with this is that it's a main plate for 21.95  but it was pretty darn small.  \n\nAltogether a casual and kind of charming place with pretty yummy tapas, though I wouldn't say the best I've ever had.", "author": "amy k."}

They had just opened the door, and promptly seated our party of 5, then brought menus and water for all, and we began to order many tapas.  There was no delay in delivering the first of our choices.  Each choice of ours was nicely prepared, and fresh to boot.  Our waitperson (Laueano) delivered each dish with a nice pace, so our group could sample each one and then order another (or a repeat of one just finished).  One Yelper -- I read -- complained about the Sangria being \"watery\".  We had a pitcher, for us four adults, and it was fresh and flavorful.  It should not be a strong drink, but refreshing.  We all had desserts too, and mine was called \"cream Catalan\", kind of like a creme brulee, but infused with orange spices.  Wonderful.  We finished our meal with a very satisfied feeling.  I would have given 5 stars just for the food and the experience, but the seemingly high prices, for us, was a little steep plus the portions are a little small so we ordered 9 tapas in all, plus the four desserts.  We are from Sonoma county, and are not used to City pricing or cuisine.  Overall, they did a great job and it was a fun evening for us.", "author": "Marshall W."}

Reservations were a cinch with Opentable.  Only drawback ... they only have one \"L\" in their name [and I am a very bad spaller]. \n\nWe ordered about 12 - 15 Tapas.  Our favorites:  Rabbit, Serrano Ham, Little Fishes, Some kind of Cheese that was set on Fire, and Tripe!  All of the flavors were wonderfully done.  Not over salted like at some other places.  We also had the empanada's de carne; but it was a little sweet [which I think might be the proper way of doing it] for us.\n\nWe also ordered the Paella with the Spanish Chorizo's.  It was perfectly cooked.  We have been hesitant to eat Paella at Zarzuela's [we love Zarzuela's too, but their paella is not good]; but at Alegrias, I think the Paella was definitely a highlight.  The chicken in the Paella was tender and juicy ... somewhat shocking as Western cuisine typically uses white breast meat that tends to be too dry.\n\nWe ordered two pitchers of Sangria.  That was great too as it wasn't watered down by the ice.  I think that Alegria probably chills the wine before they mix it with the fruit juices and ice so that the ice does not excessively melt.  PROPER!\n\nWe ordered the crepe with caramel for dessert.  It was only so-so because the caramel was a bit sweet for us [but I think that's our fault for not being dessert people].  One of the people in my party really enjoyed the Flan; i think I probably should have gotten that.\n\nService was great, they did not harass you with excessive attention, but also did not ignore us.  Overall a near perfect night ... we were the only ones there by the end of that Sunday night.\n\nI will definitely be coming back.

The paella was generally good, though the shrimp looked dry.  The rice could have used more texture from my perspective.  I tried a mussel, and it was good.  The chorizo was excellent.\n\nService is very good, and they keep the bread coming, which is critical.

I have visited spain and also have done my fair share of tapas bars locally. This one was just alright. \nThe portions were reallllllllly tiny. I know that is what people  usually expect with Tapas, but in spain they are not that small and my other favorite tapas bar, SABOR OF SPAIN in SAN RAFAEL is WAYYY better than this place! They have bigger plates and also the prices are far more fair.\nI wouldnt go back here. Honestly there wasnt too much to choose from on their menu.

This persons grandmother has nephews that wear matching black shirts with aprons around their waist and walk around welcoming strangers and pouring water for them. \n\nThey're good at deep frying here; both the croquettes and the crab cakes are done to the right crispness. They have a croquette of the day here, which is cool because anyone will give you a soup of the day, but I've never been to another place that will find something new to deep fry for you each day of the week. The crab cakes are sweet and tender underneath the deep fried goodness.\n\nImagine you started to make lasagna but forgot to buy noodles or meat or parmesan cheese and you ended up baking some ricotta cheese in pasta sauce; that's about what the baked goat cheese was like. Not at all goaty like I was expecting. The shrimp is not bad, but not a must have either.\n\nThe seafood paella is rich and moist and generous with the seafood. Get it unless you're allergic to seafood or you mainly just order paella for the rice. \n\nI didn't have a Spanish grandmother; I had a stern WASPy grandmother and a perfectly stereotypical Jewish grandmother.

While its food is representative of Spanish food, our experience did not merit ranking Alegrias among the best tapas restaurants in the city.  The price to value ratio is a bit high.  Zarzuela is a better bet.***\n__________________________________________________\n\nMy wife and I went to Alegrias last night for dinner and sat in the table for two in the front of the restaurant.  The curtains over the window mostly hid the the lovely neon parking garage across Lombard.  Our ordering was a bit on the tame side as I'm avoiding meat in an effort to lose some of the  subcutaneous insulation I built up over the holidays.  \nOur menu consisted of:\n\n*Tortilla De Chorizo  $9.95\nClassic Spanish potato, caramelized onion, and Spanish chorizo omelette.\n-- Pretty standard, though at the bottom of the \"standard\" range.  Pretty clearly reheated prior to serving.  A bit dry?\n\n*Calamares Fritos con Alioli $9.95\nFried calamari with aioli sauce.\n--Great aioli.  We took the little ramekin of aioli off of the plate and made good use of it until the sauce was no more.  The calamari was good and crispy, not terribly oily.\n\n*Patatas Bravas $6.95\nCrisp potatoes with spicy red sauce.\n--Unlike any patatas bravas I've ever had.  Totally lame cubes of potato (like the kind that is served with corned beef hash), fried, and served with what was basically a marinara sauce.  Lame; especially since we paid nearly $7 dollars for this mound of disappointment...\n\n*Espinacas a la Catalana $7.50\nSauteed spinach with garlic, raisins, apple, and pine nuts.\n-- This was one of the better dishes, though I felt the spinach was a bit over-cooked and the pine nuts would have benefited from a bit of toasting.  A good mix of flavors.\n\n*Mejillones Alegrias $8.95\nSteamed Mussels in a white wine, garlic, and parsley sauce.\n--This was a highlight.  Though the mussels were a bit on the small side for the West Coast, the broth they were served in was very good.  If I weren't trying to restrict my caloric intake I would have savaged the bread plate and mopped up every last drop of liquid goodness in the bowl.  Then again, I'm like that when it comes to mussels.\n\n*Pimientos Del Piqullo Rellenos  $9.95\nCon Cordero Spanish piquillo peppers stuffed with lamb.\n-- The texture on this dish was great, though sadly the lamb was chopped fine (like hamburger) and the flavor was way, way in the background.  Did they rinse the meat after cooking?  The sauce didn't add much to the dish, and had the consistency of melted Velveeta.  This dish fell far short of my expectations.\n\nMy wife had a glass of sangria which was perfect- sweet and with a nice kick, and I started with a glass of fino sherry followed by a nice big balloon glass full of Rioja.  Rioja is one of my favorite wines, and I loved this one.  I wish I could remember what it was, but I think it was the 2003 Bodegas y Viedos Pujanza Rioja.  For reviews see: http://www.cellartracker.com/wine.asp?iWine=275384 \n\nOur service was good and well-paced, though we were asked if we were ready to order after having our menus for two minutes, and a few times I found myself searching for our waiter.  The atmosphere has Spanish accents and is homey, though as we sat in the far front we didn't get to see the rest of the place.  It looked like there was a back room which had more atmosphere.  If I had to do it again, I would sit farther back in the restaurant. \n\nAs a silly aside, the people sitting at the table next to us, a couple in their late 40s had a series of increasingly ridiculous conversations that would have made Woody Allen proud.  They covered Tibetan antiques and their worth to thieves, culminating in a conversation about whether the phrase \"Indian-giving\" might be offensive and where it could have come from.  Our conversation was far more pedestrian by comparison.", "author": "Chad T."}

We started with Escalivada, a perfect mix of grilled eggplant, peppers and onions with a sherry vinegar reduction.  The balance of flavors was just right. Oh, and we enjoyed a simple, yet very refreshing Rioja blanco which was a nice complement. Our waiter, Wilko from Mallorca was very friendly and his service was top-notch.  \n\nNext up was a series of winners, from the nicely spicy and addictive  Patatas Bravas, to the Pinchos Morunos (pork skewers in some sort of awesome Moorish marinade), the ham and chicken Croquetas (which were perfectly crispy and non-oily, yet keeping the hot oozing wonder inside)....and finally, the stand-out dish, the Espinicas a la Catalana - a very creative take on sauteed spinach with garlic, raisins, apple and pine nuts providing a great sweet/savory mix.\n\nThough not a dessert fan, we tried their bread pudding with a berry sauce which was definitely a highlight and will be a must order when I return. Oh, and I had a 5-year Madeira which matched really well.\n\nWe had brought our own wine as I had a special bottle of Spanish wine I wanted to drink and they were very gracious and immediately decanted it. We even had the chef Cesar (also the owner) come out and try the wine as I'd met him on past visits and he's a big wine lover.  More importantly, he spent at least 5 minutes chatting with us in the middle of a busy Sat. night.  Though I had not been there in well over one year, he immediately remembered me as 'the wine guy'.  \n\nAsk to meet the Cesar, chef/owner on your next visit.  The food is superb, authentic and memorable....made even better that it is an unpretentious, casual atmosphere.\n\nIf you want some of the best Spanish food in all of the city, definitely check out Alegrias. And yes, it's a homey, slightly-dated feel, but that's also part of it's charm and I urge you to look beyond that and try the food and experience a real family restaurant.", "author": "Don D."}

The dressing was a bit too sweet so I'm glad I ordered it on the side and used a light drizzle of olive oil instead.\n-Pimientos Piquillo - These were just ok. The quantity of lamb meat included was less than expected and the sauce didn't have any special flavors that I would expect.\n-Cazuela De Queso - This was the best dish to me, but that's because I love goat cheese!\n-Patatas Alioli - My boyfriend enjoyed this dish the best - the potatoes definitely had a lot of flavor.\n-Paella Verduras - As the entree, it was sad that we both picked at it and left more behind on the plate than we ate. \n\nService:\nThe service was friendly. Although near the end it took a while to find someone to clear the table and ask for a check.\n\nAtmosphere: \nIt is a small, cozy place - dishes and photographs cover the walls, floor length chair covers dress the chairs, and a small votive candle dances on each table.\n\nPrice:\nAs others mentioned, the price range is $35 or so per person not including drinks and tip.\n\nOverall, I wasn't as impressed with this place as I thought I would. \nTip: If you want good tapas in this neighborhood, try Isa's.", "author": "Cynthia D."}

We got their fixed-menu for a group, which was actually a pretty great value.  For $25 you can have a salad and an assortment of tapas, and for $30 (the one we got), which added the paella also.  \n\nWe started w/ some nice warm bread and olive oil, it was good and enough to load up on some carbs before the tapas.  The salad was mixed greens w/ a balsamic-type dressing and walnuts, pretty good.  We then got some olives, sauteed mushrooms, tortilla a la espanola (like a fritata), grilled eggplant, prawns, fried potatoes, pork skewers, sauteed spinach, and chorizos.  My favorites were the chorizos, torta, and the pork (especially with the cubed potatoes, they're kind of like little tiny square french fries).  I liked the mushrooms, but I prefer it when they sautee them whole as opposed to cut up like they did since it's juicier that way.  The paella was great, and it was just the thing to finish the meal off...without it, we might have been hungry since it was mostly veggie tapas, but after having the paella I felt full and satisfied.\n\nThe sangria isn't bad...would have preferred it to be a tad stronger/more alcoholic, especially w/ dinner.  We started w/ it then switched later to some wine which went a lot better.  I think I'd like to come back someday and have some of their richer, non-veggie tapas...especially the meat and cheese ones.  \n\nThis place is a much better value than the tapas places I've been to in the south bay...will definitely come back!", "author": "Arlene M."}

We also ordered a special that consisted of suasages cooked with apples and onions.

I basically invited myself to an all girl's birthday party dinner and stole the show with my gluttony and thievery, most most importantly, my wit and charm.  I felt the close knitness of this all girl troupe was rather apocryphal until I was there, solidifying the last and most important member of the group.  My dear comrade who I have codenamed Huckleberry, had her birthday at this venue.  Parking was typical Marina, however we were fortunate to find a VIP spot right across the street.\n\nWalking in, I was a bit surprised.  It seemed pretty upscale with the clientele well dressed and devoid of creeps.  The restaurant was dimly lit, having an aura of rustic romance.  We were immediately led to our reserved table in the back and the waiters were very attentive, always giving us bread and watchful of our sangria pitcher.  We ordered:\n\n1.  assortment of cheese and sausage (goat, sheep, cow) - the sausages reminded me of lap cheurng (chinese sausages)  the sheep cheese was the best\n\n2.  crab cakes with jalapenos sauce - i usually don't eat crab but it was pretty good\n\n3.  steamed mussels in white wine sauce- mussels taste like nothing to me...its like eating air in object form\n\n4.  oven cooked goat cheese - very rich and very delicious\n\n5.  tripe- didn't touch\n\n6.  sauteed spinach-this was okay...just your basic spinach\n\n7.  crisp fried potatoes in alioli sauce -basically diced french fries...DELICIOUS...order 3-4 plates of this!!!\n\n8.  stewed rabbit - the rabbit was good, however, I didn't like the sauce that it was with\n\n9.  veggie empanadillas-tasted like an 8th grade taco pocket or chimmychaunga\n\n10. tortilla a la espanola-it tasted like quiche...i don't like quiche\n\n11.  paella with chicken and seafood- specialty but didn't like.  I don't know if it was the saffron or what, but it overpowered everything\n\nThe ambiance is very fun.  We went during a bunch of birthday celebrations so the night turned into the battle of the birthdays.  Basically one table would sing their obligatories, followed by ours, followed by another and we would try to top one another by who could sing in higher octaves and decibels.  I kilt it with the vocals btw.  Our table was a little cramped, especially when you have 10+ dishes, however, our waiter was very helpful and genuine.  The sangria was good, however, I went through a franzia phase which pretty much destroyed my taste for wine.  A sip of red wine just transports me to Chicago when all we had was franzia in coffee cups and nothing to wash the foul taste with.  It was a very dark time for me.  The bread was plentiful to break over, however, it seemed a little stale.  BOTTOM LINE, THE BEST DISH IS THE FRIED POTATOES.  They are french fries in minced form...so good.  I was hogging it from everyone and I do not regret it one bit.  Because I am a male, tapas doesn't do it for me when you have to share with 7 others.  I just view them as threats, little laughing hyenas.  Come here with one significant other, i emphasize, ONE other.  The price is very decent...about 28 bucks a person for 8 so I cannot complain.

The meat that they use is incredible and the service is relatively fast.  All the people who work there are really nice and the ambiance is great.  It's a good place to have an intimate dinner with friends and family or go out on a date. But the great thing is that you don't have to dress up to go there.  My favorite dishes there (I forget the Spanish names) are the tripe, chorizo, and paella. What I like about Alegrias is that it's more authentic than some of the other Spanish restaurants that I've been to.  Instead of trying to cater to people who are used to California cuisine, Alegrias seems to stay true to Spanish cuisine which makes eating there not only more enjoyable, but educational to people who have never been to Spain.  When I want to eat out in San Francisco, Alegrias is one of my go-to places.", "author": "Astrid H."}

Three of us shared a selection of hot and cold tapas and one order of Paella.\n\nThe Gambas al Ajillo, Shrimp with garlic, parsley and white Rioja Wine, the Espinacas a la Catalana, spinach with raisins, apple, and pine nuts and the Manchego Flambeado, Manchego cheese flamed with brandy were all excellent. There are a few variations of Paella on the menu and the Paella a la Valenciana, with chicken and seafood, that we ordered merits special praise for it's subtle saffron taste (not just yellow rice), well balanced seasoning and combination of ingredients including perfectly prepared mussels, clams and shrimp. Elsewhere I have been served larger versions of Paella, but that's mostly meant more rice. Alegrias' version is packed with seafood and chicken and was still plenty to share after a selection of tapas.\n\nThe service was friendly, relaxed, but timely.", "author": "David L."}

While also serving tapas, the style is a little different, in terms of food prep. Six of us converged for dinner on a Saturday night, beating the dinner rush by about 30 minutes. Highlights included:\n\n- Seafood paella w/ chorizo - heavy on the seafood, a light on the rice. It was nice being able to add the chorizo, though it was as spicy as I had hoped for.\n- Beef empanadillas - golden-fried on the outside, chock full of flavorful beef. Definitely good stuff and medium-sized, but only 2 per order.\n- Tortilla espanola w/ chorizo - it was interesting having tortilla espanola served warm, but I liked it. Thin slices of potato with chorizo mixed in, I also liked the red sauce that came on top.\n- Patatas de alioli - instead of the almost-steak-cut fries that I'm used to getting, these potatoes came out almost like home fries, small cubes with a really tasty alioli sauce.\n- Calamares fritos con alioli - fried food is always good, even better when the calamari is accompanied by alioli sauce.\n\nOther stuff included manchego flambeado (flaming cheese a la Greek saganaki) and gambas al ajillo (shrimp sauteed w/ white wine and garlic). The sangria was pretty good and a little cheaper than Cha Cha Cha.\n\nOverall, I liked it. More intimate atmosphere with tasty food and worth coming back for more.\n\n- Gambas al ajillo.", "author": "Albert C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-02-23", "description": "A group of 5 of us ate here on a really busy Sunday night when most restaurants simply required a very long wait. We were in the area and decided that tapas sounded good and as Alegrias got good reviews we went for it. \nOn entering we were not really in love with the feel of the place as it is somewhat dated but the service, cleanliness and food proved to be fantastic.\nWe got a good spread of tapas including garlic shrimp, sheep cheese, the tortilla, asparagus and a few other things. Since we were pretty hungry with thought that adding a paella to our order would help. Usually the paella at Spanish restuarants tends to have rice that is undercooked or overcooked, or the seafood doesn't seem fresh, however at Alegrias that was not the case. While the paella is not necessarily exactly what you might find in a fine restaurant in Spain, it is certainly very good. In fact it may be one of the best ones I have had in the US.\nWe also got some Spanish wine which our waiter recommended and it was truly good. In order to finish out our great dinner we got a nice spread of desserts. The flan, pancakes with apples, pancakes with dulce de leche and some chocolate cake. The flan was pretty good but everything else was just average so perhaps save your dessert appetite for another establishment. \nSo all in all if you are looking for a carefully prepared tapas dinner with great ingredients don't hesitate to come to this restaurant.", "author": "Nadia S."}

I recently visited Alegrias for the 3rd time and it has never failed to disappoint. \n\nOf all of the Spanish places I've been to, incl. Cafe Iberico in Chicago, this continues to impress with solid food, fast and attentive service (the kind you'd expect of a tapas restaurant) and a cozy well decorated environment and should be considered among the best.\n\nOn a wet windy night we were relieved to step inside Alegrias where it was nice and warm and cozy - this felt like what it means to come inside from the storm. Even with a 7pm reservation the place was relative empty at 6:45 when we showed up so they were able to seat us right away. The restaurant is set up with a front and back room, the front containing the bar area. The walls are adorned with scenes from Spain, including photos of bullfight arenas. There are also various kinds of pottery and other flora around meant to reveal aspects of Iberian culture.\n\nI wouldn't consider myself a big Sangria drinker but that was the first thing we ordered and it came out promptly. I'd say it was sweet, but perhaps that's my uneducated Sangria palate. You could also taste the other ingredients, the brandy and citrus. I'd order it again, but I'd probably opt for a Rioja to go with my Spanish food first.\n\nWe went for the Tortilla de chorizo, patatas bravas, pinchos morunos (pork skewers), cetas al ajillo (mushrooms in garlic), and the Empanadas de Carne. All came out fairly swiftly and no single dish disappointed. The empanadas had many ingredients to compliment the meat, all of which went very well together. The pinchos morunos were moist and flavorful. I'm not a big mushroom guy but the garlic sauce made them worthwhile to me. For the next round we got the empanads de verdura ( vegetarian) and the gambas (prawns in garlic). I'm not big into shrimp but I was a big fan of these.\n\nFor dessert we had the Crema Catalan which was essentially a citrus infused Creme Brulee which was awesome! Our friends had the bread pudding - i'm not a bread pudding aficionado but i knew this tasted good and I'd highly recommend both.\n\nAbout an hour into the meal the place began to fill up but the noise level never got offensive and the service did not drop off.\n\nI've not had dinner at Zarzuella, and I'm hesitant to call Thirsty Bear authentic Spanish food but until such time I will call Alegrias my standard for tapas in the Bay Area.", "author": "Ross R."}

The Gambas were good too, but missing something-I can't help but compare them to the creamy cajun shimp dish at Cha Cha Cha's...i shouldn't, totally different tapas. The tortilla was great, something I think I could probably try to do at home for us-just no sparks in my mouth as I ate it.\n\nOverall, this is a great place to have a warm, intimate dinner.

The rabbit was so tender and well seasoned, not to mention my love for stewed tomatoes! My mom got the Pescado del Dia.. i think it was a rainbow trout but that was really good as well. We also ordered croquettes del dia (bomb.com), potatas bravas, empanadillas de carne, and tortilla espanola of course! The croquettes were ham and cheese and just like those is spain. Crumbly crunch with every bite and hot, tasty, creamy inside! The potatas bravas were nice but not too big of a fan of potatoes in general. The aioli sauce that comes on top of it def adds a the touch it needs. The tortilla espanola was a little diff from the kind my senora back in spain would make.. The texture of the kind served here was a little diff and had a more spongey tamago feel to it--meh. The Empanadillas however were soooooo good!!! I def would highly recommend those!! \n\nOverall, pretty good service, nice ambiance, great food but def a little overpriced. Tapas are small little appetizer dishes... the fact that they charge 9$ for tapas blow my mind. Based on portion size and ingredients.. those tapas shouldn't exceed more than  $5-6.", "author": "Lauren Y."}

The Escalivada was a great dish to start with. It was Grilled eggplant, peppers & onions drizzled with a Spanish sherry vinegar reduction. The vegetable tasted very sweet with a little tang and brightness from the sauce. We had also their Espinacas a la Catalana, which is Saut\u00e9ed spinach with garlic, raisins, apple, and pine nuts. I am a big fan of all the ingredients, but have never imagined putting them all together for a dish. It was quite interesting and I enjoyed it a lot. Another tapa that we liked was the Patatas Alioli. It was crisp fried potatoes tossed with a traditional aioli sauce. The sauce was a nice flavorful compliment to the potatoes. We finally had their Paella a la Valenciana con Chorizo Espa\u00f1ol - a paella with chicken, seafood and Spanish chorizo. It was full of flavor and delicious.

This would be a good dish to serve at a wine party, except I would use garlic bread or a seeded baguette. The empanadas were nice and flaky, not too doughy and packed with filling. They did a really nice job on the calamari, although I thought the batter could have used some Spanish seasoning to differentiate it from the typical calamari you can find at most seafood restaurants - but they cooked it too perfection. They also use real baby calamari with the tentacles, not the big calamari steaks which come out like chewy onion rings.

It truly is little bit of Spain in the the middle of the Marina.\r\n\r\nHowever, why did I pick this place?  Was it because I was looking for Tapas?  (no) Was it because I read yelp reviews?  (wish i could say yes)  Was there any shred of intention at all? (no)  I chose to try this place because when driving by I was completely unable to read the name of the restaurant from the sign and was therefore curious. :)\r\n\r\nIn the words of Elder Brother from Indiana Jones, I chose wisely.  In my mind, it's really hard to screw up tapas, but it's equally hard to make them exceptional.  Most places rely on copious amounts of sangria to make the normally satisfactory blend of flavors into something truly special.  But this place succeeded in completely surprising me while I was enjoy a dry evening.\r\n\r\nI had the calamari, sauteed mushrooms (don't let them take away this plate before you soak up all the excess sauce), sauteed spinach, flaming goat cheese, and the biggest surprise of all the vegetarian empanadillas (save this for last).  I swear there's so much flavor in this dish that they have to be sneaking meat in there.  Add on a glass of sangria, and you've got the perfect tapas meal.\r\n\r\nAs one of my friends pointed out, you can tell this place is going to be good simply based off of the number of people in there speaking Spanish.  But the staff really does put in the extra effort to be both attentive and accommodating.  For example, when I was there last Thursday night, they were fine with my friend and I staying past 11 to continue enjoying a great conversation, when they technically closed at 10.\r\n\r\nNext time I want tapas, or a comfortable, intimate restaurant, this will be my destination.", "author": "Miller H."}

I couldn't believe that we were one of 2 other customers, but it was a Wednesday night and there are TONS of other tapas restaurants in the city.   But none, in my opinion, as good as Alegrias.\n\nHaving just dished out tons of quarters in a parking meter---7 minutes for a quarter, are you kidding me?!  I arrived not too happy.  My friends had not yet arrived, but I was shown to our big table.  All the frustration from the past 15 minutes disappeared as I gazed at the decorations on the walls, sipped my glass of Rioja, and relaxed even more from the Spanish music playing...\n\nI can't remember exactly what we ordered---(see suggestions from other reviewers of this place because they all sound familiar) but we were all very satisfied.\n\nIt wasn't at all like my awful experience at Cesar on Piedmont.  The dishes were made with a lot of care and the owner from Argentina (her grandmother is from Spain) is a lovely woman.\n\nI would definitely come back here--either for a romantic dinner, with a group, or with guests from out of town.", "author": "Penny P."}

We had reservations for two and got seated right away. They served us some french bread when we sat down, I thought the bread was a bit tough and tasted almost stale...but didn't really care to eat too much of it because I wanted to save my stomach for the main dishes!! =) From the Hot Topas menu we tried the Empanadillas de Carne (Spanish style turnovers stuffed with beef, green onions, olives, raisins, and herbs) which was really REALLY good, came out perfect...nice and warm, crispy outside, when I first poked my fork into it to break it open the aroma smelled so delicious!!! The texture was really good you can see and taste the beef and it was nice and juicy but not to the point where it was drippy. It was SOOoooo GOOOD!! We also had the Tabla de Quesos y Chorizos Espa\u00f1oles (Assortment of cheese and cured sausage imported from Spain) from the Cold Topas menu. I am not a cheese connoisseur, but I love cheese. We had a variety of sheep, goat, and cow cheese. They were all pretty good, but my favorite was the sheep cheese can't really describe why, but it was yummier. Each came in two pretty big slices for each flavor. Would have probably tasted even better if paired with some wine. It also came with some cold Chorizos which was a bit salty for my taste but still pretty tasty. And for our main dishes we had the Chuletillas de Cordero con Patatas a lo Pobre (Grilled lamb chops with poor man potatoes and vegetables) & the Paella a la Valenciana con Chorizo Espa\u00f1ol (Classic saffron flavored Spanish rice with chicken and seafood and imported Spanish chorizo). The lamb chops were really yummy!! They made it so that it was lightly crispy on the outer edges (not crispy burnt but yummy crispy!). The seasoning was perfect, not overly seasoned so you could still taste the yummy meat. Wanted to pick up the lamb chop bones and start chewing on the meat that was still stuck on there...but didn't want to look rude, hehehe. But it was definitely finger licking good! The veggies were also just as good, loved the green beans... and the potatoes were delicious, nicely seasoned and was very smooth. I didn't know Poor man potatoes can be so good! The Paella came out last (they warned us that it was going to take 20-30mins), but we were still working on our lamb chops when it came out so it was right on-time. This tasted like a seafood pasta except with rice. It had lots of seafood: mussels, clams, shrimps, calamari...with a few pieces of white chicken meat and the sausages. The white chicken meat was a bit dry...over all the dish was ok. I'm not a big fan of pasta...nothing too spectacular about this dish. \nPros: Good Service, food came out pretty quick, nice ambiance (but we were sitting next to a pretty big crowd and it got a bit too noisy).\nCons: No parking (but you're in SF so...good luck), bread tasted stale...not a big deal but I love bread so it would have been nice if it was better.\n\nTips: Order wine with your food. =)\n\nGave 4 stars because I would definitely come back for the Empanadillas de Carne & lamb chops!!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-03-16", "description": "Spanish food is one of the things that I miss from my time in both Philippines and Europe - when I was a kid in Asia, my father and grandparents would take us out on Sundays nights for gatherings at Old Manila for croquetas, lengua (ox tongue), and sopas mariscos - and sometimes, when we're lucky and not stuffed from the food, we'd get a big wok of paella negra, which is regular seafood paella coated with squid ink.\n\nWhile it does not have certain select dishes that I crave on its menu, Alegrias comes close to capturing both the atmosphere and the flavor that I remember from those times. The service is both kind and attentive - I remember calling up twice and asking for reservations to which they politely complied to, as well as our waiters being very personable during our meals.\n\nThe d\u00e9cor of the restaurant romanticizes the experience, or at least gives a solid enough a backdrop for my nostalgia--it's ideal for a mellow romantic date, and even if the person you're out with decides that they want to eat at the (admittedly inexpensive) Chinese restaurant in Chinatown immediately after, you'll still come out smiling.\n\nI'm not particularly versed with their selection of wines, but their Sangria is tasty (unfortunately I haven't been there in a while so I cannot comment on this further). The one drawback that I find from the entire experience is the price relative to how much food you get. Don't get me wrong: the food is great, but you don't get as much as you would hope to in other restaurants. Appetizers are normally around $7.00 to $9.00, and the main dishes go to about $20 per plate. I'm not saying it's not worth it: I'm just saying that it's not wise to go here and expect it to be a cheap hangout (but maybe that's because I'm a student, I don't know). My suggestion is to sample as much of their tapas as you can, and order one paella dish (Paella a la Valenciana con Chorizo Espa\u00f1ol) if you want variety in your meals.\n\nIf you do decide to go to Alegrias, you'll find the experience to be pleasant. I would recommend trying the following:\n1. Patatas Alioli - it's basically fried potatos bits drizzled in Alioli, but it's still very good. \n2. Cazuela de Caracoles y Almejas -  Snails and Manila clams stewed in red sauce\n3. Pimientos del Piquillo Rellenos con Cordero - it's like an Indian samosa with pimiento peppers as the wrap; succulent and one of the few dishes that I find well worth its price.\n4. Croquetas del dia - one time it was ham; the other time it was chicken. Both were great.\n5. Tabla de Quesos y Chorizos Espa\u00f1oles - it's basically a sampling of cheese and sausage from Spain. Take it with wine.\n6. Paella a la Valenciana con Chorizo Espa\u00f1ol - this is, I think, my favorite paella out of the four available. It has both seafood and chicken as well as chorizos (a personal favorite).", "author": "Juan d."}

Pulling up to the place is in the sort of location that makes you think it's just one of those conveniences for tourists staying in local hotels.  After walking into the restaurant I saw the outside definitely reflected the inside.  The pictures were a poor representation of what this place actually looked like.  The chairs were these old metal cushioned chairs you would find in a hotel banquet hall in the 70's but don't worry... they were covered by pieces of fabric probably ripped right off of your great grandmothers couches.  They were all old and torn and falling apart.  \nThe menu was wrinkled and torn in places and reminded me of one of those places you take your kids because you don't care what the atmosphere is as long as they get fed and the menu was incredibly limited to a majority of fried foods.  The crab cakes were generic and cold in the center... the croquettes were crab cakes shaped like cheese sticks... the bread was cold and beginning to harden from age... the potatoes they had were just tiny french fries covered in some sort of sauce and the spinach dish was basically just a handful of overcooked spinach covered in garlic because they garlic is all you could taste.  The sangria tasted horribly watered down and there were so many orange peels in the glass then covered with ice there wasn't much room left for this poor excuse of sangria.\nAt the end of the meal I felt like I was being held hostage.  I was already thoroughly embarrassed because I was trying to take my girlfriend on a nice date that we don't get to have too many of and I ended up taking her to this Mcdonalds version of Tapas.  I had to ask for the check 4 times within 5 minutes of each other as they just kept asking me if I wanted more food.  Finally I just gave them my credit card without getting a check in hopes that they would just come back with a receipt instead of asking me again if I would like anything else.  \nLuckily my girlfriend is this wonderful woman and we recovered the night from this horrific experience.  I don't know how this place has so many glowing reviews. \nOver all Alegrias is dirty, terrible atmosphere, limited menu, terrible food, ridiculous service, and a location that just makes you cringe.  Save your money go to in and out... it's classier.", "author": "Chesh K."}

My husband and I attended a birthday party there and sampled lots of tasty plates, but my favorites were the tortilla, chorizo, and gambas. I'm not a big red wine drinker, but the sangria tastes great and is made carefully.

Still, the staff was very tolerant of people showing up late etc.\n I also appreciated the fixed menu since we had nearly 20 people in our group. Notably, it made settling the bill at the end of the night easier.  \nThe only drawback was the bill. We were quite blown away by the price per person - a little over $70, when the meal cost $36 per person.  The amount of Sangria and bottled water many of us drank made the bill much higher than expected.  Overall, it was more good than bad - food was great and the waiters kept our glasses full.

I may be a little biased because I tend not to like to commit to one meal - so the tapas idea works well for me.  It's like a sushi - I get a little taste of everything.  Tapas I would recommend:\n-Aceitunas Ali\u00f1adas (assorted marinated olives)\n-Bocadillos de Cangrejo (Crab cakes served with a mild creamy jalape\u00f1o sauce)\n- Tortilla a la Espa\u00f1ola (potato and caramelized onion omelette)\n-Gambas al Ajillo (Prawns sauteed with garlic, parsley and white Rioja wine)\n-Mejillones Alegrias (Steamed mussels in a white Rioja wine, garlic, and parsley sauce)\n-Manchego Flambeado (Spanish Manchego cheese flambe' with brandy)\n* Setas al Ajillo (Mushrooms sauteed in garlic and white Rioja wine)\n* Patatas Bravas (Crisp fried potatoes with a spicy red sauce)\n* Patatas Alioli (Crisp fried potatoes tossed with a traditional aioli sauce)\n\nAlso, the service is quick, and because it's on Lombard parking is not as tough as other parts of the city.

Because frankly I was much too busy pounding down glasses of Sangria to remember the food. \n\nHowever I do remember a couple of things:\n\n1. The food was quite good. It was a prix fix menu for the group and I'm assuming they choose the better dishes on their menu. I do remember liking a majority of the food and everyone being in agreement with me.  I also remember the paella just being so-so. But that doesn't concern me too much since MOST restaurants don't do this dish well. But quite honestly the food was homestyle and authentic. All the  dishes complement each other and the food comes out quick! They just keep bringing the dishes out one after another after another. \n\n2. The sangria was not very strong. Which is probably why were drinking them out of wine glasses like they were shots and why it's so cheap. But it's not so cheap when you keep drinking more..and more...and more...\n\nAt  the end of the night the bill was roughly $60/person. That's with drinking lots of sangria. Considering everyone was stuffed and happy, I'd say that's a pretty good deal! I'd definitely come out here again - it's great for groups and even for just two, since they have so wisely separated the loud and obnoxious groups (my group included) from those who prefer to have a \"romantic\" meal.

I expected it to be booming and even anticipated having to wait to get in, but instead it was so quiet in the middle dining room by the bar--everyone was put here, I think 3 tables had diners--that the sound of dishes and glasses clattering at the bar was unnerving.  We ordered garlic shrimp, a favorite of ours, and it was tasteless.  It did have garlic in it, but we couldn't taste it.  The little red peppers stuffed with lamb were also tasteless and half-cold to boot.  And the patatas with aioli were the oddest I've ever had--tiny little squares, homefries basically, that were tossed with the sauce (I guess so no need to dip.)  The sangria was also disappointing; I didn't even finish it.  I did feel they kept trying to get us to order more, but my instincts from the beginning were to try a few dishes and then order more if we liked them.  We didn't like them, so we left with a light bill and a lot of disappointment.  In fact, it was so bad that we decided to go out again the next night and make THAT our anniversary dinner.

None of them were that great, so i can't recommend anything on the regular menu that i have had. I expected better given that this place had a four star rating.

Sauteed mushrooms to start and a fine Zarzuela that while different than the one I loved in the SoHo Spanish restaurant in New York over 35 years ago, was just as good.  Fish and shellfish in a delicious tomato-based broth that I could not stop eating.  Soaked the very last of it into the thinly sliced bread.  Hmmmm.....  Wonderful service that was spot-on.  Enjoyed a glass of sangria that was $5.50 as I recall.  More than a fair price and not too sweet.  Also treated myself to a dessert of vanilla ice cream soaked in either sweet port or sherry with toasted pecans on top.  Just the right ending to a wonderful dinner.  Have been staying away from rice and other carbs, despite the small amount of bread I ate and dessert I succumbed to.  (:  Couldn't resist.  I'll be back...  By the way, I ate fairly early, around 7:00, and the two rooms were about 2/3 full.  When I left most of the tables were taken and more people were arriving.  Definitely a winner in my opinion.", "author": "Joshua C."}

My only disappointment for the food was the croquettes which had way too much cheese to taste any of the meat. But it was fried to perfection.    We got 2 paellas-- one seafood and one vegetarian.  Both were consistent for the flavor in the rice.  I wish the vegetarian had the veggies cut up a bit more.\n\n\n\nWhile we were there, we didn't seem to have a consistent server, but it didn't matter because everyone there responded promptly to our requests for more water, sangria, the coffee menu, etc.  The staff was very friendly -- we went for my friend's birthday and I made her a cake.  The staff brought out the cake on a plate with a doilie--- far beyond my expecation and even put candles on it (even though I had brought my own.)   They were friendly  and wonderful about the whole thing and didn't bat an eye over the fact that I brought in my own dessert.

I've been here once before for a restaurant experience project for my food & wine class. Had an excellent time and had a good talk with the owner for about half an hour about him and the restaurant. I love the fact that it's a family owned restaurant and the whole family works there. Very friendly people and they are truly from Basque country.\n\nThe atmosphere is very cozy. They can accommodate large groups or a table for two. The decor is simple and elegant with a homelike feel to it. Their bar is lined with hundreds of bottles of wine. The service was very attentive and friendly. As soon as we finished a dish, someone came by to swoop up the empty plate. They also refilled our waters quite often and we never had a dry glass. Even though we stayed and chatted after we finished dinner, we never felt like they pushed us to leave like other restaurants sometimes do. However, they weren't that busy that night anyways so I guess it didn't matter if we were lingering.\n\nThe food was excellent for the most part. We ordered the skewers that came with some good tiny french fry like potatoes. The crab cakes were also good and a pretty good portion for $10 (you get 2 which are about 2 inch in diameter). The snails & clams were delicious in the semi spicy red sauce. The mushrooms tasted like any other tapas place. We also got the fried cheese which was nothing special besides the fact that it comes flaming. We ordered the seafood paella which was enough for the 4 of us since we ordered tapas too. We were surprised at how much seafood they actually give you, which makes it well worth it. The seasonings/sauce was really good although the rice portion could have been more. For dessert we got the flaming apple crepe with ice cream. The burnt sugar sticks to your teeth, but other than that it was good. We also ordered a pitcher of the sangria which was excellent and doesn't have the bad after taste finish that I've experienced with others.\n\nGreat family owned authentic Spanish restaurant with a cozy atmosphere. Delicious food in a convenient location. Only cons are the portions are a little bit small even though they are tapas and it's a bit pricier than other places, but still good.", "author": "Linda C."}

I didn't decide on my orders because we went with a pre-fixed menu and by the time I got there, the food was just starting to come out.  I don't know whether they're just slow with the food or it took some time before everyone was seated.  I was too hungry at the time to care at that point.  So they brought out each of the tapas dishes pretty quickly one after another (I think there were around 8 dishes or so).  The portions were just about right and the food was elegant.  I enjoyed every dish they brought out and there wasn't too much to really complain about the place.  This is a very solid tapas restaurant.  We also ordered a pitcher of sangria and it was alcoholic and sweet as it should be.  At the end of the night, we each paid roughly $40 also paying for the birthday girl, so it wasn't too shabby.

My girlfriend and I sat, ate, drank, and were there for almost two hours without any push for us to give up our table.  This is a great spot to take a date beofre a night out in the City.", "author": "Mike D."}

She knows good Spanish food (her mom makes a mean Paella and Tortilla) and loves it when it's done right. Alegrias, evidently does it right. Went here for our Anniversary and were blown away. The place is very small (don't drive by) and very romantic. We started with a variety of excellent tapas, both hot and cold, with the Camarones Diabla taking the cake. We decided on the Paella Valencia and were not disappointed. This dish was absolute heaven! We've never had a Paella this good, and the best part is we were there on a Thursday night and had the place practically to ourselves (OK, there were other people there). It didn't hurt that the Sangia was incredible too. Finished off everything with an excellent Flan, and staggered back to our hotel completely satisfied (we walked, OK!).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-10-27", "description": "Disclaimer: Just because I gave five stars does not mean that I equivocate this food to the AMAZING food I had in Espana last summer. \n\nThis past wknd came with a group of 13 folks and just had an amazing, well organized, good service, good food, etc. experience. This night could have had many opportunities to turn into a disaster with so many people here, but it turned out great! Thanks to Larry our waiter (and a few others). We were originally supposed to have a smaller group but they were accomodating to increase our group size. (Some last minute folks joined in...people RSVP please...!!!!! A possible nightmare on a Friday  night)\n\nAs a result of having at least 12 people there, we had to go with the pre fixe - which I believe is a salad and 8 tapas (per group of 4). For $28/person not a bad deal (probably more food than we needed to order and I haven't done the math exactly, but it was probably priced about right (although I'm sure I could have ordered a lot less and been just as happy/full). The kitchen was nice enough to allow us to substitute two of the tapas on the pre fixe menu, as we weren't exactly the biggest fan of cold tapas (I myself am a fan generally of caliente tapas). In addition, they were super nice about letting us bring in a cake for our friend's birthday - I think they do normally charge a fee for this.\n\nWe had the escalivadas, aceitunas alinada (olives), empanadillas de carne (beef empanadas), croquettas del dia (chicken croquettes - or whatever is of the day), gambas al ajillo (shrimp), setas al ajillo (mushrooms), patatas bravas (potatoes), pinchos morunos (pork loins), ensalada de casa (house salad). \n\nWinners: Olives (if you like olives), empanadlilas, croquettas el dia, setas al ajillo, pinchos morunos, ensalada de casa (if you feel you need some fiber). Personally loved the empanadas as I like most turnover like pastries, LOVED mushrooms probably related to my most recent mushroom kick, and of course the pork loin mostly because I do like pork but it really meshed well with the croquettas because I used the potatoes on the bottom and took the aioli from the croquettas and mixed them together - I assume this would obviously be the same thing as if we had just ordered patatas aioli which we didn't - but I would next time. Not sure though I would be a fan of them putting the aioli on top vs. dipping. Loved the aioli though. OH Sangria is good, but not as good at the one in Zarzuela.\n\nNon - winners: The shrimp was a bust for me because I love fresh shrimp (as a result of my Texan roots), and this was def frozen shellfish that was overcooked. I do like my rioja sauce though...Patatas bravas just can never be good as in Espana. \n\nOverall a great experience, ESPECIALLY for large groups. They nicely put you in a back room and you can actually hear your neighbors. It's just a matter if you want to pay that much after all the sangria.", "author": "Jeannette L."}

Hadn't gone to Alegr\u00edas in a few years, so off we went.\n\nPositives: Overall, the food was very good.  The following tapas were ingested:\n                 Escalivada: delicious\n                 Pulpo (Octopus) a la gallega: noble in flavor, frugal in quantity\n                 Bunny: tender and bathed in a toothsome stew\n                 Fried Calamari: good, light/clean oil tasting\n                 Croquetas: nice texture, but it was hard to detect the jam\u00f3n serrano and shrimp that were supposedly included in the ingredients; furthermore, the \"alioli\", the same dipping sauce that accompanied the calamari, looked more like a thick thousand island sauce, and while cool and refreshing, was devoid of perceptible flavor in general and of garlic in particular\n\nNegatives:  Upon leaving I was left with an uncomfortable, unsettling spiritual sensation.  The food was decent to very good, the service was for me perfect, unhovering, dish servings well paced . . .what was the problem?  Introspection required. . .\n\nConclusions: For those not concerned with price/quality ratios, this is definitely a place that has plenty of pleasure-inducing dishes to choose from.  However, for those who like to poke with the consumer prod a bit, the wine we had is a good metaphor for this restaurant.  We each had a glass of 2006 CUNE Rioja, a quality wine in lovely large glasses that made the sweetest sound when clinged, but at $10 a not so generous pop, we ended up tallying $85 for 5 tapas, 2 glasses of wine, tax and tip.  It seems that prices here have certainly gone up a level since my last visit.  I dont think there was a bottle of dinner wine available for under $35, and the very limited by the glass offerings were at the aforementioned $10.  I've decided I would love to return if someone invited me, but for me to give a hearty suggestion to go, I would like them to turn up the lights a bit, increase the portion sizes ($9 for 4 croquetas is just wrong) and turn down the prices and the preciousness.  Much is of course an esthetic personal preference, the Zarzuela mes\u00f3n style as opposed to whatever this is supposed to be, but in the future I will channel my tapas cravings from Tue-Sat in order to enjoy more reasonably priced good wine in generic glasses with more numerous octopus disks.  After this dining experience, I was reminded of a few years back when I bought a baseball mitt I really liked after shopping around quite a bit, then realized after getting home that my wallet was $20 short because 2 spankin new bills had apparently stuck together and the clerk hadn't \"noticed\".

We went for our anniversary dinner and had several tapas (Iberica ham, tortilla espanol, stuffed peppers, olives, little sausages) and a Pallela Valenciana, along with the $36 bottle of Cava (sparkling white wine) and the Crema Catalan and an apple dessert.  It was all fantastic. The chef/owner really cares if you like the restaurant and puts a lot of care into the food.  The waiter (his son) gave good suggestions for the tapas and how much we needed to be full.  I'd recommend this to anyone looking for authentic Spanish cuisine and a lovely atmosphere.", "author": "Nicholette M."}

In addition to serving some of the yummiest paella, around there are some pretty authentic tapas from the different regions of spain.  The queso flambeado (spanish manchego cheese flambe')  is so tasty.  You must also try Callos a la Madrilea (tripe prepared Madrid style) and the tortilla espanola con chorizo.  We finally finished off the meal with a wonderful Crema Catalana (like a creme brulee, but better).  The service was friendly and helpful.  If I had anything to complain about it would be that the sangria was a bit tasteless with little to no alcohol content.  I will probably just get a nice spanish red wine the next time I go.", "author": "Doris K."}

True dishes from Spain made by the owner, Cesar, who still has a thick accent even after 30 years in the states.  We left it up to him to order his specialties and were we wowed!!  The first tapa was the Conejo a la Cazuela, which turned out to be a delicious rabbit stew in a scrumptious wine sauce.  Who knew Bugs Bunny tasted so tender!  Then we had the Tortilla a la Espanola, which was a potato omelet with a yummy sauce and roasted pepper to go with.  We also had the Gambas al Ajillo, which were large prawns with huge chucks of marinated garlic.  To complement these dishes, we chose one of the Roijas, which is a spicy red wine from Spain that they pour into a decanter at your table.  With the cream custard we had for dessert, they brought us a complimentary glass of their fab sangria.  With the cozy ambiance and the unique service, I felt as if we were in a little Spanish village instead of on Lombard Street.  Go early and you'll have the whole place to yourself...a great spot to take a pause from the hustle & bustle.", "author": "Tara G."}

The sangria is deceptively juice like (but packs a heavy punch). The paella is not bad, but the stand out dishes are the calamari (not greasy), the mushrooms, the chicken stuffed with spinach and pine nuts and the flan.", "author": "Mama L."}

One of my best friends came to town and he suggested looking up tapas on yelp and we came across Alegria's.  I am almost always eating asian food, but I thought, eh, what the heck -- the pictures on yelp looked good, so let's try it.   We ordered the crab cakes - the sauce it sat on was sooo delish!  The empanadillas de carne were buttery/flakey and very tasty.  The patatas aioli made both of us soooooooo happy.  It was the \"eyes rolling to the back of your head\" type of good.  We also got the paella with chicken and seafood, but we didn't really care for it, actually I thought it sucked.  I don't drink much, but I loved my sangria.  Service was great and they didn't try to kick us out, even though we were the last ones there.  I would go again -- just for the patatas aioli!  Definitely a cozy, quiet, dimly lit atmosphere -- nice when you need to catch up on some conversation; you won't have to scream through the loudness of a crowd.\nOn top of what we ordered, friend had 2 glasses of wine and we shared bottled water -- our bill came out to about $75 (w/o tip).", "author": "Jere D."}

The restaurant was very comfortable, cozy, and romantic--I liked all the decorative touches and lighting. The star of our meal was the paella with seafood and chorizo, which was delicious and we'd definitely go back just for that. My husband ordered the rib eye steak which ok, but nothing to write home about. However, we were seriously underwhelmed by the tapas (which is a total bummer b/c I LOVE tapas). We had the shrimp/ham croquettes, the manchego flambeado (manchego cheese w/brandy), and the calamari. I was really disappointed by the taste of the Manchego flambeado--it lacked flavor, and it was drowning in oil which was pretty unappetizing. The calamari was ok, but it came with the same side sauce that the croquettes came with, which was a mayo-based sauce that was pretty flavorless. I'd prefer to have a sauce that has a little more kick to it (and some acid). We had the flan for dessert, which was deliciously smooth and caramely. Service was also slow (our water was refilled maybe once the entire time we wer there). Overall, it was an OK experience with the highlights being the paella and the flan. We probably wouldn't drive all the way to the city just to eat here, but if we happen to be in the neighborhood...", "author": "Christine R."}

We didn't have a reservation so we were nervous about the long wait. We got lucky and was seated fairly quickly. The ambiance at Alegrias is great. Very romantic--making it a great date spot. Food is a bit pricey--but it is worth every penny. The food was simply delicious. We just ordered several tapas: starting out with an assorted imported cheese platter and cured sausage from spain, then had the rabbit stew, roasted spanish, prawns, and pork skewers. We were so stuffed at the end of the meal, it was painful to walk home. This is definitely a MUST-GO.", "author": "Chanli S."}

They have great service, food and romantic settings. Because we had 15 people, they even prepared the set menu for us that saved a lot of time thinking what to order. I had birthday cake delivered directly to the restaurant and the waiter brought it over to us after the dinner.
