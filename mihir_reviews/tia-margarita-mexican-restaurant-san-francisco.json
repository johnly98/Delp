It was my friend's birthday and we were actually going to another place, but it turned out to be closed, so we looked for nearby places and found this one. \nThe place closes at 9pm and it was 8:20pm when we got in. I totally understand that workers wanna go home on time, I've been there, but that's not a reason to be rude with customers... We really didn't feel like they were happy about seeing us. It was quite the opposite, actually. \nSo it was a friend and I and we were expecting another friend to arrive. The hostess came and told us that the kitchen was closing in 5 minutes. Okaaaaaay.... I called my friend who was on his way and took his order through the phone. \nNow, something good about the place (actually worth 5 stars if it wasn't for other details: portions are HUGE. Literally. HUGE! I can't imagine that someone is able to eat all of a complete dinner. That's not  even possible. A friend had the tamales, I had enchiladas rancheras and my other friend had the pollo asado plate. Of course none of us could finish their dish. At 8:50 people were already staring at us like \"get the hell out of here\", but some of the people that were already in when we came in were still there, so what was the point? We ate super quick and asked for the check super quick, since we didn't feel welcome at all. \nWhen we left, there were like 10 people still in there, who were already there when we got in. So whatever. \nIt's also a little pricey for a Mexican restaurant... But the portions are reasonable, so it's okay. \nToo bad the service wasn't nice to us, otherwise it would probably be a 5 stars for me.", "author": "Diana F."}

Sad to say, this time around the food and service weren't good. \n\nI ordered the small combination plate again with a chicken tamale, chile relleno, refried beans and rice all on one big platter. The beans weren't fully cooked and the tamale was bland. The relleno had a little more flavor, but that's not saying much. The best thing I had was the chile con queso appetizer. Melted cheddar cheese with chopped up green chillie's mixed in was heavenly! The cheese was so stringy every time I scooped some up with chips. Check out the photo! \n\nThe service was slow and barely attended our table. We were the only large party and the server took forever to come to our table after we were seated. He wasn't too friendly either. The busser did most of the work by refilling our chips and salsa bowls, refilling our glasses with water, and clearing our plates. I don't think I'll be coming back for awhile.", "author": "Rebecca C."}

It was a LOT of food. Like literally three mails. Honestly, their rice is not like spanish rice. I really didn't like the rice. It kinda seemed like frozen rice and not homemade. Their refried beans were just OK, kinda tasted to me like they just heated up old beans. But, they gave the option of black bean as well, which I appreciated. They were also conscious of our vegetarian diners, and were able to tell us that the rice was made in chicken broth, an important detail that we appreciated. \n\nAll in all, service was slow, took a while, waiter was cool and laid back and got everything right, though.\n\nWe were seated immediately, but took 15 mins before we had waters or menus.\n\nReminiscent of Manuel's Mexican restaurant in Aptos.", "author": "William R."}

We started with margaritas- they were pretty plain, but got the job done ;) They should put more lime juice in them for sure. I got a Tia Tostada with no meat and my boyfriend got enchiladas with shrimp for the filling. I tried a bite and the shrimp had such good flavor- they were rich in garlic, white wine, and butter and the outside enchilada sauce was to die for.

I'm no help.\n\nWhat I can say, is that while they're not re-defining the bounds of Mexican food, you can find a classic Mexican restaurant menu here. You know the kind: enchiladas, burritos, tacos, chiles rellenos; the old reliables. You get a bunch of chips and salsa to your table, and one of them was a bit too hot for me, but it will burn your mouth in the best way. They don't want to be precious or fancy, they just want to be an old school neighborhood spot.\n\nThat's what they are: a neighborhood spot. On a Saturday evening in the neighborhood I noticed a lot of families coming in. Granted, it was early for dinner. Like, embarrassingly early. But they definitely had a full house by 6pm, and it wasn't rowdy, rather neighbors filing in. \n\nIt's simple, they have a really great neon sign out front, and some old school booths as well as a dining area on the non-bar side of the building. the bar is a cool little wrap area, and they were stuffed to the gills with margarita glasses and limes. Even though I'm not a drinker, I can tell they do a serious business of margaritas. They have all the usual suspects on the menu, all the normal Mexican beers, and from the looks of the marg glasses, you can order a bunch and enjoy the night just fine.\n\nI had a chimichanga and it was exactly as you'd expect. But it was well-made, simple, and didn't cost an arm and a leg. \n\nThe comparison to Tommy's is inevitable, so I'll throw in my non-alcoholic two cents: I'd much rather eat here than there. The alco-philes can argue the maragaritas and tequilas all day without my input, but food wise it really was no contest. Neither is really meant to be just about the food, but I'd go here again for the big portions of Mexican food and the hustle of a Richmond neighborhood restaurant setting.", "author": "Jeffrey S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-03-25", "description": "I am disappointed to write this review, but the extremely poor customer service we received this past Friday has lost Tia 4 local customers. \n\nWe came in late Friday (8:30pm) for some drinks and apps (second dinner - a reoccurring Friday night for us) and were seated immediately. We were having a great time - each with top shelf double margaritas and enjoying two app orders. Mid-way through our time there, the waiter asked if we wanted anything else, and we said that we probably won't order more food, but will keep enjoying more drinks. The waiter responded in a pleasant manner (joking with us about going heavy on the drinks), offered to take our menus and left.\n\nRight before getting the check, the host/manager (women with long brown hair) came over to our table to let us know that since we didn't order an entree - she would have to add $6/person to our bill. We've been to Tia multiple times with the same order - so this was new news to us. We politely pushed back, saying we had never heard this rule before - and she stated it's because it's a busy Friday night and she had other guests waiting for 45 minutes to eat dinner with entrees.\n\nOne - there was no line the entire time we were there, so I guess the person waiting for 45 minutes was invisible.\nTwo - there were empty tables in the restaurant so... not sure what's going on here (unless again... person was invisible so they sat without us knowing!)\n\nWe again push back, and she starts to get an attitude after some back and forth. So, in order to avoid a $24 incremental charge, we agree to order one entree. She leaves to get the waiter without a thank you or anything to try to smooth over the obvious negative interaction.\n\nThe waiter comes by with the menu, and we express our dissatisfaction with the situation. He decides to continue the poor customer service by trying to justify this \"entree rule\". When we ask if this rule is in writing anywhere, he points to the bottom of the menu - where it states that there will be a charge applied to the bill for splitting food. He then said \"You split the appetizers - so this applies to you.\"\n\nWHAT? The split charge vs. must order entree are completely different things, but now we're baffled. I'm sorry, we can't share appetizers? Who doesn't share appetizers? We stared at him incredulously, stated how ridiculous that was, but he remained firm.\n\nIn the end, we ordered the cheapest entree at $13. Our total bill pre-entree was already $115 - higher than the table sitting next to us that only ordered two entrees at $15/plate and no drinks. What is the business logic here? Also - if this really is a rule, please tell your customers BEFORE seating them in the dining area or tell them immediately once they've already mentioned mid-way through the meal that there were no more plans to order food.\n\nI don't know what the manager was trying to prove - but from now on, I'm taking my business to local Tommy's Mexican, where we've never been treated so rudely or disrespected like we were at Tia.", "author": "Olivia W."}

Usually I'm a hole in the wall kinda person but I came for the double margs. and conquered all the delicious food.\n\nThis is my friend's go-to for some refreshing top shelf double margaritas (OH BABY). Came on a Sunday in the afternoon after some soccer and a couple of beers. We ordered a round of double margs and the queso appetizer which were perfect. The salsa they bring out is great, the mild is sweet and good for anyone, the spicy is def. a kicker--if you like a little spice, just mix the two, otherwise stick with the milk. Queso was ooey gooey and warm--magic in a dish to start soaking up those beers from earlier!\n\nI ordered the Combination Plate 2 ($15.75) with Rellenos and Enchilada (Beef) and a side of refried beans, which I shared so I could score half of the Carne Asada Quesadillas ($13.75). Everything was great! I didn't think you could beat the whole in the wall comfort food of all the mission places but for what it was, this was really good. My combination plate was perfect, 10/10 would get it again. The Quesadilla was a not my favorite, since the tortilla was like fried super crispy--I think I would've preferred it to be like the super quesadillas you can get on every corner in the mission, and the portion was pretty small for the price but I guess if you weigh in the sides, it's alright. Overall, the rest of the plates seems to go over well anda decent portions once you tap in the sides. \n\nThis stuff hit the spot and I felt better after eating it all--especially with the previous beers, def. soaked up some of that potential drinking aftermath.", "author": "Nerissa C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-07-09", "description": "Update: I'm tempted to give them an extra star as I find this place far more preferable to Tommy's (despite worse hours). If still give them 3 and a half though if I could and I end up rounding down since despite the decent food and great margaritas and salsa, I find them to be rather overpriced. \n\nI'll start by saying the following: if you want the best Mexican food in San Francisco, you should leave the Richmond. If you're like me and live in the neighborhood though, and want a place that is convenient, without the crazy lines of the best places in the Mission, and has great margaritas, Tia Margerita is a good option. \n\nThe comparisons to Tommy's are inevitable since they are fairly close to one another and have similar menus and both are known for their margaritas. I think the margarita at Tia Margarita is far better, and I also enjoyed the chips and salsa here a lot more (I love the mild salsa; the spicy one is way too much for my tastebuds). \n\nThe rest of the food is just okay- it's decent Mexican food, but certainly no where near the best I've had. I would also say the prices on their dinner menu are a bit higher than I would expect and want them to be (for the quality, quantity, and taste of the food). Personally, I would return here mostly for the margaritas (very very good) and the chips and salsa and maybe a shared appetizer or something. They also have a pretty big bar area, along with some tables near the bar and then another dining area with more tables. The atmosphere is enjoyable and the service is always pleasant and quite good. \n\nIf I could, I would give them 3.25-3.5 stars with the extra decimal points mostly for their drinks and the service. Based on everything together though, I would say it's closer to 3 than 4 stars in my opinion.", "author": "Seema U."}

Go here if you want to mingle with 50 somethings looking to get drunk on margaritas and uppity old man bachelors looking to impress a date with overpriced margaritas. Outside of the margaritas, there is nothing memorable or special about this restaurant; for most, it's the closest Mexican restaurant in 6 blocks, and as such it's last man standing. Don't get any illusion that the food at Tia's is beyond average.  Generous portions of bland rice and beans don't make an $18 combo plate any better tasting. \n\nI live in the surrounding neighborhood and walk to Tia's. The bartenders and servers always give attitude and poor service. The tiny restaurant lounge fills when 10 people show up and there is nothing special about the decor. The bill is always a bit puzzling as the bartenders seem to make up the prices and charge whatever they want (4 margaritas = $62?). When they get lazy, they serve margaritas in beer glasses but they always give a smile when they give you attitude. Basically, it's the well known situation that the manager and head bartender has been there 19 years, does whatever he wants, and doesn't care. Two years ago, the restaurant was on the verge of closing because of his attitude and today it's popular because the 50 somethings think margaritas are cool again. In 2 years it will cycle back.\n\nSkip the noise and go to Tommy's on Geary with amazing margaritas, a super long list of tequilas and 10 times better service. Tommy's is where the locals in the Richmond go. The margaritas are better, the food is much better and the family owned business atmosphere is fun. \n\n\n\nFood = mediocre.\nMaragaritas = good\nService = poor\nPrice = poor.", "author": "Jay T."}

I called to place the order when he picked me up downtown. The order was ready about 10 minutes after we arrive.\n\n*Chips and Salsas\nIf we ate here, they would have given us chips and salsa, so I'm happy they were nice enough to pack some. There's two different salsa. One is spicy and packs a kick! My mouth actually felt like it was on fire towards the end of our meal. I wasn't expecting that. Mixing the two makes for a good balance.\n\nAll orders are served with rice, salad and your choice of refried or black beans (we got refried beans with everything):\n\n*Chef's special combo ($22.75): One third each - Carne asada, Pollo asada, Gambas\nThis was my order. The shrimp were garlicky and buttery. The chicken had a good char and flavor. The steak was slightly tough, but still good. You can ask for corn or flour tortillas with this plate.\n\n*Enchiladas (2) $13.75: corn tortillas rolled around shredded beef and covered with a mild red chili sauce and melted jack cheese\nThe roommate's. He didn't like this as the sauce was way too thick. Had the consistency of a lighter peanut butter which just tasted weird.\n\n*Chimichanga (1) $13.25: crisp large flour tortilla rolled around chicken and rice with guacamole (no sour cream)\nIt's kind of bland with just the rice and chicken filling. Super oily as well.\n\nI'd say the food deserves about 3 stars, but the server taking care of me was super nice!

For me, being part Latino, it's something I've come to expect when I go eat Mexican food. That being said, the dining experience wasn't horrible.\n\nThe servers were friendly and attentive, and the portions are quite generous. I shared the chef's special combo, which comes with beef, chicken, and shrimp with rice and beans. The rice isn't you're typical \"spanish rice\" and they only offer black beans or re-fried beans (I'm a pinto/whole bean kind of guy). I will say that the shrimp was SPECTACULAR, but that was the only thing that really stood out to me from meal.\n\nAll in all, if you're of latino decent/upbringing, you're probably not going to be a huge fan of this place.

This has nothing to do with the food or staff. \n\nThis restaurant now imposes a 2 credit card limit for their dining tables. Really? I've been coming here for years. If I sit at the bar with 2 friends - no problem.  We can each legitimately pay for our drinks and meal. But, at a table with my 2 best friends? Sorry. Two people only get to pay. I'm so mortified for having to ask the wait staff for an exception, or ask one of my friends to buy my dinner. We are all three professionals. We work hard and choose to spend our money at that this local restaurant. \n\nI've witnessed this restaurant being very accommodating to families. Children running around the restaurant...I've even seen a parent changing a dirty diaper at the table. Gross. Have I ever complained? Nope. Love this vibe of this neighborhood place. But, I'm now getting shamed because I'm not a couple or a family? I'm not respected as a valuable customer? I'm not getting the basic standard of service in San Francisco? Nearly every restaurant accommodates this common payment method. \n\nI hate getting upset at a family business. I tried to give my feedback to the manager/owner tonight, but she could not even respect me enough to look me in the eye. Instead, she sat in her desk/box, and processed credit cards while I attempted to explain my dissatisfaction. It was supremely disappointing. I ended up waking away. \n\nI feel strongly about calmly and authentically voicing my opinions about my experience to a business representative, and expect to be heard. If not, then it is my obligation to respond by simply withdrawing my business. So, perhaps that is the next step. Is this really what they want? Do they care about their regular customers? I'm leaving this an open question for now. \n\nI hope there is some acknowledgment and change in this policy. I have been an advocate for this business, and would prefer to continue to do so. But, beware to any customers that are with more than one friend - bring cash, or get ready to ask for somebody in your group to pay your bill. Silly. Outdated. Unfriendly.

A group of 7 of us went out to celebrate a friends graduation and this place was recommended for their well raved about margaritas and large combination plates. We waited about 30 minutes for a table and ordered several drinks at the bar. Once we were seated, we were greeted with Salsa and chips -- very tasty. It was when our server was informed that not everyone would be eating was when our experience took a dive for the worst. He immediately snapped and asked us if our party had informed the host that not everyone would be ordering an entree. I've been in the restaurant business for many years and was absolutely appalled when he started giving us a major attitude for this. There was at least $60 of alcohol at the table and 4 of the 7 of us ordered food. I still can't see the issue. They took our chips away as if we came there to camp on waters and free salsa. They not once came over to refill waters and pointed at us and laughed at us. It was the epitome of a bizarre experience and  when a member from our party addressed the manager she finally came over and slammed 2 waters on the table and snickered! The worst part, they added extra charges to our bill, like $6 split charges and drinks we didn't order. They also \"accidentally\" charged our card $9 extra for no reason! Avoid this place at all costs, it was a nightmare and the customer service was unlike anything I've ever witnessed. This place deserves nobody's business for the way they treat people!

We walked in around 8:30pm on a Friday and it was busy as usual! The hostess said 30 minute wait, totally understandable. So we ordered drinks at the bar with Francisco before our table was ready. The hostess really stepped up her game (or the people ahead of us walked out) because a table was freed up in the bar after about 10 minutes.\n\nI had gallbladder surgery recently and was worried if I'd be able to find anything to stomach on the menu. I ordered the \"light eater\" plate - MUCH smaller than those huge combo plates - one chicken enchilada with red sauce (no cheese or sour cream) which came with black beans, rice, and salad. It was the perfect portion and didn't make me sick! Yay! I also had to watch myself with their tasty chips and salsa; very easy to go overboard with those. Everything tasted fresh and flavorful. \n\nMy boyfriend, card-carrying member of the clean plate club, wolfed down his carne asada enchilada combo plate in no time. My friend really enjoyed her shredded beef chimichanga combo plate too. Full bellies and content tastebuds all around.", "author": "Liz G."}

Luckily, we managed to snatch a parking space directly across the street from the restaurant as someone was leaving.  Don't expect to be this lucky though.  I'm told, however, that apparently there's a free parking lot on 18th avenue that you can park in (not sure exactly where though).\n* Portions are enormous and prices are reasonable for what you get.\n* You will be brought chips and salsa (one mild and one spicy) before your main dish.\n\nThe only other negative I can think of aside from the loudness and the parking situation, is the fact that it took a while for the bill to arrive.

The condescending hostess and rude waitress should have been a red flag to just turn around and walk out.\n\nLet's set the scene.  I was excited for our fiesta date night so I was in a very good mood.  It was a Friday at 8pm and we walked up to the hostess table.  She was chatting with a customer so we waited politely for her to finish her conversation.  \"2 people,\" we said.  She nodded and continued her conversation.  \"Could we sit here?\" we asked, pointing to an open table right next to us. \"HAHAHAHA! No!\" she exclaimed.  I asked the customer in front of me if I had said something funny because he had laughed too, and he replied, \"Oh, because it's probably reserved.\"  I looked at the table, it wasn't.  \n\nI decided to let it slide, it was Friday, I should chill.  The hostess led us to our table and the waitress handed us our menus.  \"What would you like to drink?\" she asked, as I sat down.  \"Hm, water for now\", I said, as I opened the menu.  \"You don't want anything from the bar?!\" she demanded.  My boyfriend had to reply 'No' for me because I was so shocked I couldn't respond.  My face looked like this : =O.  \"I haven't opened the menu, so I don't know what I'd like to order from the bar\", I replied back.  \n\nWe ordered our food shortly after and were promptly brought chips and two kinds of salsa.  After 20 minutes of waiting and eating chips, we waved down the waitress to ask for a drink menu.  She refused to give me a drink menu.  \"What do you want?\" she scoffed, \"We're a bar, we have what's at a bar! Beer, margaritas!\"  I just about had it.  I literally bit my tongue.  \"Well\", I explained, \"he would like a beer, and he doesn't know what beer you have here.\"  She rattled off the different beers for him to select from and then recited what kind of margaritas were available.  We ordered.\n\nWith every tick of the clock, we were leaning more and more towards leaving and asking for our food to go.

I was wrong. When my friend and I walked into the restaurant we were stared at for 20 seconds by the bartender and the waitress. After about 30 seconds of awkwardness in a non crowded room, \"Are you here for dinner?\" we were finally asked by the waitress. We decided to sit outside, which was nice on a warm day. \n\nI asked right off about the margaritas and was told, \"We have strawberry and regular margaritas. We have well and top shelf on our menu and just so you know we will be serving them in plastic cups because you guys are sitting outside.\"\n\nNo problem I thought. Well margaritas can't be more than 4-5 dollars each. I was wrong about that also. \n\nFirst of all no one lets you know that the portions are HUGE. They can easily feed two hungry people and I'm really glad we shared a plate considering it was $15 and there were no options of anything cheaper. We were given two dirty plates of our own which we sent back after having to yell \"EXCUSE ME\" since we were barely checked on by a waitress who didn't even know what types of enchiladas were available. We were given one clean plate and another dirty plate. Come on....\n\nThe food was so-so. I wouldn't consider it authentic Mexican. The rice had cold spots and the sauces weren't even flavorful at all.\n\nWhen we got the bill we see that the margaritas are 9$ each. \"Oh they are double shot margaritas for Cinco De Mayo...\" says the waitress after not letting us know when we originally asked. If you have a special that day you need to let the customers know when they sit down! \n\nI told her I wasn't paying for it and she made the drinks 6 dollars each which was nice but I was still frustrated. I came to find out the woman who seated us was the OWNER!? Wow. Not even the owner could inform us of the specials for Cinco De Mayo in an unpacked restaurant. \n\nI have no idea if this place is usually good on a non-holiday but I was extremely disappointed. I would have rather grabbed some grub at the taqueria around the corner on Geary and made my own margaritas at home.", "author": "Ashley M."}

The one with the vinyl booths, cheesy mexican music, unlimited chips and salsa, and not-great-but-good-enough-tex-mex?  Well Tia Margarita is pretty much that place, but in San Francisco.  Yes, they don't have queso, and yes the food here won't hold a candle to good tex-mex from Texas, but everything here is good enough and close enough to what you're homesick for to scratch that tex-mex itch.  The margaritas are pretty damned good (and strong), the spicy salsa is actually spicy, and the menu features things like fajitas, chimichangas, and ranchero sauce enchiladas.

I didn't expect much stopping in here during a bike ride considering it was in the Richmond, but we figured we would try it. The margaritas are strong, but not good. I got a chile relleno/taco combo. The relleno was not bad, it seemed fresh which is hard to come by since usually when I order one somewhere it's obviously been prepared ahead of time and microwaved. I would have liked it a lot more if it had Mexican cheese in it instead of jack. Chicken taco was fine. The rice is pretty terrible. It tastes like rice-a-roni or some other premade rice brand.

This was my first time at Tia Margaritas. So I decided to read some Yelp reviews and check out some photos. A lot of people complained about how they got charged for a double margarita, when they in fact ordered a single. Well, well! It happened to me too as well. My partner and I both ordered single margaritas and the server repeated our order. But when we get the check, we got charged for doubles! And we complain but get scolded that we were wrong?! Wow really?!  And they did not edit the check whatsoever. Anyways, just had to share. The food is fine, you can definitely share a plate with another person. I'm not sure if I will be back and I am a local from the neighborhood who loves to support local businesses. Thanks for the shade Tia margaritas, not cool at all. You don't scold customers like that.

My brother lives about 100 footsteps away from here and while visiting him, I thought I'd make a stop because of all the amazing things I've heard and how amazing their food looks in pictures. My mom and I walked in as soon as they opened on a Thursday afternoon at 4pm. Which by the way their hours are kind of odd and I have no idea why it's set up that way but it has always been very inconvenient. Nonetheless, we were seated right away, our server came to us with our menus, we ordered our beverages, and we didn't want to grub to the max so we wanted to share a plate. We told the server we wanted to share the large combo plate which gave you three items. He immediately stopped me and said there is a $6 charge for splitting a plate which really shocked me. I have NEVER EVER in my entire dining history even at some of the most top notch places in Los Angeles, heard that there is any charge for wanting to share a meal. I told him that was probably the most ridiculous thing I've heard and he was understanding and said that he wanted to let us know before we ordered that way just so we are aware which I'm glad he did. Especially after seeing so many reviews about how they add extra charges on to people's bills. Anyways, we asked him what if we wanted to split an appetizer? He said that's fine, there is no extra charge for that. I just felt like, they shouldn't be the ones deciding how much money we should spend or how much food we should be eating. We just ordered the quesadillas, which were really yummy and their salsas are really delicious as well. I just don't know that I would care to come back, or at least not when they JUST open because it's pretty clear by the attitude and vibe of the whole place that they hate being there, maybe until it gets busy but, I'm a fan of Mexican food so I'm pretty sure I can find another place anywhere else that won't decide how to eat my meal or spend my money.", "author": "Sapna G."}

After reading what other yelpers had to say, I decided to give this place a try.   One of the reviewer's makes indicates lack of attention to incoming patrons.  There was no host/hostess podium at the entrance.  I waited for a couple of minutes before communicating to the bartender that I'd like of be seated for dinner.  He pointed to a podium situated at the other end of the room.  There was no on standing there.  I made my way there, and was eventually seated by the hostess.\n\nThe ambiance is very dark, and did nothing for me.  I ordered the combination plate with a chicken enchilada, chili relleno, and a beef taco.  The food was served hot, however for me there could have been more chicken in the enchilada, more beef in the taco, and more cheese in the chili relleno.  Furthermore, the relleno was mostly batter.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-08-14", "description": "Well, I can't say I'm not super disappointed. We walked by this place months ago and peeked our head in to see what it was like. It looked like a solid, bustling neighborhood spot that we were excited to try at some point. Since we moved to the neighborhood recently, we were excited at having the prospect of a cute mexican place, cause there's certainly enough Sushi and Thai food to choose from.\n\nWe wanted to sit at the bar. It was full, so we were planing to sit at a table. I've worked in this industry for 10 years in high end restaurants in this city so I know what awful service looks like. This is absolutely what we got, and it only unravelled from when we walked in the door.\n\nNO ONE acknowledged we were there. Since there wasn't a sign that said \"Seat Yourself\" we weren't about to. I fucking hate it when people do. We stood at the front door for at least a few minutes, but long enough to wonder if there was a separate entrance and we came in the wrong way. Tired of waiting for a host that obviously wasn't coming or not working I started to get a waitpersons attention.\n\nWhen I asked him if there was a host, he pointed to a young lady chatting up one of the tables, who then looked over at us and then continued talking to the table. Whatever. Not a big deal. Take care of your guests, I get it. The waiter was extremely polite and sat us immediately at a table and promptly took drink orders. Ok. Cool. I don't like walking into a restaurant and figuring out for myself how to get seated for five minutes, but things are looking up.\n\nDrinks come, he's in the middle of taking our order when another table is leaving and they engage in conversation, while we're sitting there in the middle of ordering. I'll also mention that the host hasn't left that table she was at upon our arrival and it's now been easily 15 minutes. Waiter is finally available to finish taking our order. He's a nice guy, but I'm already realizing people aren't coming for the service, so it must be the food and the super strong margaritas,.\n\nAt the average price of $18 a plate I was skeptical. When the food arrived the portions were HUGE, but it doesn't matter how large portion sizes are when the food tastes nowhere close to authentic. Colibri and or Tres Agaves can get away with charging these prices, but definitely not this place. Did I mention that the host is now sitting at the table she was chatting up, because standing was getting too tiresome at that point for her?\n\nAs we sat there, we were both bummed. Bad food, bad service, waiter was nice, but I mean the host? Give me a fucking break. Your job is to greet people upon arrival. Not pay extra attention to people you obviously know. THE BEST PART: THE TABLE NEXT TO US GETTING ALL THE SPECIAL ATTENTION WERE THE OWNERS!!! So while everything else is going to shit in terms of guest experience, at least the owners need for nothing.\n\nWe were there an hour and a half too long. Finally the host got up and did her job, and the owner went to the credit card machine to help, I guess. The owner dropped our check off after receiving payment and didn't look us in the eye to thank us or thank me by my last name (not a big deal, but at least make eye contact when you thank someone). I realized she didn't have time to do either of those things cause she was too worried about saying goodbye to some drunk regulars.\n\nMust be nice to feel special in the biggest shithole in the Richmond.", "author": "Alexis K."}

I had purchased some half off dinner vouchers for Tia Margarita online months ago and completely forgot about them.  Since the vouchers expired yesterday, I went with a friend to try the place out. Each voucher was good for 2 small (not small by any means) combo dishes and 2 margaritas.  We could only use one of the vouchers last night.  The Manager, Jennifer, kindly extended the second voucher it so that I could either come back or give it to someone else to enjoy.  \n\nThis place was great!  A pleasant find; I will recommend and return to with family and friends. We were greeted right away and provided a table.  Chips and 2 types of salsa were brought to our table. Showed our friendly server our vouchers and he told us what was included.  Made us feel very welcomed.  Portion sizes are very generous...plenty for lunch left over's.  The small combo dish came with two main dish choices, black beans, rice and green salad.  The rice and beans were full of flavor as was the entire dish (Shredded Beef Burrito and a Chile Relleno).  The Margaritas are as original as you can get.  Our meals came with a Double Top Shelf Margaritas; a few sips of that and you are on cloud 9!  :)  A little too strong at first but as the ice melted, it was fine and fully enjoyed!  \n\nThe horseshoe shaped bar is very inviting.

Having the bar at the front was a bit confusing, not to mention it reminded me of the Marina (ew, I feel dirty all of a sudden...). The hostess was nice, but she blended right in with the crowd at the bar! We were seated in the back in a very dimly lit room. I have terrific vision according to my eye check up, but I had a difficult time reading the menu. Finally, about half an hour later, the hostess turned the lights on to a brighter setting.\n\nOh yeah, half an hour after I sat down, I still had my menu. Well, at least I could read it now. Our waitress was an old lady who was moving very slowly. I commend her for still working at her age, but man... sometimes you just gotta know when to hang it up. At a busy, fast-paced restaurant, you need to be quick, not hard of hearing, and not forgetful. Let's face it... you have to be young. I'm not trying to sound harsh, but it's the truth. I know, she probably needs to work, etc. etc. etc. Fine. I'm not against old people working... just find another job, not waitressing at a busy restaurant.\n\nAnyway, needless to say, she was really slow, we had to repeat our orders at least five times, and she continuously forgot to get us drinks. We got our chips right away from the bus boy, but never received any water. The bus boy was friendly and fast. We ended up just asking him for a lot of things. Perhaps the waitress thought it was beneath her to bring us water. It is, after all, a bus boy's job.\n\nOnto the food... it was average. This is as whitewashed of a Mexican restaurant as it gets. The only thing I remember was my flauta, which was very crispy, the way they should be.

Its like they went to some \"bizaro\" parallel universe rather than the place I know.  \n\nEvery time I walk into this place it has the same familiar customers; consistent and tasty margaritas; and decent food dishes.  And I sit at the bar when I come, which is not often, but when I'm there everything is consistently good.  Each margarita is prepared with tequila, triple sec, and at least two whole limes - because I watch them make these drinks.\n\nThe salsa of late comes in a spicy red, or a red with a bit of garlic.  They appear fresh and I am a lover of good salsas, and they definitely are consistent there as well.  The rice - now I imagine they are either cooked with one of two spices to add the coloring and flavor - turmeric or saffron.  \n\nOne of the things that cracks me up the most with reviews is how people take on a restaurant review on one of the busiest days and expect that to be typical.  The hyperbole in these two reviews had me laughing.\n\nThe drinks are good and strong - what's not to like.  If its TOO STRONG, then only drink one and let the ice melt.  No one likes overly salty food or the wrong dishes to be sure although  I've never had the wrong food served to me here.  But again, if you pick the busiest day in a restaurant's year, please be smart and cut the restaurant some slack.  Go back and try it on a day when the staff isn't slammed.  Its only fair.\n\nAnd on a note about their margaritas - on the rocks - and much better than Tommy's IMHO.  I don't know what tequila they use, but the end product is way better than most restaurants.  I find Tommy's way too tart.

I mean jeez have a little bit of patience and compassion.   \n\nI feel like this is kinda like saying \"they had great water!\" but their quesadillas are off the hook!!!  I usually scoff at corn tortillas, but they are what MAKE the quesadillas here.  I have never ordered the one with meat, because the cheesy oozy buttery one gives me lady wood every time.  The thing is though, you gotta eat it FAST because it's only \"last meal\" worthy if you eat it right when they place it on the table...honestly if you could snatch a piece while the waitress/er is placing it on your table that's the sweet spot.  \n\nPer some Yelp recommendations I got the Sampler this time - THANKS GUYS, it was the best idea ever.  Everything on it was deep-fried except for maybe the quesadilla and the burritos, and I didn't even have to choose between chicken or beef because I was brought 2 of each in the form of spinach and tomato tortillas, and when I dropped my taquito in my margarita on accident, I was brought 2 new taquitos (cause 1 on a plate would be lonely) AND a new margarita!", "author": "Megan A."}

I went on a Friday night and mind you it's a really busy night but it took us an hour to get our food with no updates from our waiter. Our waiter was MIA and I constantly had to hound whoever was around to ask to refill our drinks. When we finally got our food it was mediocre to say the least. I ordered the enchiladas and the sauce was so terrible it tasted like bland tomato and had no flavor to it. If I had to rate this restaurant solely based on food I would give it 2 stars but the reason why I'm giving this establishment one star is because I'm so disappointed by the service. \n\nMy guest had strict religious practices where they are unable to consume beef. Half-way through eating their 'chicken dish' my guest noticed that there were chunks of beef in the 'chicken' dish. We immediately asked to speak to a manager and when my guest stated that they were highly offended by the beef in their dish due to religious practices, the manager rudely said 'that's chicken, there's no beef.' I had to pull out the chunks of beef and put them on the side of the plate to show her that there was in fact beef in the dish. And even still, she questioned the fact that it was beef. SO RUDE. The manager's questioning of our rightful accusation was rude and not customer service-oriented at all. Instead of addressing the offensive nature of what had just occurred, she repeatedly insisted we order something else.

Stick to the basic Mexican staples like tamales, burritos and enchiladas which are very good. The empanadas are terrible, the taquitos, carne asada and rice are very average. The fajitas are very good but you only get maybe 3 oz. of steak.\n\nSummary:\n-----------------\nI give it 4 overall stars: 5 stars for the margaritas, 5 for the bar staff service/attitude but 3 1/2 stars average for food (some great, some meh). I also give it 2 stars for waitress service/attitude (the old lady is the worst) and 3 for the business hours (they close at 10:30 Fridays!). Did I mention the margis rule???\n\n\nFull Review:\n-------------------\nI have eaten here a few times and was disappointed with the Mexican food the first few times, having grown up in San Diego and been weaned on the best. After 12 years in SF I know there is much better Mexican restaurants around (La Barca and Tortilla Heights are two great ones) and even many better taquerias (La Taqueria and Nick's are epic). But the basic staples I have discovered to be very good. What has always kept me coming back (probably 15 times now) is the ultra friendly bartender (manager?) Francisco and his truly authentic margaritas. \n\nThe margaritas here are made using only good quality silver tequila, cointreau triple sec and fresh lime juice (so no sugary mix). I rarely drink margaritas because those made with the sweet and sour mix give me brutal heart burn but I have no problem taking down a few authentic margaritas and quite enjoy those served here. Just one of the jumbo margis will smack you in the face and two will make you delightfully toasted and much smarter, funnier and better looking. \n\nThe other cool thing about the place is that most of the patrons (like myself) are locals from the Richmond/Seacliff neighborhoods so on a Friday night you see lots of familiar faces. \n\nThe only other bummer is the place has limited hours (they close at 10:30 Friday and they do not open on weekends until 4PM!). WTF? Anyways, if you go for the margis and basic Mexican staples. Also, definitely sit at the bar as Francisco (the more outgoing, mexi-beach bum bartender) is much friendlier and efficient than the wait staff I have experienced.", "author": "Mike L."}

So they had to ask him when he came by to pick up another order.\n\nThe food took a long time to come and although they said the plates were hot they were not.  I ordered enchiladas rancheros without beans so I can't comment on those.  The rice tasted and looked  like plain white rice with fake butter.  There was no Mexican seasoning to it at all.  The salad was huge, just shredded lettuce with tasteless salsa.  Huge portions of rice and salad compared to the size of the enchiladas.  The cheese on top of the enchiladas was melted but the inside cheese was not.  The onions and peppers on top of the enchiladas were huge chunks, a little dicing might have helped.\n\nNo one ever came and refilled the water, I had to ask for more water and it took a while for him to bring more.  We had to ask the waiter for the check after our plates had been cleared for at least 15 minutes.  Then he never came back to take the credit card, after another 15 minutes I went looking for him in the hallway where they were coming out with the food.  I couldn't find him so I just gave it to another waiter, the hostess ended up bringing it back to us.\n\nOur waiter spent quite a bit of time laughing and visiting with two others parties in our room, but I guess since we were not regulars he no time for us.\n\nI will not be back.\n\nI guess if you like their margarites have some at the bar.", "author": "Madeline M."}

I've been with friends, family, co-workers, everyone loves this place.  First thing you need to know is that the food is TASTY!  We've probably gone thru everything on the menu at this point and have never been disappointed.   It's one of our favorite places to eat in the city.\n\nThe portions are HUGE!  My wife and I will go and split a large combination plate (which gives you a choice of 3 items - tamale, burrito, enchilada, chile relleno, etc.).  It's perfect because you can try a bunch of stuff and it's only around $15.  Not only have we both been full off of that plate, but we can still bring leftovers home for another meal.  Rockin'!  \n\nMy buddy ordered a small combination plate and that came with TWO burritos!  Nice.  I read where some people were bitching about the prices, but, the food you get will feed an army.\n\nNext, the Margaritas are great.  We had a group of 5 there tonight and everyone commented on how tasty they were.  I read a few reviews where people felt they were watered down, but I've never thought that once in all the Margaritas I've had there over the years.  In fact, sometimes I thought they were TOO strong.  (I mean, it can't really ever be TOO strong, but, ya know what I mean). \n\nThe wait staff there is great.  We had chips and salsa on our table within moments of being seated.  They're quick to fill back up your water, they're generous with the chips and salsa and constantly come around to make sure you have everything you need.  After years of going, I finally introduced myself to the same waitress who has waited on us so many times.  Her name is Rosa and she's awesome.  She's got a great sense of humor and we love joking around with her.  I already can't wait to go back....", "author": "dave g."}

You couldn't comprehend that I wanted 2 waters to start because my cohort was away from the table when I ordered drinks. You got my order wrong, but I didn't say anything because it looked delicious and you were old. As the night went on, you kept running into my chair as you hobbled past the table. Never once did we get refills on our water (but you did finally comprehend why I wanted two glasses of water....) \n\nWhen you brought us the bill, you came back thirty seconds later and muttered the word \"Collect?\" WHO ARE YOU, A BILL COLLECTOR? You then proceeded to whisper in my ear \"We have people waiting for your table.\" Okay, I get it. You're busy and need my table. We're collecting our money. Calm down.\n\nYou then took our check. It had money in it. But no tip. Typically, I'm very generous toward those working in the service industry. I too work in the service industry and understand that their jobs suck. Well, unfortunately for you, we didn't feel you were deserving of one. But what did you do after that? You ASKED US WHY YOU DIDN'T GET A TIP. It was the most awkward experience of my short life. You even dug around on the table top looking for cash while we were standing there getting our jackets on.

The kitchen is closed.\" No apologies, just flat out denial. \n\n\"If at first you don't succeed, dust yourself off and try again.\" Right? Right. So now I'm back and this time we arrived earlier and were seated right away. We sat in the back of the restaurant which was quite disappointing because the room was too dark. I struggled to read the menu and enjoy the food since our table was only lit by a tiny candle. One star down.\n\nWhen it came to the food, the chips and salsa were a-ok. The salsa tasted like a fusion of canned tomatoes and ketchup, which I can assure you is not a good combination. Two stars down. However, the green salsa was good and extra spicy. The chips were super crunchy and highly addictive. \n\nFor starters, we had the chicharrones and I felt it was overpowered with cumin. It was crispy but too salty. The gambas al ajillo (shrimp with garlic and butter sauce) was good but nothing special. It's paired with flour tortillas and that made it fun to eat. \n\nOn to the main courses. We had enchiladas, tamales, tacos, and flautas. What a disappointment. The dishes were bland and tasteless. We had to add salt to every single serving and that is a no, no in my book.  Although the portions are big, it did not make up for the mediorce options on the menu. Three stars down.\n\nAs for service, our waitress was very sweet and attentive. She always made sure we had our refills on drinks, tortillas, and chips and salsa. We didn't try their margaritas but overheard from the two tables next to us that they were \"pretty damn strong.\" Too bad I won't be coming back to give you an updated review on that.\n\nI should of known that it wasn't meant for me to try the food here when we were already denied the first time around.

I don't remember her name but she so sweet and hilarious.\n\nIt was very busy and as I looked around and observed the crowd I noticed it was a mix of older folks, families and young people in business casual attire.

Did some secret council convene and decide to torture us by making our favorite comfort food unavailable on the hardest day of the week? This includes Tia Margaritas, Celia's, and Tommy's!

This was a bad idea. \n\nAfter a long day of wild boar hunting with my dad we decided to quell our starving bellies at Tia's. We step into the restaurant, and surprisingly, it is not at all crowded on a Saturday night (bad sign). Nobody helps to seat us at first, but finally the bartender tells us to take any table. \n\nA sweet, yet awkward Irish waitress (love the accent) brought us menus. However, we then waited 20 minutes to get water and to order. This annoyance was tempered by the moderately good chips and salsa that a busser brought us. The chips were good, seemed fresh, but a little thick for my taste. The spicy salsa (they also have a non-spicy) was quite good, but didn't change the overall experience. \n\nI ordered the chicken enchiladas and my father ordered the burrito and chili relleno combo. All were bland and uninspired. As we worked through our food with sadness and dismay, a crowd of Irish folk developed all around. This was probably the highlight of the meal listening to them sing and drink loudly. Always a good time. Although, it was quite an odd sight seeing Irish people crowd up a mexican food restaurant. \n\nOverall, I will probably never go back to Tia's.

It looks like a house, doesn't have loud mariachi music blaring from inside, and doesn't blast the streets with lights. \n\nI walked in here with a friend after passing by numerous times. We ordered the appetizer combo and a Margarita. While we waited, we sipped on our drinks and ate some chips. They offered two salsas, a mango fruit flavored one and a spicy one. Both were good, but I preferred the fruit flavored one. You can also combine them for the best of both worlds.\n\nWhen our food arrived, It turned out a lot better than I expected. We received small burritos, a quesadilla, empanadas, and a few other assortments that I forget. Good sizes, easily shared, and good quality. It wasn't the most authentic Mexican I've ever eaten, but for Americanized Mexican, it was pretty darn good -- a LOT better than Chevy's or any of the other chains. \n\nI left happy and decided I'd go back with more friends. The second time I went, we sat at the bar. I'll admit, I don't remember much. The bartender was nice, the drinks were generous, and the food didn't end up on the street, if you know what I mean.\n\nUpdate (4/5/08) - I went back and it was a mad house. The waiters forgot our orders,  bartenders ignored us, and it was not quite the same experience. The margaritas were actually pretty bad?

If you do find yourself sitting down for south-of-the-border fare, it's probably upscale Peruvian or down-home Salvadoran or some such.  Maybe Mexi-joints have been deemed too suburban?  Granted, if your menu is limited to burritos, enchiladas and fajitas, with obligatory sides of rice and beans, then you're about as Mexican as Panda Express is Chinese.  If only some bold chef would see this as a challenge and open a place specializing in authentic Mexi-dishes (perhaps even limit it to a specific region), I'm confident our pretentious citizenry would eat it up.\n\nBut in the meantime, Mrs M likes her enchiladas, and I like my free bottomless chips and salsa, so I figured we'd give this a shot.  Food was good but unmemorable--except that they gave us butter with the tortillas!  I was baffled, but Wes M never turns down free fat (seriously, I brought home some Tennessee bacon grease in a ziploc bag from the presidential debate party I went to--long story).\n\nThe other problem is that, for a restaurant that has \"Margarita\" in the name and a $9+ \"double\" margarita on the menu, it turned out to be disappointingly small, and I think Maria is right that they're pretty weak too (tasty though).  \n\nSo in the end, Velvet Cantina remains the undisputed king of the limited competition in this category.

Service is for those who enjoy watching a four-year-old tie his shoe.\n\n\nAside from the hostess practically leaving us in the dust to show us our table, our next first impression was our server asking us for our beverage order, then walking off before we could say anything...the fuck?\n\nHe got a margarita, I got a coke. The margarita was your basic margarita, nothing special. The coke was basically soda water with a splash of syrup. I didn't even know you could screw coca-cola up.\n\nThe chips were too thick for my taste, and the salsa basically reminded me of Pace Picante. \n\nAfter finishing my water with a splash of coke and my actual water, I watched our server pass our table four times before we had to ask a busser for a refill. (Apparently, they also don't do refills on soda, even though their soda comes from the bar, at the well. Cheapskates.) After finally getting her attention, she leaves our table, and elbow checks my boyfriend in the shoulder. We gave her the benefit of the doubt, that she's old and fat and maybe just lost her balance. There's no way she did that on purpose, right? I mean, seriously, right?\n\nThe ONLY redeeming quality to the food was that everything was stuffed to the max...his relleno, his taco, my tamale and my enchilada. I fear though that what they splurge on meats, they cut cost in spices-everything was BLAND. Also, the refried beans were sweet (fucking WEIRD), and I'm pretty sure they were using Uncle Ben's rice.\n\nAfter we watched her screw up the next table's order, we tried asking for our check, eager to leave the stagnant memory of this shithole behind us as soon as possible. Our server motioned to us that she was going to take someone else's order first, then check us out. You bitch.\n\nSensing our annoyance, she cut them off in the middle of their order to tally our tab, then, when my boyfriend quickly handed her his card, she had the gall to say, \"You sure? I mean, I'm human, I make mistakes.\" Gee, really?\n\nAfter contemplating what sort of paltry amount we should leave her for a tip (if anything at all), the hostess comes over, shoves his card back in his face, and goes, \"We need a new one.\" Uh, no bitch, what you need is a new fucking attitude.\n\nWe left that old lady no tip. If she is in fact the owner, she should put her happy ass back in the office, because as a server, she fucking blows.\n\nI will not be returning to this pathetic excuse for traditional Mexican fare, and I will most definitely be referring people to other places.\n\nI have never been disappointed by Mexican food (unless I go to Chevy's), but I guess there's a first for everything. \n\nBottom line: This place is absolutely mediocre, and the only reason people continue to go back is because the only other option for our neighborhood is Tommy's.", "author": "Sachi T."}

My quesadilla was not a huge slab of oily cheese between a limp tortilla, but crispy and melty with really flavorful salsa and guacamole. It came with a salad, rice, and beans. The serving size was just right... this was not a situation of size over quality. However, I saw some other patrons with enormous plates, so I must've chosen from the light-eater's section of the menu, then. They'll keep refilling your chips and salsa, which are actually freshly made.\n\nThe margaritas are pretty damn delicious... top shelf, blended... MMMMMGOOD! I don't think I'd get more than one or two drinks per visit, though, or I'd end up broke for the night. Margaritas are sold by the glass (no pitchers) and are about $7 for a single shot and  $10 for a double.\n\nI like this place better than Puerto Allegre. It was busy, but there was plenty of seating and you didn't have to hunt down a waitstaff to take an order.

So naturally I was thrilled to get a taco/enchilada combination with a whole lotta beans and rice on quite possibly the largest plate I've ever eaten on in my life.

The enchilada was pretty good if the taco was somewhat lackluster, and D was happy with his scrambled eggs with chorizo.\n\nI had one of their fabled margaritas which I think in multiples would be  happy drunkies in a glass, and the salsa was worthwhile as well: the mild version, if a little too mild for my taste, was still quite good, and I liked that you could taste the flavor of the peppers themselves in the spicy salsa.  It's quite comfy inside Tia Margarita, and as I was trying to figure out what exactly the vibe was, D stopped grazing and pronounced solemnly, \"it's like we're not in San Francisco.\"  Which I don't think was a slam against Tia Margarita or SF - it was a place where we could relax and shovel some good eats into our hungry mouths.", "author": "Tanya N."}

We left after it was apparent that we had become invisible to her; all within the span of about four minutes.

We opted for this over the better reviewed Tommy's due to the fact that Tia's actually lists their prices online (who doesn't do that?).\n\nIn terms of this place it was... okay. It tends to favor quantity over quality, which might appeal to someone that is super hungry... but we tend to prefer it in reverse order. The portions here are very big though, especially for the price. A single entry was more than enough to keep this couple filled, while the chips and salsa kept coming before hand (without us having to ask for it, which was a plus).\n\nThe downside was the food itself. To be fair, the female component of this review team is very tough when it comes to Mexican food (a byproduct of a parent who cooks yummy Mexican dishes), so lacking food of the Mexican variety tends to be less tolerated. On the night we went, we ordered the large platter with three different options so as best to sample everything. We got the burrito, the relleno, and the enchilada. The burrito was... okay. The chicken inside wasn't great. but it was huge with a lot of spices. The Relleno was a little lacking though. We tend to associate rellenos as being very flavorful, and this in all honesty was one of the duller tasting ones we have had. The weakest part of the meal was the enchilada. It tasted kind of the like the ones you would find in a TV dinner... not in terms of being reheated, but the ingredients tasted identical. Oh, also we were distraught with the rice, which was simply buttery instead of Spanish.\n\nOverall, the place probably deserves a 2.5, as we have been to far worse locations that have been given a two, but its not quite high enough to earn that three.", "author": "Sami R."}

We stumbled into this place after driving by Pizzetta 211 and seeing it was too packed. Having sworn off trying mexican food in SF after too many disappointing experiences, did I really want to give this place a chance?\n\nI was a little hung over from the night before, and a good mexican dinner with a couple strong, tasty margaritas would really hit the spot so I thought...lets go for it.\n\nFrom the moment the chips and salsa hit the table, I was sold. We got fresh, warm chips salted perfectly with 2 types of salsa which were very good. I got a 3 item combo, with excellent tasting beans. ( I typically judge a mexican place off its beans, chips, and guac, then the crispy taco, flavor of enchilada sauce, and tortilla quality) All of these things ranged from pretty good to excellent. \n\nFrom now on, this is our place when I feel like gorging myself on mexican food and margaritas. It is worth the trip....which actually wasnt too bad from Noe. Plus there is a parking lot right around the corner which only charges $1 per hour. I fundamentally have an issue paying $10 for parking on $12 mexican combo plates so the parking situation coupled with everything else makes this place ideal.", "author": "susan c."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-09-29", "description": "This place remains a mystery to me. Aside from the availability of margaritas served by friendly bartenders, this restaurant traffics in one thing and one thing only: poor food that's overpriced. \n\nThis isn't Mexican food. It isn't a fresh American take on Mexican food. This is the food you have at your friend's house when you sleep over in elementary school, and you are faced at the dinner table with a bunch of cheese, overcooked meats, undistinguished tortillas, and generic sauces piled high.\n\nUnderstand, it is a fun spot -- its facade makes the street corner lively, and the front bar section is always active. But the food itself is so substandard, especially in a city with this much good Latin American eats to choose from, you have to wonder how it doesn't only stay in business, but appears to thrive.\n\nRichmond District Mexican is pretty limited. The two Gordos (on Geary and, oddly nearby, on Clement) are dependable but routine. Pancho's (on Geary, near Mel's) tries a little harder, but can't seem to decide whether to commit to Fresh or to Mex. Chino's (on Balboa, out toward the ocean) is pretty darn sloppy. Tommy's is the best of the batch (the specialty dishes are pretty good, the rest generic but dependable), but its bar is far more easily packed (and, thus, uncomfortable) than is Tia's. Maybe Tia just does well as the perceived greater of six lessers? \n\nHaving pondered this for, literally, a decade, I've come to the following conclusion. My theory is it's a combination of alcohol and families. Half the folks are drinking so many of those sweet margaritas that they're not even paying attention to the food, and half the folks are happy to find a place with food bland-but-different enough that young kids will eat it without complaining. I guess that makes Tia the TGIF of the Richmond District.", "author": "OuterLands X."}

The food was mediocre, par for a cheap mexican joint off the beaten path.  Nothing special:fajitas, enchiladas, rellenos, etc.  Obviously people don't go there for the food.  It's for the drinks.  \n     The bar was littered with sloppy drunk old dudes... at 7pm on a Tuesday!!!!!  It must be the local drunk hangout.  I'm all for establishing a local watering hole.  But I am also for cutting off stumbling drunk idiots yelling at the top of their lungs in a family restaurant.  What's worse is you have to walk past the sea of drunk to get to the host stand, where they ignore you for about five minutes  while the employees gossip.  Where is the host you ask?  Why, she is basking in the attention she is getting from the slobs as they all stand around her with their tongues hanging out of their mouthes.  \n     While the slobs at the bar guzzled down their drinks one after another, (getting louder and stupider in an already confined space), we waited 15 mins for 2 bottled beers.  The service?  Pretty sucky.  The staff was all too willing to sit down and shoot the shit with the regulars while completely ignoring everyone else.  Maybe our food took 40 minutes because it was sitting under the heat lamp while the staff jerked off.\n    Any restaurant where the staff sits down with their friends in the middle of dinner rush is not an establishment I care to visit again.  You would need the best, cheepest food and drinks in the world to get me to put up with that sad excuse for service.", "author": "Tyler J."}

I love category number 3, especially when the food is decent, who comes here for the food anymore than you'd put gas in a car without an engine. \n\nThe ideal category 3 Mexican restaurant has ridiculously strong and ridiculously cheap margaritas, fresh and spicy salsa, decent chips, and (in a perfect world) a patio to let the tequila- lime joy unfold on... A triplesec covered, tequila infused proscenium (if you will). \n\nGetting back to Tia's, it has a few things going for it off the bat: Weird soft white loungey lighting? Check. Huge round bar that seems to take up the entire restaurant? Check.  Hot hostess? Check.  Vaguely Andy Garcia bartender serving extra strong drinks to the ladies at the bar? Check. The margaritas are strong in their own right (especially the doubles) and the enchiladas are really quite good. I actually like these margaritas just as much as Tommy's... They give you two kinds of salsa with your chips too. All in all, I would be completely content here if they had a patio, which they don't.

Nothing wrong with the food here or the drinks but nothing deserving hyperbole either.\n\nLarge, dimly lit and casual, Tia is a fine place to bring a group of mates or your family. If you're alone, sit at the bar and talk to the locals. If you're with friends-of-friends (or worse, with your significant other's co-workers ;) ) asked to be sit up front in a booth. This is so you can see the flat-screen television, where baseball, basketball and other sports spool endlessly.\n\nRegarding Tia vs Tommy's, without question Tommy's makes better margaritas but their food has a Yucatanean bent to it. This wonderful in it's own right but if what you're in the mood for is a more basic restaurant burrito, taco, etc you might find Tia more appealing.\n\nSuggestions: if asked if you want hot or mild salsa get both. The hot is quite hot for some people but the mild has almost no heat (though it's tasty). For a change of pace, try the Guatemalan Tostada. It's topped with chunks of their Pollo Asada and the pineapple/sour dressing they pour over it really works well. You'll be greeted by an enormous mound of lettuce that may make you wonder if you did the right thing by listening to me, but dig deep down and you'll find there's black beans and lots of jack cheese sandwiched between two flour tortillas - more than enough substantial food to fill your tummy and then some.", "author": "Ben S."}

The flavor is like Chicken Rice-a-roni but milder.  But the beans are deliciously topped with that sizzling white cheese.  And I recommend asking them for HOT sauce.  If you mix it with the salsa they give you, it's TOPS.  \n\nI had a chicken taco, cheese enchilada and shredded beef and bean burrito (for a combo plate, the burrito is was HUGE).  I had some of my boyfriend's chile relleno.  Everything was awesome.  The flan was perfect too.\n\nGo here for the best mexican family restaurant I've seen yet in these parts.  It's still a BIT pricey ($15 for my 3-item combo) but I have another meal out of it and it was the bomb.  And their margaritas are nice and strong and not heavy on the mixer.

So, I just had beer.  My girlfriend ordered chicken super nachos.  I love nachos.  Anyhow, my drunk ass starts eating the nachos once they arrive, and then I realize.... hmmmm, this doesn't taste like chicken.  They gave us meat instead of chicken.  The only problem is, I don't eat cow.  So, I was disgusted.  I know, I know it's my drunk ass' fault.  But still....  \n\nI really like the restaurant itself.  It reminds me of Mexican restaurants in Dallas, where I'm from.  Also, the staff was very nice.  My drunk ass forgot my jacket, and they came outside to find me to give it to me.

The chips were good, but the salsa looked and tasted like it had come from a bottle...not bad, just not noteworthy.\n\nThe menu is fairly simple Sonoran fare (tacos, enchiladas, etc.). Between the three of us, we had chiles rellenos, enchiladas, tamales, and a chimichanga (not really Mexican, I know). The tamales were excellent: fresh and with lots of carne. The chiles rellenos were about a 7 on a 1-10 scale as were the enchiladas (a bit bland) and the chimichanga.\n\nThe rice was odd in that it looked and tasted like rice pilaf. It was definitely not traditional Mexican rice...although it tasted fine. The refried beans were also bit bland.\n\nGood Mexican food in SF is very hard to find, but by SF standards, I would give this place 3.5 stars. (it would get two stars in San Diego).

If you walk into an authentic Mexican restaurant and you and your friend are the only Mexicans in the place turn and run!\n\n The food at Tia Margaritas was far from appetizing; in fact it was as far from Mexican as Mexican food could be. I order the combination place (the small combo plate, you have a choice of three), which consisted of Spanish rice, refried beans, 1 enchilada, and 1 chile relleno (you have a choice of two items to go with your sides. 1 enchilada, 1 Taco, 1 chile relleno, 1 Fluata or 1 burrito).\n\nNow I am not sure were the chef went to cooking school but it definitely did not specialize in Mexican cuisine. The Spanish rice was made with Risotto style rice, the salad came covered in Salsa, and the refried beans, basically tasted like a 50 cent can of refried beans.\n\nThe chips and so-called salsa did little for me. The salsa seemed to be made from ketchup and cocktail sauce with a hint of chopped onions.\n\nThe staff was friendly and nice and was very attending, and polite.\n\nUnfortunately the only thing authentic about Tia Margarita's was there selection of beer.\n\nThis place should change there name to Aunt Margaret's and their Menu.

In fact, don't eat anything but the chips, salsa, guacamole, and sauteed chicken (on the app menu) and wash all of that down with about a dozen delicious margaritas.\n-If you are in the company of small children, you will be drawn to TM because it appears that the noise of a small child might be easily absorbed by the raucous crowd. Your instincts are correct but it will be so noisy and claustrophobic that even the most precocious and outgoing little people will be overwhelmed. And you will probably find yourself overwhelmed too.\n-Sit at the bar. The table and chair configuration is awkward and hard to navigate and the back dining room feels like a cave. \n-Don't bother if you're looking to get in and out fast. Service is excellent and every last person working here was incredibly helpful and pleasant.

I have not been this disappointed with a restaurant since I found a paper clip in a Thai Fried Rice dish at Lemongrass on Polk back in 2005. \n\nWe found one of those free San Francisco restaurant guides a wee while back, I forget which one exactly. This place was written up as being one of the cities best Mexican eateries, so we were eager to try it out one Sunday afternoon and even took a friend. When we arrived there appeared to be a few people sat in the front of the restaurant and there was a nice bustling ambiance. All seemed well. This little old lady lead us away from the 'atmospheric' front room into a darkly lit back room and stuck us completely alone in the back of the restaurant completely away from everyone else (and there were plenty of tables up front). We thought that was, well, a bit odd. I ordered Chimichangas (I think that's what they're called), and what I got was a plate of shredded lettuce, Lay's Mild Salsa strewn across it as if it were spilled, a cold pile of Uncle Ben's Basmati Rice complete with neon yellow coloring and three tiny shrivelled up Taquito's that resembled those ones you get from Trader Joe's and microwave for a minute (y'know the ones, we've all bought 'em)\n\nDisgusting? Yes pretty much, certainly if you take into account how much I paid for this. And when I asked for a soda refill, Grandma Waitress threw a hissy fit my way shouting at me that \"there are NO refills\" and that \"I must pay for another one!!\" Well I never! My boyfriend Oscar is of Mexican decent, and therefor knows what real Mexican food looks and tastes like. He said that his grandmother would have had a heart attack if she had seen how repulsive, cheap and sloppy the Mexican food was here! Because that lady knows how to whip up some tacos, something apparently Tia Margarita lacks. Everyone elses food sucked just as bad, and also came complete with a serving of Uncle Ben's and a whole lotta attitude.\n\nThis place was disgusting! I would never return.

The whole first dining room is just tables ringed around the bar.  I guess the margaritas are important here.  I didn't have one.\n\nThe service was quick and businesslike.  The chips they brought were mostly crunched into small pieces but they were good.  The salsa was like pureed tomatos; very little spice.  Fortunately I like mild salsa so I was pretty happy with it.\n\nI ordered a combo plate with two shredded beef tacos.  The refried beans were not great.  They have this certain taste, maybe it's chili or something but it's a taste I do not like in my beans.  I like my refritos salty and beany.  There was plenty of cheese melted on top of the beans though; I moved the beany cheese over to the rice and ate it together to give it some flavor.  The rice wasn't very much like the spanish rice I'm used to in Mexican restaurants; it was pretty much plain white rice.  So, rice and beans, eh.\n\nThe tacos were really good!  The taco shells were just regular pre-folded corn tortillas, the kind you get at the grocery store in a box, but it was OK because the shredded beef was GOOD.  It was the kind of shredded beef that's very flavorful from soaking in salty tomato-y sauce for a long time.  The tacos were covered with some of that salsa-like tomato dressing that Mexican restaurants put on their salads, and a big ol' scoop of guacamole.  Yum!  There was one black olive for garnish.  And the whole shmear was piled atop a big stack of lettuce with tomato dressing.  I couldn't finish all the salad but it was pretty good too.\n\nAll in all, this is a decent place to get shredded beef tacos, but not rice and beans, and I'd rather go to Tommy's.  Tommy's was closed tonight which is how I ended up at Tia Margarita's, but I don't know when I'll go back.", "author": "Lorelei S."}

This was my first Mexican food experience since returning from living in Mexico City, so I wasn't expecting much outside of the Mission. Well, I was right. We waited about 25 minutes for a table, which wasn't too bad, but then we were seated and practically ignored. When our waitress finally came over, she was less than pleasant. In fact, I don't think the miserable gal smiled once. She seemed annoyed when I asked for extra napkins. I ordered a combination plate and specified that I didn't want tomatoes on antyhing. Imagine my suprise when my food was covered in salsa/tomatoes.... And the food? Eh, it was mediocre Americanized Mexican food--very, very greasy. I probably would not go back there.

I used to be a La Barca fan back when the food was good 20 plus years ago and had been looking for a family style Mexican restaurnat in this neighborhood. The place was still hopping after 9 pm and the margaritas were a killer as many yelpers can attest! I came back a second time within the past month for dinner again and was not dismayed. Portions are large and my wife and mother in law each ordered a single taco with the works and that was plenty for them. On the other hand, I ordered the 3 item combo which included 2 enchiladas and the burrito and was not disappointed. The male server from our first visit remembered me and acknowledged that \"we had come back\" which was nice. I happened to strike up a conversation with the hostess as I am also in the food business and introduced myself as having been a neighborhood resident.

I typically bring friend's and family that are in town for a visit and have yet to hear a complaint from anyone. Francisco behind the bar - hooking up the wicked margaritas is worth the trip alone. I am particualrly fond of the Chef's Special combo platter - huge, HOT plate of Pollo Asada, Garlic Prawns and the best Carne Asada (drenched in onions which seem to be cilantro, lime infused - SO GOOD). I seldom wander from this dish unless it's just to get the Carne Asada dinner plate alone. One day I will try something else.....I have another 20 or 30 good years though to get to the rest of the menu. I have never received anything other than exeplary service, though as a long-time customer, that may have something to do with it.  Either way, I don't care.

The drinks are reasonably priced (could have a bigger tequila selection, but the put in a good effort).  Food portions are definitely on the large side.

The long wait (45 min) for a table for two was occupied by drinking quite possibly the strongest rocks w/salt margarita I've ever had.  I would come back just for the margy, which was made by the most cheerful bartender I've encountered in quite some time.  Unfortunately the chips were a bit stale, but the salsa was tasty and had just the right amount of kick for my taste.  Ordered the Tacos Dorados, (I think...again, the margy) one of each of the chicken and the ground beef.  Both had a nice flavor and the guacamole piled on top tasted fresh.  All in all, a good standby when I'm looking for a fun evening with some tasty food.", "author": "Kate N."}

We had reservation, and they seated us right away (PLUS especially with kids).  They were quick on serving us chips and salsa.  The food was pretty good.  \n\nI'm a bit a surprise that they consider themselves \"good place for kids\".  If they were kid friendly, they should've been more equipped with high chairs.  Throughout the whole restaurant, I've only saw TWO highchairs.  The hostess said that we will NOT get a highchair during our dinner because it's being used and other customers are waiting for one as well.   She asked if we wanted a booster chair.  I prefer not to use a booster for a 11 month old baby because it's not safe.  The table next to us was using two highchairs, and once they left, they gave one highchair to the table next to us who came after us.  But they never asked me if we still wanted one.  \n\nAnother thing to add - our waitress could've been a little bit more friendly and more attentive.  She didn't smile when she first came to our table.  When she took our order, it was very hard to hear what she was saying because it's a fairly noisy restaurant.  She didn't come around to fill our water glasses.  She only came once to ask us how we were doing.  \n\nI've been here a couple of times in the past and this was the worst experience I had.  If it wasn't for the food, I would've given them a lower rating.", "author": "S K."}

It gets four stars because this place delivers what it promises -- classic over-Americanized Mexicanish food paired with cheap drinks.\n\nContrary to what others say, it doesn't matter what you order.  Everything you get will be smothered in cheese and taste vaguely of lard.  Besides, you'll be drunk by the time the food comes.  The food tastes good, but how could it not when it's smothered in cheese? If you must pick a particular item, I recommend the flauta.  It's huge and covered in sour cream and guacamole, not to mention that it's a deep fried flauta.\n\nThe drinks are awesome here.  The margaritas are great, like everyone says. It's not like that crud they serve you at Chevy's that is filled with crushed ice and no tequila.  However, the house wine is a cheaper option if you are a creep like me.  For $10.50, you get a liter of wine.  Drink it up.\n\nNow, the service.  I almost dropped it down a star.  There's this one old lady waitress who's always there, and she sucks.  She moves slower than you can believe.  The real problem is that she is pure evil.  If you ask her a question that she doesn't want to answer, she ignores it.

It's probably not a bad idea to get a salad with your dinner...if you have room.  The portions are certainly generous, and the fresh salsas that come with the complimentary tortillas are really good.

They are definitely very good, too--and I'm not at all a tequila fan.  As Michelle mentioned, the decor is definitely a step apart from anywhere else I've been in the city...I seem to recall vaulted ceilings, plenty of dark wood, medieval-looking chandeliers, and stained glass.  Somehow it all feels more festive than a Catholic church, which I'm realizing is what I've just described--just go and check it out yourself, and get one blended with salt on the rim.", "author": "Michael T."}

I've been a here a few times and my friends and I were thinking about checking out another overrated Mexican joint in the area, Tommy's, but didn't want to deal with the ruckus there.  In the same neighborhood, Tia Margarita is a nicer layout, and a little more upscale but with similar prices.  The margaritas are second only to Tres Agaves, but the food is hit and miss.  I've ordered the garlic shrimp in the past, and have loved it, but I went for red meat and was left a little disappointed.  The service is middle ground, but they don't pull the margaritas out of pitcher, and you have to wait for each one to be individually blended.  My friend Dave noted that behind the bar was a cluster of American Flags which was a first for me to see in a Mexican restaurant with out the flag of Mexico in site.  I mean, I'm sure it doesn't mean anything, but it led to an interesting and fun conversation.  After eating at Tia, it is routine to go to Trad'r Sam's afterwards and watch people get shit faced.", "author": "Adam M."}

Needless to say, it struck a chord with me.  The food was good - above average, but not on par with the elite places, especially in San Fran.  The drinks were super good.  Really stiff margarita (not really much more than a beer, scotch or gin drinker).  The service was super good and everything came out very fast.  Tried the chicken taco and enchilada - good, but not worth 12 bucks.  Beans and rice were...well...beans and rice.

The atmosphere is really a a little piece of Mexican/European Heaven in the Richmond.  The food is great, service is great, salsa is wonderful, the portions are enormous!!  Try to get a waitress named SAndra.  She is amazing. WE have had her wait on us twice. She constantly checks to make sure everything is okay.. is really attentive to more chips, drinks, salsa, etc... and most importantly, if you have a kid, she is amazing with them and can defuse any toddler situation imaginable in a second, making the dining experience even more pleasant for the parents.The bartender who I can only distinguish by the fact that he is BAsque is awesome.  There's another awesome latin American server who rocks and remembers us every time and is gracious and courteous.  There's a couple of employees that seem a little grumpy but- achh.. we avoid them. This place is great. Great value, good food, friendly people.   If they are not too booked, you should ask to be seated in one of Sandra's (lovely Irish lass') table.", "author": "joanne g."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-02-08", "description": "Okay, here's my two-cents worth (actually $12.50 plus tax).  Someone mentioned \"comfort food,\" and they're right on the money!  This place is something of an iconic holdover from another era, namely its founding date of 1964.  If you happen to have a special place in your heart for fairly homogenous California Mexican \"cuisine\" (I hesitate a little to use such a dignified term), then Tia delivers the goods in a goodly fashion.  Someone mentioned the chicken breast asada, which I think is really one of their signature dishes.  Someone else mentioned the gambas (prawns) in garlic and butter, which is quite how I remember the dish being served in Mexican coastal towns.  I enjoy both of these preparations very much and am partial to their salsa verde (tomatillo sauce) enchiladas as well.  For me, Tia does a nice job of satisfying the need for a neighborhood comfort-style restaurant.  As for quality, two comments:  First, the margaritas are disappointing in ways previously mentioned.  The most egregious is that they have NO 100% agave tequilas from which to make a premium drink (remember, Tia resides in a time warp!).  If you happen to live in the present, you have little choice but to cap your meal off with a walk down to Tommy's for a properly composed margarita.  My second observation about quality is that I suffered through some pretty bad meals at Tia Margarita during 2007 and into 2008.  Most notably food tended toward the salty and soggy, and there were other problems, too.  Then, sometime around mid-year everything got noticeably better.  The food quality has remained consistently up-to-par for the past six or eight months, so I guess it's not a fluke.  They must have fired the cook, and now I needn't apologize to anyone--especially myself--for enjoying the fare.  One tip:  There are some wacky (hard of hearing?  inattentive? distracted?) older waitresses who serve the dining rooms.  I suppose one could say these servers are charming in their own way, but for my money I prefer the gracious and attentive food service Antonio provides in the lounge.  Enjoy!", "author": "Ron L."}

Seeing that it was my first time there, the no-nonsense waitress asked, \"Something to drink for you?\" And I'd just been seated at the table so I just replied, \"I'll just have water for now.\" The waitress snapped back as if I didn't understand the question, \"Something to drink from the BAR?\" I said again, \"No thanks, maybe later, just water.\" She looks blankly at me and then moves on to take another beverage order. I'm not asking to be patronized here but seriously, cold service does not encourage me to return to the restaurant. As dinner went on, she seemed much more polite and attentive but the food was just okay, it lacked bold flavors that I'm used to with Mexican food.

I had dinner there this past weekend and out of our party of five, three of us had tamales. They were nasty. Beyond nasty, actually. They were downright disgusting. They were supposed to be beef but they looked more as though they were filled with something trapped (and slaughtered) in the kitchen. Service here is usually okay but avoid -at all cost - the ditzy old lady who still waits tables, although she should have laid down her order pad 20 years ago. She is rude and invariably screws up at least  one order in  your party. No lie. You can count on it. Another caveat - the noise factor is quite an issue. Don't go there expecting a quiet dinner for two. Uh-uh. Besides the crowd at the bar (who get rather boisterous after a few belts and there's some sports show on the TV) there are always the stalwart parents who insist on bringing their screaming offspring with them.

I was appalled besides being angry! The restaurant personnel didn't think or care that we would have spent $$ if they didn't inform us that we need to leave their establishment. We were not loud or behaving inappropriately, but now realize they did not appreciate us or want our business. I will never return here again or recommend this establishment to any one.
