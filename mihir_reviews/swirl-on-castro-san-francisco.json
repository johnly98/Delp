Opened the 2015 \"Here Be Monsters\" Nebbiolo Friday night to find an 1/8 of an inch of red sediment slime on the cork as well as around the neck and crown of the bottle.  Immediately recorked it.  On Sunday, returned the bottle to Swirl.  The man who sold us the bottle was there as well as, according to their website, the owner and winemaker.  We wanted our money back for this badly unfiltered wine.  We did not get it.  We were offered an exchange for another bottle of the same inferior product, with the owner's look of contempt.  We left the bottle on their counter and walked out.  We spoke to two Sommelier friends of ours and they both said the same thing, that the slime is indeed sediment, but that that is too much which means the bottler syphoned deep into the barrel to get more yield resulting in this unpleasant slime.  The Sommeliers also said however slimy it may be, it's perfectly harmless, though it can be unpleasant to swallow and taste a bit bitter.  So no thank you Swirl...you have lost two customers all over an inferior $35 Nebbiolo that you refused to refund.\n\n@Swirl...Your owner's customer service skills with unhappy customers are severely lacking.  the gentleman who originally sold us your inferior Nebbiolo, at least was smiling and kind.  The owner on the other hand showed nothing but contempt on his face.  As stated, you have lost two customers and further we want nothing from you for your horribly handled situation.", "author": "Stan D."}

It's been on my bookmarks for quite a while, but we just never seemed to make a point of popping in. \n\nThis little wine store made my day this past Sunday.  Not only are the prices extremely reasonable, but the products they carry are the best.  We were particularly impressed by their wine selection - while not extensive, they offer a selective offering of quality wines at a range of prices.  You can definitely find a bottle under $40 that packs some bang for your buck.  \n\nThe found the people working there to be extremely helpful and knowledgeable.  We were trying to find something to bring with us to pair with our dinner at Flour & Water later that evening, and one of the gentlemen working there pointed out a range of bottles that would pair nicely.  \n\nAnother nice touch - we noticed that one of the wines we were considering for our dinner later that evening was open in their tasting area.  They were kind enough to pour a small sample to see if it was something we were interested in.  Well, it was delicious, so we ended up going with that one.  \n\nWe also were so excited to see wines we've \"had our eye on\" but have been extremely difficult to find.  We walked out with a few bottles in hand, and a mental note to make this \"the\" place to go for future wine purchases.  And also walked away with our eyes on a few particular suggestions they mentioned - next time (there will always be a next time for these wine-o's!!) :)", "author": "Rachael S."}

It's not.  The wines they carry are fun and interesting and not the run-of-the mill stuff.  They carry wines that they themselves find interesting and intriguing, and can talk to you about the details of them.  But my favorite part is the wine tasting options--yes, they have wine tastings and little tables in the back where you can enjoy them.  You can do flights or choose glasses, and the guy that was there when we've always been there (KC) truly is knowledgeable but not an air of arrogance or snootyness at all.  \n\nI love how they have their wines arranged in \"boldness\" or by \"splurge\"...a new way of arranging wines, but also helpful to the wine novice as well I'm sure.  If you keep an eye out they have some really good finds for great prices as well.  We will continue to go back when we find ourselves in that area of SF.", "author": "Brad D."}

A couple of hours at a karaoke bar turns into an after party at a stranger's house til 5 a.m. On a weeknight.

That they categorize their wines in flavor groups like, \"Big Reds,\" so you can check out what you want according to the dish you are making or the mood you are in.  It's like a Dewey Decimal System for wines.\n\n4.  Jerry, the owner, is crazy knowledgeable about wine, but shows no pretentiousness.  He's friendly and helpful and sassy.\n\n3.  The casual level of customer service from all staff there.  I love walking in and telling the staff what I am cooking for dinner and having them pull out some options.  If I tell them, \"weeknight price ranges, please,\" they show NO attitude.  I was once shown 'the cheapest of our good sauvignon blancs' with actual pride.\n\n2.  The wine bar is small and often filled, which means that you will meet people very quickly.  Don't be afraid!  Squeeze your booty in there , smile, and request, \"what good reds are you showcasing right now?\"  You will soon have 4 new friends commenting on your wines and complimenting your new hairdo.\n\n1.  Timmyloo rocks my world!  He's the staffer with the sweet smile and shock of red hair.  Last night I went in there 5 minutes after closing... Oops!  But as Timmyloo was tipping back an amazing Zin with a lovely drunken drag queen, he invited me to stay and sip with them.  He's a wonderful conversationalist and every time I visit him he teaches me more about wine without coming across like a knowitall.  Beware!  Timmyloo will figure out your tastes and you will end up buying 4 bottles when you only came in for a glass!  Of course, onlyt after he has sipped a few glasses with you.  Salut to Timmyloo!

The selection of wines is second rate, at best, and most of what's on offer is way overpriced. And forget about being greeted and made welcome, the only thing these guys want is your money. Period. Shop elsewhere and have a better time, better wine, and customer service.\nUPDATE: Heard from the owner, Jerry, who threatened me in his emessage. He didn't bother to open dialogue, just displayed the source of the poor attitude I have encountered at Swirl, but this time it was very personal and explicit. And his use of vulgar language in his reply was pretty much what one would expect.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-03-21", "description": "My new favorite place in the Castro is this lovely little wine shop and bar. The bar is really small, there's four or five stools along the serving area and two small tables in the back. But there's a lovely little garden out back with lots more room for wine-loving Castroites, their cute little doggies and their lush gal pals visiting for the weekend.\n\nWe did a flight of reds for $11.50 and I would have taken home a bottle of each if I hadn't just bought a case of wine the day before. The wine cabinet in the corner of my living room has expanded to a set of boxes piled in the corner. The madness must stop somewhere. But, anyway, back to the review. If you have some time to ponder your selection, why not take a seat and try some out? In addition to flights, they'll serve tastes and glasses, poured with a heavy hand, God bless them. \n\nThree favorite things about Swirl:\n\n1) Really nice staff, not pretentious at all. As much or as little attention as you want.\n\n2) I really liked the way the shop is organized. As you walk in, bubbly is the first thing on your right, and across from that is the booze. Wine occupies the whole right side of the shop. Most wine shops organize by origin or varietal, but Swirl is organized more by your personal taste in wine. One section is called something like \"robust reds.\" There's also a small section simply labeled \"Splurge.\" \n\n3) I don't know a lot about wine, I couldn't articulate a good description of what I'm drinking or explain why certain grapes do well in certain regions. However, I really know how to drink the stuff. I mean, I have that part DOWN. I didn't recognize many of the wines here and that's pretty unusual for me. I really like that you could wander into Swirl and have a pleasant natter with the staff and go home with some fun new find. \n\nIf I'm spending the weekend in the Castro, wine is probably the only tasty thing I'll be taking home with me, at least if I pick it up at Swirl I know I'll end up satisfied.

As others have already pointed out, Swirl is a wine shop with a small tasting bar in the back.  However, unlike other similar establishments, most of the people in the shop were there to taste rather than shop for wine, so I did not feel out of place ordering a glass of wine.  \n\nI tried a glass of the TreViti pinot noir which I really enjoyed - it was fruit forward, and I did not detect much, if any, oak.  The bottle of wine retails for $30 at the store (and on the winery website), and they were charging $7 per glass, so the mark-up on the glass was relatively modest.  \n\nSwirl carries wines from boutique/smaller wineries, which I appreciate.  They also stock a variety of hard liquor (for example, Hangar One vodka).  The shop isn't big nor the selection vast, but I think that the wine buyer has made some excellent choices.  I will definitely return for my alcohol needs.\n\nI think that Swirl is a great place to stop by for a glass of wine before a meal (I'm sure that whatever they are pouring is better and more reasonably priced than your wine options at your average restaurant in the Castro).  Also, if you're like me and like to browse wines, then you might enjoy nursing a glass of wine while you peruse. I would not, however, recommend Swirl as a destination for a night out because the space is small and the atmosphere lacking (again, it's more of a store than a bar).", "author": "Grace W."}

They have nice wines, the staff is really nice, unpretentious, and its not some big overcrowded wine bar, b/c its really a wine shop.  i will do more sampling there in the near future for sure.", "author": "M K."}

But the real reason I like Swirl is that it's a civilized place to get a drink in the Castro.  I'm starting to dread happy hours at Badlands but I still want to meet the boys (and girls) for a drink in the hood sometimes.  Swirl is perfect.  Always laidback, friendly service and a good selection of wines by the glass.  And their Thursday tastings are fun.  Reserve early or they sell out!  A very welcome addition to the 'stro.", "author": "Michael E."}

I wandered in to buy some wine for a friends dinner party and wandered out with 2 bottles of wine, 2 bottles of liquor and a warm fuzzy feeling. The gentleman behind the counter was exceptionally friendly (and has been every time I have been back). This is a great place to stock your wine rack and liquor cabinet. Sure, its not the cheapest place to buy alcohol, but the service is great and you're supporting a local business. Check it out!", "author": "Jamie M."}

Hey! That's right, there's Swirl! And while I can't afford 90% of what they have on sale, there are usually several nice selections under 10 bucks. Most importantly for me, Jerry the owner consistently donates to community and HIV/AIDS causes. And, um, that's socially responsible capitalism and we love that!", "author": "Stephen S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-08-03", "description": "This is a terrific little wine shop with a great selection. The wines are organized in a very customer friendly way, which is appreciated by those of us who don't quite know all their is to know about wine yet, but are working on it. Though I have never attended one of their Thursday night tastings officially, I have stopped by to grab a bottle on Thursday nights and everyone seems to be having a good time. In fact, on one Thursday, one of the customers attending the wine tasting took me under his wing and talked me into trying a Spanish wine that turned out to be delightful. I will say that I haven't been overly impressed by the helpfulness of the staff, but that seems to not be the experience of other reviewers, so maybe it is just me.", "author": "Claire B."}

I have a wine refrigerator full of their stuff and a small table groaning under the weight of the liquor I've bought from this store.  The staff is friendly and knows their stuff.  And they've got a great little bar in the back if you had a hard day shopping and want to have a glass of wine or have them pop open any beer or wine in the shop.  I've done that quite a few times.  Their beer selection is good, but doesn't change very often.  There's a great discount wine section in the back and lower priced items up front for everyday consuption.  While the back has all the best stuff.  On some Thursdays they have a tasting party that you need a reservation for.  I've been to two.  I'm a bit phobic about crowds so being mashed in with a bunch of people I don't know while tasting wine or beer isn't for me, but it was a fun experience and opened my horizons to other types of beer and wine I hadn't tried before.  I took home a bottle of my favorite Kasteel beer brewed with cherries today for a little day off treat.", "author": "Michael D."}
