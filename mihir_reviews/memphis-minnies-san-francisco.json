As we walked closer, we noticed the steam warming up the restaurant from all of the BBQ cooking. We also liked how each table had its own paper towel roll, as it can get pretty messy when we eat BBQ! We thought long and hard and ended up ordering some mac 'n' cheese, potato salad, a cornbread muffin, 1/2 pound of brisket, and some pork. \n\nThe mac 'n' cheese was very cheesy, much more so than I am used too! Nonetheless, I appreciated all the cheddar cheese that was drowning the pasta. The pasta was a good balance between firm and soft, making this some great mac 'n' cheese! \n\nThe potato salad was also tasty! I appreciated how there were large chunks of red potato lodged into the potato salad. Furthermore it looked like Memphis Minnie's put in the effort to really make this potato salad worth our money - the scoop is almost overflowing out of the bowl! \n\nThe cornbread muffin tasted pretty average compared to the rest of the sides. I think it would have tasted good if I had this first or by itself, but compared to the first two sides, it didn't impress me as much. Still, I did like how the sides were crispy, but the inside was very soft. \n\nThe brisket was savory, but it didn't have as much fat as most brisket does - which can be either a good or bad thing for you, depending on what you're looking for. Because of that, it also wasn't dripping in its own juices as well. Nonetheless, I liked how the slices were easy to cut and the pieces were quite large. \n\nThe pork was somewhat dry for some of its pieces, which was something I didn't like about it. However, it still tasted pretty savory as well. Even though it was dry, it wasn't tough; it was still easy to cut and wasn't too chewy. Still, I am glad we ordered the pork. \n\nI'm so glad I was able to try out Memphis Minnie's before leaving San Francisco! It definitely made me feel a bit nostalgic, as someone who has lived in the South before recently moving. Definitely a great place to try some home style BBQ!", "author": "Liselle L."}

I got the rib tips which came in a large potion with your choice of sides, and corn bread. The meat had a great smoke flavor and was tender. The rib tips have bones, so if that's not your thing order something else. \n\nThese sides were good and the cornbread was hot. It came with a few sides of bbq sauce. The sauce was a bit on the vinegar side. \n\nI also tried the banana pudding. Omg it was amazing. Very traditional, not fancy, and a large potion. If you like vanilla pudding and fresh banana then I would recommend it. \n\nOnly con was the box the food came in looked like it and felt like it was rubbed in sauce, multiple cooks wiped their hands on it, and was dipped in a vat of oil. The entire outside of box was filthy! Maybe they could pack it with clean hands and wipe the counter off.", "author": "Alan H."}

SF lives just two blocks away from this joint thankfully, so we just walk down when were getting those bbq cravings. It's an order and sit down type of establishment. They have signs that remind customers to only sit down after you've ordered which is nice. There's a limited number of tables but I've never had an issue with seating here. At the tables, there are 4 different type of Memphis Minnie sauces to go with the food. I really like  their hot sauce and their tangy sauce. They also have a vinegar type of sauce which I haven't tried yet. Plenty of paper towels in a roll on the table ftw.\n\nI've been here twice - first time I had their pulled pork sandwich and it was so filling! Loved adding the sauces onto the sandwich to get a different taste. The second time SF ordered their Tuesday special, which was a pork belly special sandwich and I got their chili cheese fries. It was so ungodly amazing. The fries were so hot that the fresh cheddar cheese melted into a gooey mess and there was tender pulled pork and freshly cut red onions as well. The pork belly sandwich is definitely a must-order if you're ever there on a Tuesday! It's a very thick slab complemented with cole slaw and choice of side. We ordered with the sweet potatoes and it was boiled with honey water, very delicious!", "author": "Ada C."}

(The boo said let's go to Memphis Minnie's. That was the occasion.)\n\nWe walked into this unassuming spot, ordered from the nicest staff who accommodated my always indecisive ordering, and somehow were able to get two massive \"half\" sandwiches each, with a huge pile of fries and Mac n cheese as our sides for something like $13ea. How are they doing bbq like this with prices like this in the heart of SF? \n\nBoyf said he'd been a regular before his more recent health kick, so he knows his way around his brisket sandwich and sauces. I went with the southern star -- half brisket, half smoked pork. They come dry, which is how I like it. You dress it how you like it with their selection of 4-5 sauces on the tables. Both meats were really good, especially the pork (mmmm fatty) and really generous portions. I was plenty full without eating most of the bread.\n\nI didn't actually like the sauces much (too watery?) or their Mac n cheese (bland and over cooked as most are), but that's really not a problem.

Not entirely their fault since getting the permits for a proper smoker in SF is basically impossible.\n\nThe sides absolutely rescue the place and the portions are good.

That said, in my California opinion, Memphis Minnie's is awesome. Almost every time I've gone, everything I've ordered has been good to great. And since I've gone probably 20 or 30 times I feel like I have a pretty informed opinion.\n\nIn my opinion, these are the best meats and sides:\n- St. Louis Style Smoked Pork Ribs\n- Slow-Smoked Texas Beef Brisket\n- Potlikker Greens\n- Minnie's Macaroni & Cheese\n\nEverything else is good, but these 4 things are the best on the menu.\n\nI also love the 4 sauces they have on every table, the spicy one isn't all that spicy and the Texas one is kind of blah, but the customization is nice. My personal favorite is the North Carolina sauce that has mustard in it, although the vinegar one is also great for cutting through the fatty, rich meat.\n\nI also have a funny story about one visit. So I was with my friend, and we both ordered food and were seated and we got to talking about how he's from LA, and he happens to be someone who enjoys smoking the marijuana. Whatever, I don't judge, and it's legal-ish now anyway.\n\nSo we're talking, and this lady at the table next to us overhears us and asks how he likes SF. She's an older lady, a little frazzled looking, and he mentions that it's nice but he misses some parts of LA and also it's cold. The lady finishes before us, and before leaving says \"hold out your hands, I got something to welcome you to San Francisco\".\n\nNo joke, he cups his hands and this lady proceeds to literally fill up his hands with marijuana. I have no idea how much, but like, way more than any normal person just carries loose on them. My friend looks like a little kid on Christmas, eyes lit up, huge smile. Me being unused to seeing drugs I was just shocked.\n\nDoes the story end there? No! Apparently my friend, who I'll now start referring to as \"my idiot friend\", went home and made the marijuana into cigarettes. Which he left on a table, that apparently isn't level. So his French Bulldog somehow knocked them off and ate them all.\n\nLuckily my idiot friend's dog was fine, but he said the dog was staring at the ceiling, drooling and unresponsive, for hours.\n\nBack to the restaurant, in my mind there are only two main issues with Memphis Minnie's. First, it pains me to say so, but sometimes the meat is a bit dry. I've watched plenty of food shows that go to real Southern BBQ spots, and the meat always looks juicy. Maybe those were bad days.\n\nSecond, obviously the prices are too high. I can eat their \"Minnie's Taster\" three meat combo no problem, which in my mind means it's too small. I feel like if you go to a BBQ place and order their largest platter, it should be way too much food to finish. Memphis Minnie's isn't there, and for $20 it's too much. Either it should be like $14, or they should seriously add 1/3 more food to it.\n\nAnyway, prices and ocasional quality issues aside, I really like this place. It's unique, the interior is kitschy and fun, and it gives me a chance to eat something that is outside the normal California fair. I sadly no longer live nearby, but I have very fond memories of when I did. Especially about that insane lady who carries around buckets of marijuana.", "author": "Sm L."}

So I was pleasantly surprised by how much I like Memphis Minnie's, I'm now kicking myself for not trying this place out sooner!\n\nWent for lunch and the boyfriend and I shared the Minnie's Taster (which was plentyyyy of food for the both of us). Sausage, brisket, ribs + slaw, beans, and added mac n cheese, here's the breakdown:\n-Sausage: really good flavor! I didn't think that the casing had much crunch though (I know, I'm nitpicking)\n-Brisket: smokey and delicious...I forgot to ask for the fatty cut (my favorite) but we got a good mix. Not the most moist brisket I've ever had, but it definitely wasn't dry\n-Ribs: I haven't had ribs that I've enjoyed this much in a longgg time. I like these so much better than 4505s (which I think is too sweet/sticky/gummy on top). These are super meaty and tender with a nice rub ;)\n-Slaw: tangy and sweet, reminds me of bread and butter pickles...couldn't get enough of the slaw!\n-Beans: Eh, not bad but I'd probably pass next time...I like 4505s baked beans much better\n-Mac N Cheese: mmm so creamy....so delicious\n\nOverall, the meats really held their own with lots of flavor, smokiness, and great texture. You can tell they do it right, low and slow, by the layer of pink on the edge of the meat once it's cut. On top of that, I did enjoy the sauces; despite being a little thinner, they had a lot of flavor...I like the mustard one the best, then the Texas red sauce.\n\nThe atmosphere is fun and laid back. The place has a lot of history and it's all over the walls. It was so refreshing to walk into a restaurant and feel like I've left the pretentiousness of San Francisco behind.

Flavor was ok. I needed to put lots of their house sauces on the barbecue to make it taste better. \n\nAndouille sausage: can't go too wrong with this. Had a nice flavor and I believe had a little spice to it. I dipped the sausage in one of their house sauces as well. \n\nChicken: best out of everything. The chicken was fried. The chicken was moist and flavorful. I still dipped it in the house hot sauce since it was delicious. \n\nMac n cheese: eh, it was ok. The consistency of the cheese was not too thin and not too thick. Too bad it was a little lacking in flavor.\n\nCornbread: dry \n\nBeans: tasty! I liked how there was meat mixed in it! \n\nGreens: very tasty. I have never had greens with a vinegar base. I think the vinegar base helped to cut out the bitterness that greens sometimes tend to have. \n\nService: excellent. The lady that helped us was very informative and friendly. She kept checking up on us to make sure everything was ok. I know, perhaps the owner will respond and ask why I didn't tell her how I really felt about the food.

That's what I was thinking when I came upon what looked like a red barn of a restaurant with farm animals painted in front. The interior could use some sprucing up. Like a lot of these bbq/soul food/diner type of spots, it was also decorated with a lot of knick knacks, t-shirts on the walls, and various accolades hung up. One thing I was wondering, how can I enjoy pork when there are so many pictures of cute piglets on the walls?\nI am quite green when it comes to the art of barbecue, but I appreciate the labor of love that goes into it. We shared the Two Way Combo (22.95) and Minnie's Taster w/ 3 Meats ($26.95). Both come with 2 small sides & a cornbread muffin.\n\nSt. Louis Style Smoked Pork Ribs - great smokey flavor, a little dry, but of course the house sauces saved them.\nSlow-Smoked Texas Beef Brisket - definitely very tasty, but a little dried out.\nSmoked Chicken - surprisingly, I enjoyed chicken the most. The skin developed a nice crunch and the meat was tender. \nCornbread muffin - yummy, hard to go wrong with a corn muffin, & slightly oily on the outside.\nMinnie's Macaroni & Cheese - thick & gooey, and slightly sweet.\nPotato Salad - not bad, but I didn't have too much of it, as I'm not a fan of celery & onions.\nTart n Tangy Slaw - I don't care for slaw, but the sour, cold, crunchy leaves were rather refreshing for that warm hot day.\nDeep South Sweet Potatoes - sweet & mushy.\n\nI found Memphis Minnie's food reasonably satiating, not amazing, but I remember the neighborhood-friendly service. The guy working the counter was very outgoing and offered up a free cookie to the first person who could name the artist of the soul song was playing over the speakers at the time.", "author": "Joy W."}

I've heard Memphis Minnie's BBQ for awhile, I just never made the time to go there until now.  My family and I were there last Sunday and we ordered: beef brisket plate and sandwich pulled pork plate and sandwich, and BBQ chicken.  All the meats were full of flavor and melted in your mouth.  The buns for the sandwiches were I believe brioche I maybe wrong on the brioche but it had that buttery rich flavor brioche buns have and it complimented the beef brisket sandwich.  He last time I had BBQ this good was years ago at Everett and Jones in Oakland.  As far as the sides we had the BBQ beans and seasoned fries.  The beans were delicious they were full of that sweet BBQ flavor along with a decent amount of meat. My son got the seasoned fries and they were plentiful and were not greasy.  The service was excellent everyone behind the counter were friendly and we also got our food relatively fast.  Everything was great except the price was a little steep but to tell you the truth the food was worth it.

We just love the place!!   We live in the Easy Bay and regularly drive into the city specifically to go to Memphis Minnie's.  My favorites are the Two Way Combo with Beef Brisket & Cajun sausage.  The meats are superb.  My favorite side is their Mac & Cheese.  Hands-down, the best Mac & cheese I've ever tasted.  A Two-Way Combo is a ton of food.  It really makes 3 meals for me, and that is my intention.  It's so much fun to have all those wonderful leftovers to bring home for the next few days.  On their Specials, Wednesday's is our favorite:  the Pastrami Sandwich.  I tell you, it melts in your mouth...it's so unbelievably tender.  But the single most fantastic item at Memphis Minnie's, in my eyes, is their Mustard Sauce.  At first, I wasn't even open to it...I like the traditional red BBQ sauces.  But my husband convinced me to just try it, and I was hooked!  It's just phenomenal.  Hell, I'd chug it like a beer if I could, but that would probably be a little undignified!  I will tell ya, parking is miserable.  So my husband and I do the tag-team bit and he runs in and picks up the order which we had phoned in, while I drive around the block a few times.  Then we bring our bag of deliciousness to the beach and make an afternoon or evening of it.  I've turned family and friends onto this gem and they, too, have become disciples.

I finally remembered one Wednesday to make my way out to lower haight since that is the only day they serve pastrami.\n\nPastrami Reuben - 4/5 - The pastrami here is thick cut and has a nice crust to it. In contrast to my previous disappointment here with dry meats, the pastrami was incredibly moist. It states on the description that it's cured, then smoked, then steamed so perhaps this is why this meat was so wet and flavorful. The biggest problem here is that they only put two layers of meat throughout the sandwich. When I first bit into the sandwich the flavor was totally drowned out by the rye and dressing. I did some quick surgery on it and put all of the meat one one half. This resulted in a perfectly balanced taste and quantity. The ownership should add twice the amount of pastrami layers and increase the price a few dollars to put this sandwich in contention for one of the top pastrami sandwiches in the city. \n\nRib Tips - 2/5 - Why did I order an item that I knew was going to disappoint me? No idea. But I did. And it did. It was the same as the ribs I got last time. Dry. \n\nGrit sticks - 3/5 - Interesting concept, decent side dish. Good but I wouldn't order this again.\n\nBeef ribs - 4/5 - I'm going to start by saying that in other cities, I've had much, much better beef ribs than these. Unfortunately, this is SF, which means that BBQ options are extremely limited. I can only think of a handful of places that even consistently offer smoked beef ribs as more than just the occasional special. This is unfortunate as this is my favourite BBQ meat of all. Of those options, Memphis Minnie's so far has been the best. The flavor is good, the smokiness is definitely there and the amount of meat on the bone is acceptable. It doesn't quite melt in your mouth and there are parts which are just too chewy and stiff but it definitely outshines it's competition.\n\nPeach pie - 2/5 - Dessert is unsurprisingly not the focus of this shop. This was ok but I've definitely had better hand pies.\n\nAdding to the improved experience while there, I have to make note that the manager (owner?) noticed that I had to wait an extra 30 minutes for the beef ribs and generously threw in an extra one in my takeout box. Bonus points.\n\nOverall, I was quite pleased with this visit to Memphis Minnie's and would return here for more (on wednesdays). The pastrami sandwich and the beef ribs were enjoyable and I would order both again. This time around, \"I'm a fan.\"", "author": "Mark O."}

While not open on Monday's you can double up on the Pork Belly Sandwiches on Tuesday. The thick sliced home made bacon is candied until there is a slight crack through the honey. If everyone were to vote for more bacon sides, I think it would be perfect. A half pound side of candied bacon even if it costs $20 is well worth it. I would buy more bacon to go if I knew it would not hurt their sales. A half pound of bacon is good for two to three of their Tuesday special sandwiches. \n\n I have brought in their bacon, full rack of ribs, smoke chicken wings, onion strings, corn bread, pecan pie, to my hungry coworkers for lunch and it is like feeding time on the shark shows. My coworkers line up chomping on the bit to get some great food. If the coworkers turned around in line they would see they were taking too long to fix their plate. \n\nSave the first Friday of every month for a special treat .BBQ Beef Ribs are served on the First Friday of every month. The meat on the ribs is about a pound to a pound and a half of 14 hour smoked goodness. It is $28 for just the ribs and then you can order it with two medium sides. \n\nIf you like hamburgers it is made with a mix of beef brisket and chuck, topped with home made bacon slices, pimento cheese, and more onion strings, Would love to see what a double looks like on a stacked bun but it is not on the menu.

So I was going through Yelp to see what else I can choose from. I came across this please and read the reviews just so happens that the first review that I read was from one of my friend that have been here before so I said the heck with it I trust his judgment and went for it. The place is a bit dark but that's not what matter what matters is the food and let me tell you the beef brisket is amazing. So my order was a full slab of ribs quarter pound of the beef brisket a small mac and cheese a small potato salad and two cornbread's all came out to be under $50. Yay if I knew the beef brisket was going to be this amazing like my friend wrote on Yelp I would have gotten half a pound but I didn't want to chance it I wanted to try it before which was a big mistake I should have got half a pound lol. Slab of ribs was good but nothing over the top. However their cornbread is pretty good the mac and potato salad was mediocre. Their sauce is really good. All thank to reading John's review my friend that I found a new place just in case my other place all sold out! I will definitely be back for the beef brisket.", "author": "Michele T."}

Then, if you try to save money by getting a \"2 way combo\", they won't let you get two of the same meat choices.  This is how the person taking my order informed me of that rule, \"You can't get the same meat twice!! PICK SOMETHING ELSE!\" in a very rude tone! I felt like I was being scolded.  \n\nI had called ahead to inquire about how long an order would take.  The woman told me, \"about 10 minutes\", so in an attempt to order it to coincide with the time my husband would make it there.  When I called back to order, the same lady said, \"It's going to be 20-30 minutes\" (this was about 10 minutes after I called the first time), I asked if there had been a lot of orders since I called 10 minutes ago.

Ok ok, maybe not working THAT hard, after all I came here two days in a row... Guilty confessions.\n\nThis little hole in the wall BBQ joint is an unassuming gem in the lower Haight next to UVA Unateca also a great eatery but for a nicer night out. \n\nAnyway back on track..... If you're wanting silver service BBQ this \"ain't\" your place. It's counter order walk up service and grab a table where you can find one. They serve a handful of local beers on tap and a standard menu featuring the essential BBQ and sides. From pork and beef ribs, tips, smoked meats and chicken wings I didn't feel like I had a lack of options. It was more of a challenge of what to order with limited stomach space. Unlike some other places you are only going to need 1 order bc you WILL be full and not break the bank. This is one place where you are going to have to seriously TRY to spend more than 40$ for 2 people bc I honestly think 2 people can share a main and side plus beers.\n\nI mean I'm not a total meat person though over the last year I've come out of my chicken and fish routine but seriously, I would DEVOUR pretty much everything here. The meat and sauces are right on par, everything is tender and melts in your mouth. I came back 2x in 1 week. Kind of embarrassing bc I think the cashier recognized me as in weren't you just here uhhhh YESTERDAY? Ok fine I was, but that was only bc it was so darn good and I was house sitting without many options to go to late night and was in my nasty sweats not wanting to hop in an UBER. Anyway, back to my point... I would be happy here stuffing my face in complete silence and be perfectly happy not talking to anyone else.", "author": "Audrey L."}

Today was the day and I made the trek over to see what this smoke joint could serve that was better than my last experience.\n\nWhile I write this, I am sitting at my desk and my stomach is aching, not because the food was bad but because I couldn't stop eating. Lance served me a mixed plate with brisket, chicken and a rib along with a cornbread muffin, potato salad and a bowl of pintos. \n\nLet me tell you, I am particular when it comes to brisket. The pitmaster better do it right or I'm not interested. This brisket was perfection. The amount of fat and the smoke ring were the first indicators Lance knew his business. The first bite was heaven on a fork. While I'm not a huge fan of ribs or chicken, Lance made a believer out of me. They were all perfect!\n\nAs for the sides, I loved the pinto beans. They had just a hint of sugar and cinnamon that worked perfectly to bring out the best in the beans. The cornbread was what both my grandmothers used to make and I wanted more. The potato salad was okay but nothing special.

I was happy that my food arrived still hot. Whether it was swift delivery or just good timing...I am very happy in how it arrived.\n\nI like that MM's gives you options on the sizes to choose from (small-large)..the smallest was about $1.95..which is not bad at all!\n\nNow onto the food:\n\nI ordered all sides..OK OK, you caught me I was in a carb craving mood. I ordered the yams, mac and cheese, beans and to try to make myself feel better I ordered the collard greens with a grand finale of Banana Pudding.\n\nYams- they were not the candied yams I am used to...at home or outside in a restaurant. I feel that it didn't have enough cinnamon, sugar or vanilla extract. the sauce they sat in was so thin and near see through I am not sure they had hardly any flavoring added to them.\n\nMac and cheese: ummm....I liked the shape of the noodles....No really, I was not impressed but I don't think it was the worst ever. I found the cheese to be thick and not melty.\n\nBeans: This is one of my favorite items!! I mean they had the flavor as if they had  been slow cooking for decades to absorb every flavor possible. I liked that it had pieces of ham shank floating throughout. I ate this and had the flavor in my mouth wanting more..I wish I'd ordered a large. \n\nCollard greens: OH MY..I truly have no words...I have never in my life had pickles in my greens....It felt like vinegar going down my throat. I was only able to take three bites...I even tried to mask it with the beans...I just tossed the greens. and accepted that I wasted my money.\n\nBanana pudding:  When I recieved it, it was warm...probably the heat from the other food. So I popped it in the freezer and about an hour later...I was in banana pudding heaven!! I wish there were a few more wafers inside but it was a great way to end my evening.\n\nOverall, I think I will pass on this restaurant, the meal wasnt worth the cost.

The grilled ratatouille was also pretty good, though it tasted pretty heavily of smoke.\n\nThe tart and tangy slaw was pretty good, and the potlikker greens were much more tart than I expected them to be, though still okay.

He said that he just got out of a meeting w/ the staff about food quality - what goes out the door, etc. He asked for an opportunity to get a second chance and show what they normally do, and he offered (almost insisted) that he send a do-over order out. I didn't need expect that at all but hey, free meat-sticks, so I said sure. They ended up sending over a ton of other stuff - ribs, fried chicken, beans, mac&cheese, corn muffins. Fried chicken doesn't usually travel well, but it held up ok. more important was that it was perfectly cooked/moist/etc.  The ribs we just right and the mac&cheese was hard to put down.\n\nThey didn't need to do all that and I'm not sure a lot of places would. Everybody/business makes mistakes, but a business that goes to that effort to make good gets high marks.  On top of that, the quality of the do-over-order was very good, so I'm rating accordingly.\n\nTotally bummed out. Got a slab delivered via Caviar.  The order and delivery process was easy and all good. I order a slab and it was an adequate portion - commensurate w/ the price. The ribs had just the appropriate amount of \"marbling\" and the rub wasn't bad, however there was very little indication that they had been really smoked for very long. It was more like when you cook ribs on your grill with a side of wood-chips on the side. The main problem however was that they were flat out burned on about 15% of the surface area - black charcoal carcinogenic crispy-like. Smaller end where the slab tapers down was hard as jerky.

The sweet gentleman at the counter recommended these as a side and woowee, I might live off of these greens for the rest of my life.\n4. The Mac n Cheese: Absolutely DANK. And a nice pairing with the meat.\n5. The spicy chicken sandwich: good flavors, but not our favorite. The bread's a little dry and gets in the way of how awesome the chicken is.\n\nFurthermore, if you have not, please make a visit to Memphis Minnies immediately.

What more can a girl as for besides good food and good company? \n\n..at the end of lunch, both our tummies were going to burst but it was going to burst from being filled with good BBQ. \n\nWalking in, you are hit with a quirky and color vibe and then your eyes scan around the room and notice shirts hanging on the wall and communal tables (there are small tables that seat a group of four). Oh, and you also notice the sweet smell of good ole' BBQ! When I walked in, I almost missed the menu because I was taking everything in and kept on walking. It is quite a cute place.\n\nWe ordered:\nThree Meat Plate (forgot the name..sometimes Minnie) that comes with 2 sides\nBrisket\nPork Ribs\nBeef Ribs\nSweet Potato\n& Greens\n\nTHINGS I LOVED:\nThe brisket, pork ribs, and beef ribs - all right, let's just say I loved all the meats, cause it's true. But what can I say, they were delicious, extremely delicious. The briskets were sliced thick and they were juicy with just the right amount of fat. I have had thickly sliced briskets that were extremely dry and there was none of that here. The pork ribs were fall of the bone delicious and when you took a bite, it felt like everything was right with the world. The beef ribs were perfectly charred and not dry, I feel like beef ribs are so hard to cook because they get dry easily but again, none of that dry stuff here.\n\nTHINGS THAT WERE OKAY:\nThe sweet potatoes - I didn't love them and I didn't hate them. They were pretty good and the juice reminds me of apple cider.\n\nTHINGS I DID NOT LOVE:\nThe greens, I just felt like it was soaked in vinegar and it was just not my cup of tea. Every time I took a bite and inhaled, I was hit with the taste of vinegar and I didn't really like the taste of it.\n\nSauces:\nOut of all four sauces, I found that I leaned towards the Texas Red Sauce - I wouldn't say that it is my favorite BBQ sauce of all time, but out of the four choices that I had, I would say that it goes pretty well with the meats. The reason why I didn't love it is because it was a bit too sweet for me. But overall it's not bad drenched all over the meats.", "author": "Mona L."}

Well, my uncle is pretty obsessed with the place and has become quite the regular. I live 700 miles away and I've eaten here no less than a half dozen times on as many trips to SF, so there's not much chance I'll be trying anywhere else very soon.\n\nSome observations:\n\nThe brisket is almost always very good. Occasionally it's a little dry. Sometimes it's totally sublime. Mostly it's pretty good.\n\nThe sausage is underrated. Just try it once, and you'll see.\n\nThe ribs are solid. Not socks-off sexy, but solid.\n\nThe pie is pretty dang delish. I love pie, but even in a pie town it holds up. Best served after a big BBQ meal.\n\nThe sauces are fun to have on the table, but don't get carried away. The Texas red sauce is middle of the road, the Carolina vinegar is good in small doses, and the Carolina mustard is divine. I haven't tried the hot hot insane stuff. Why do that to a perfectly good plate of BBQ?\n\nThe sides are all pretty good. They're constantly evolving and changing. The slaw isn't the creamy kind, which is a nice change. The mac 'n cheese ain't what she used to be now that it's curly curl noodles. The collard greens are the business.\n\nYou pay for your meal. It ain't the cheapest game in town, so if you're not particular about your smoked meat stacks, you'd probably be best to try somewhere else.\n\n\nDoes it redefine the BBQ scene? Nah. But in a town not known for its 'que, they're slinging some good grub that transports a little bit of Memphis across the bridge.", "author": "Jeffrey S."}

She was pretty, had a good job, soft spoken.  Sounds all good right?  After about a year I discovered she was totally wack-a-doo.  I saw signs about three months in, but I allowed myself to be blinded, probably partly my own stupidity. Anyways, she was from Memphis...\n\nA friend of mine suggested we try Minnie's since it's close to his house and he knows I like barbecue.  When I even hear the word barbecue I get a smile on my face like the Enzyte man in the commercials.  Barbecue reminds me that God loves me.  \n\nOoooh, as I walked in front of Minnie's eatery, it had the look.  Awww, how cute, a smiling piggy.  When I came in the employees were super friendly, nice guys.  It started off on the right foot just like my Ex did..\n\nA little background about me, I'm a beast when it comes to eating animals.  I don't really have a problem with the process of foie gras (Yea, I said it!)  I even like veal and suckling pig.  For those that don't know, that's baby cow and baby pig.  But I do have a problem when it is cooked wrong and doesn't taste good.  It's such a sin.  \n\nSo while Minnie's had the look and the friendly people working.  Everything I ate from the beef brisket to the ribs, the mac & cheese and yams.  It was all just wack-a-doo.  Oh yea, Minnie's is from Memphis.  \n\nSo I'm starting to see a pattern.  My experiences with Memphis have just been all bad.  \n\nSo just as I told the Ex,  Memphis Minnie's this goes for you too.  in the words of Beyonce: \n\nTo the left\nTo the left\nYou must not know bout me\nYou must not know bout me\nI could have another you by tomorrow \nSo don't you ever for a second get to thinkin\n\nYou're irreplacable", "author": "Michael L."}

Some people say it is the best in San Francisco, while some other reviewers have given it awful reviews.\n\nThe atmosphere is great for a barbecue place.  No metal trays, but still kind of a dive, and you can smell the smoke in the air (I've always wondered what the regulations are for these barbecue restaurants in an urban environment).\n\nThe menu has a really great selection, including beef ribs, tri-tip and some non-barbecue stuff like fried chicken, beef egg rolls and hot wings.\n\nBefore receiving my food, I thought the prices seemed rather expensive, but after the food arrived, it turned out to be a bit more food than other places, so that was fine.\n\nNow to the food!  I ordered the taster(3 meats, 2 sides, 1 corn bread), and got a free order of onion strings for signing up with \"thanx\":\n\n-Brisket: This impressed me the most.  Brisket is something that bay area places have difficult getting right.  This was tender and moist with a good brisket flavor.\n\n-Beef Ribs: Very tender with a good bark, but kinda dry.  Leagues ahead of the beef ribs at Sam's BBQ in San Jose,\n\n-St. Louis Pork Ribs: Same as beef ribs in that they were very tender with a good bark, but kinda dry.  I'm glad they were labeled as St. Louis style so I knew what I was getting ahead of time, but I thought it was interesting how they still had the skirt meat on the bottom(I like that meat, but I always thought it was removed for St. Louis Style ribs).\n\n-Coleslaw: As far as I could tell, it was all vinegar and no mayo, so no creaminess.  I really liked that.\n\n-Potlikker Greens: These were actually really good.  I just devoured these.  They had a good vinegary kick.  Not quite as good as the 'Smoking Pigs' version though.\n\n-Corn Bread: Basic corn bread.  Not much to say about this, they didn't stand out to me.\n\n-Onion Strings: Greasy Goodness.  'Tis hard to hate 'em when they are free.\n\n-Meat Rubs:  I actually really liked the rub they used for the meats.  It gave a good bark and it complemented the meats really well.  It was pretty herb-y.  It worked pretty well by enhancing the meat but not vastly changing the flavor profile, although it wasn't as delicious for me as the stronger rubs at the 'Smoking Pig' in San Jose or 'Emergency BBQ' in San Carlos.\n\n-Sauces: I was really happy with their variety and usage of sauces.  They serve all their meats dry and let us decide how much sauce to use.  They provide 4 different sauces to cover the basics, and yet surprisingly (which amused me), they don't provide the standard Kansas City style.  They had a East Carolina Vinegar Sauce, a South Carolina Mustard Sauce, a Texas Red Sauce & a spicy sauce. (Sorry Alabama, your white sauce ain't a basic sauce to me, you're just weird).  Each one was a pretty standard variant of its regional style.  It doesn't try and add their own flare to it like the sauces over at 'The Smoking Pig'.  Which doesn't garner it any points in my book, but it avoids a possible pitfall of a bad experiment.\n\n___________________\n\nConclusion:\nPerhaps you noticed that I did a lot of comparing to 'The Smoking Pig' in San Jose.  I thought that 'Memphis Minnies' makes very respectable barbecue for the bay area, but unfortunately 'The Smoking Pig' still beats it in my books.\n\nAfter eating here, I think the people giving the awful reviews to Memphis Minnie's are just new transplants from the South who haven't had time to adjust to their new barbecue environment in the bay area yet.(Or perhaps I'm really just missing out on Oakland's Barbecue offerings)", "author": "Jason S."}

Whatever the reason, I can only give 2 stars for the beef brisket I had. It was cut into nice thick slabs with a small smoke ring, and I was pleased to see that the meat was not overly fatty (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/memphis-minnies-san-francisco?select=cwJUgg8LIZTk9j878uAHKQ#cwJUgg8LIZTk9j878uAHKQ). However, it lacked that rich smokey flavor, and even worse, the meat was on the dry side. I found myself needing to repeatedly use the sauce - and as we like to say in the midwest, that meat should be so good it don't need no sauce...The BBQ sauces were acceptable but nothing more than that; the sweet and spicy are a bit flat on their own but they combine nicely. I'm sure the vinegar sauce would go well on pulled pork and same with the honey mustard on chicken.\n\nThe meat on its own probably warrants 2.5-3 stars but I'm dropping down to 2 for price. 1/2 lb of beef brisket is $10.95, as is a beef brisket sandwich; 1/2 slab of pork ribs is $15.25. I know Q's not the most inexpensive fare, but I'm used to a price point at least $2 cheaper than that, for even moister and smokier meat. And while it may not be fair to compare San Francisco to the midwest, where most of the living population here consists of cows and pigs, I still contend that at a $10.95-$15.95 price point you can go elsewhere in the city and get an outstanding meal...it just won't be BBQ.", "author": "Clarice W."}

I had the beef brisket, the meat itself was tender and moist but it really had me searching for flavor. I thought if I start slathering sauces on it, that would improve the taste. Four sauces were at the table: Texas Red sauce, vinegar, mustard and the \"it's stupid hot\" sauce.  The Texas Red was all sugar and I didn't care for the rest. The \"it's stupid hot\" sauce was too hot for me to handle! plus the consistency of the sauces weren't appealing, it's too thin.\n\nOn the other hand, the sides were good. Mac n cheese with big tubes of pasta covered with cheese and topped with breadcrumbs and sweet potatoes were chunky and just had the right amount of sugar and cinnamon.\n\nThe decor is really fun and very kitschy, lots of t-shirts with funnies hanging on the wall and other cute decor line the counter.

I'm the type of piggy that loves putting sloppy sauces on my meat but you will find there is no need to here. This meat can hold it's own, as is, because it is so stupidly flavorful and tender in itself. That is not to say the sauces aren't good (drink the mustard sauce, trust me). They're delightful in their own way and can be taken home for use on all your other dipping needs, whatever they may be. \nThe sides are all phenomenol (usually where bbq places neglect their attention). They also serve sake, which i never would have thought to go good with bbq but it does. \nThe staff is great and will not accept your feeble excuses as you try to explain why you had to steal seating before even ordering. Wait your turn like everyone else. \nThe music is kickass and the ambiance here is where I would want to be if I was stuck in pergatory and couldn't find my way to the light. Did I mention the stimulation of your olifactory senses? The smells permeating out of this place are orgasmic. \nThis place is my death row meal. This place is my favorite restaurant. Ever.

While the three guests' were critiquing the restaurant, their tongues were hanging out and dripping the entire time they were discussing the food...enough said.  I like BBQ so I knew I had to give it a try.\n\nSome friends were visiting, so I figured it would be the perfect time to check out the restaurant.\n\nMy wife and I ordered the St Louis ribs, beans and coleslaw.\n\nThese ribs were the best I have ever eaten.  They were cooked perfectly, had a good amount of meat and were deep with flavor and had a multitude of textures...Every bite seemed to bring out another layer.  I poured the Texas Red Sauce on them, an absolutely delicious condiment for dish.\n\nThe beans were simple, but perfectly cooked and had a depth of flavor I have never tasted from beans.  They were firm and juicy.\n\nThe slaw was delicious.  It was crunchy and vinegary with several different types of veggies added for more layers of flavor.  They were so good, I ate the entire side not thinking to save some for my wife.  Damn!  Had to go back and get more.  Wow, they were good.\n\nMy friends ordered the brisket.  I have never been a fan of brisket because it is usually dry and lacks flavor.  Brisket, to me, tends not to have much character.  This brisket was the best I have had.  It had a wonderful smokey flavor and seemed moister than brisket I have had in the past, but I wouldn't order it for myself.  I'm still not a fan of brisket.\n\nMy friends also ordered the sweet potatoes, which were outstanding.  They were firm, yet melted in my mouth.  They were buttery and sweet, but perfectly balanced.\n\nI tried the sweet tea as well.  I asked if the tea was Southern sweet or California sweet.  The woman who took our order said it was Southern sweet, but wasn't.  It was sweet, but not sugary, like the kind you find in just about every restaurant in the South.  Most sweet tea I have had in the South is absolutely disgusting.  This tea wasn't at all.  It had a nice tea flavor and was \"mildly\" sweet.  (I would like to see them offer unsweetened so I could blend them on future visits.)\n\nI really enjoyed the food at Memphis Minnie's and will try something new next time, as well as ordering more of the ribs.  They were out of this world.\n\nI highly recommend Memphis Minnie's.", "author": "David M."}

The mouthfeel was not as tender as OKJ's but good if you like your meat to have some texture without being tough or dry.  No need for sauce because the seasoning was good overall, maybe the short ends were a tad oversalted but not too offensive.  Now all they need to do is serve those ribs with some Wonderbread and a pickle.  :)  I also love the brisket and pulled pork at MM's and my friend from the deep South enjoyed their smoked fried chicken.\n\nOnly complaints: Prices are 2-3 bucks more than they ought to be ($15.25 for a half slab of ribs?!!).  Also, my one experience with the tri tip was that it was very dry, so I have avoided it ever since.  \n\nAnd last but not least, the service is always great here.

We use NO GAS and NO ELECTRIC to cook our meats.\" \n\nThis is what you want to hear. This is what we tried:\n\nTexas Beef Brisket (Smoked 18 Hours): ugly - no smoke ring - but tender and tasty and prepared nicely. (Aside: the smoke ring is more about aesthetics than actual taste - it's a myth, you know - but we also eat with our eyes).\n\nSt. Louis Style Smoked Pork Ribs: looked great, tasted just fine, but a bit dry-rub dry for my palate.\n\nSmoked Chicken: good smoked meat but also a little dry.\n\nPotlikker Greens: sweeter than I prefer, but good enough to try again.\n\nPit Smoked Beans: I can't believe I'm saying it, but the shredded pork in here was too much of a good thing (as a side) - still, very nice.\n\nCorn Bread Muffin: on the sweeter side, how I like it, but I'd rather have a couple slices of soft sliced bread (I'm old school like that).\n\nIn toto, I would've preferred more sauce options to go - all my minor dryness issues would have been mostly ignorable with more sauce.

I'm also suspicious of such a large menu. But I also wish I lived close enough to try everything.

As far as I'm concerned, this is the most tender brisket I've had in the Bay Area. I went the other night and wolfed down a half a pound of brisket along with some of their other great food. While the brisket was the standout of the meal the ribs were also really tasty. I had the corn bread and the slaw for sides, and they were both spot on. \nI really wanted dessert, but was conflicted which one to get. They had more choices for desserts than most BBQ places I've been to. So, my friend just decided to order one of each and we split them at the table. The sweet potato pie was as good as it gets. The fried peach pie was also really good, but was really hot when I first bit into it and burned my mouth a bit. The banana pudding was just as good as any other I've had and the pecan pie was also very tasty.

In fact, last time the office went out to BBQ for lunch, we went to a trendy new hipster BBQ place on Divisadero and it was not very good. After our meal, we swore that we would only eat at Memphis Minnie's because in my opinion, Memphis Minnie's consistently delivers an amazing BBQ meal. \nMemphis Minnie's has been around a long time and I think that is a testament to their quality and consistency. Julia Child even ate here! I'd bet she loved it because that lady knew good food. \n\nIf you're questioning eating here, let me tell you about some of my favorites.\n\nMemphis Sweet Smoked Pulled Pork: Juicy and piled high. SO GOOD. You don't necessarily need the sauce, but they give you FOUR sauce options to blow your mind. For the pulled pork, I prefer the Texas Red and Carolina Mustard sauces combined. Nom nom nom nom.\n\nSmoked Pork Ribs: Really tender and not fall-off-the-bone messy. So good I sometimes even suck out the bone marrow. These could easily be eaten with a sprinkle of salt and pepper, but I do love all the sauces set up as a little dipping station for these bad boys.\n\nMacaroni & Cheese: Big macaroni noodles, big cheesy flavor and breadcrumbs. Most BBQ places skip the breadcrumbs, but they add a great texture to contrast this soft and creamy side dish. Its some next-level stuff. I love it.\n\nPotato Salad: Deliciously homemade red potato salad with a bit of red bell pepper that sends this picnic and BBQ staple to the moon. I am so glad they don't do boring sides here.\n\nBBQ Seasoned Fries: Order the $4.75 basket and seriously get enough fries to feed six people or three super drunk patrons from Molotov's which is next door. These are really great fries and I don't love fries, so they impress me every time.\n\nThe service here is pretty good, but I can see how some people might get frustrated. The space isn't huge and when it is crowded, things can get kind of tense, especially when there isn't any more seating. To avoid this, I usually go for an early or late lunch to beat the crowds. You usually get better service and your choice of seating.\n\nI have been enjoying Memphis Minnie's for years, even before I lived in SF and still beats out all the other BBQ I've had in the city's limits, so if you love BBQ (and I'm sure you do!) shift it into gear and get down to Memphis Minnie's for some bone-suckin, down home flavor!", "author": "Michael T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-06-04", "description": "A friend and I came here after she promised to take me out for a belated birthday and put the longing for BBQ in my brain. However, we came here more by chance as 4505 Meats had sold out of both brisket AND ribs by 7:30 pm, Cathead BBQ was closed on Tuesdays, and Sneaky's BBQ was catering at Vinyl but with no place to sit cuz it was Trivia Night. So after having read about this place here and there, I decided we'd make our way Memphis Minnie's.\n\nWhen you walk in, you might notice how colorful this place is with all the T-shirts on the wall. The good thing is that the restaurant smells like Q. You order at the register at the far end of a high counter top separating you from the open kitchen. The service is actually quite friendly.\n\nAs is our customary habit, we opted to try as many things as possible.\n\nSauces: there are 4 sauces provided on the table. The reddish Texas sauce is the closest to store-bought BBQ sauce, but that's not saying much. It's a little sweet and tangy and worked best (in my mind) with the brisket. The mustard sauce is actually quite delicious and paired well with the ribs. The hot sauce is fairly spicy and offers a little bit of fruitiness (possibly from habaneros?) but lacked a deeper flavor (or the heat prevents you from tasting it). The vinegar sauce was our least favorite.\n\nBrisket: smoky. tender, but not completely shredded tender. A decent but not overwhelming amount of fat. Seasoning was solid. My friend's favorite of our 4 meats, my only serious complaint was that it was served only warm instead of hot (see more below).\n\nRibs: my favorite protein of the 4. Again, smoky with a flavorful, savory (not brown sugar-based) rub. A ways away from fall-off-the-bone tender, you will definitely need to bite it off. Was able to eat some of it without sauce and still enjoy it, but the mustard sauce took it to another level. Again, temperature was a factor as some pieces were more dry and might have been made worse if they were heated to just-cooked temperatures.\n\nChicken: Pretty good, again a good amount of smoke. They gave us a weird combination of thigh+breast that left me confused as to how to pick it apart. Things are starting to get a little saltier here...\n\nPork: Some parts were overburnt offering pure carbon instead of cooked meat, and boy were some parts salty. It's hard to critique much else when your taste buds alternate between charred remains and salt.\n\nCole Slaw: Non-mayo-based, it was almost like a natural rendition of KFC's cole slaw with the vegetables being shreded instead of pulverized and with slices of sweet peppers mixed in. Predominantly sweet with a light touch of vinegar, it offered a refreshing contrast to the heaviness of all that protein.\n\nMac and cheese: good, spiral noodles cooked more al dente than most places serve, not much more to say...\n\nPotato salad: It was alright, better than grocery store potato salad as it wasn't as sour...but overall somewhat bland.\n\nCornbread: solid, just a little sweet with an acceptably moist center. Good enough to want more than one.\n\nPecan Pie: alright, they do it right. The crust may be a little overdone, but large pecans and sweet ooey-gooey center makes everything else forgivable.\n\nPeach Turnovers: more like peach empanadas, they were unfortunately filled with unripe peaches! Minimal sweetness without the confection sugar and somewhat tart, we couldn't finish them and it wasn't due to a lack of stomach space.\n\nI don't know if this place doesn't have heating or they keep it shut off so that the cooks can stay cool in the open kitchen, but the 50 degree weather outside has a definite impact on dropping your food temperature really fast. If you come, sit further away from the door. I'd consider giving the pork another chance, but, pecan pie aside, this place will always be more of a fallback than a primary destination for me going forward.", "author": "Gene C."}

And delicious! Both the rib and the brisket were so tender and flavorful. Wasn't a huge fan of the bbq sauces but that's irrelevant because the  meat was amazing by itself! \n\nThe service was also outstanding. The woman that helped us was friendly and made some great recommendations. She also stopped at our table to have us try a bbq sauce that was off the menu.

Ribs ain't quite on the level of Flint's (sorry, Tom...nothing is!), but they're muy flavorful and juicy and head and shoulders above anything else you'll find in San Francisco.  As for the brisket...this might be blasphemy of a sort, but it might just be better than Flint's, especially when you get the juicy ends of the meat with its lip-smacking char.  Oh, yes, and the sauces...always on the side, but to die for:  Texas Red, South Carolina Mustard, and North Carolina Vinegar...and the restaurant's own tongue-searing, tear-inducing, flavorful heat-packing hot sauce--only a couple drops, now!\n\nI pretty much always get a Minnie's Taster of ribs, brisket and Andouille sausage to go (I'm adverse to being an absolute pig in public, which I'm wont to do with this food; besides, everything in the joint goes VERY well the several ice-cold Anchor Steams and shot of Herradura Double Barrel Reposado that generally graces my humble abode...just sayin')...but I love waiting for my order in the restaurant and listening to the delicious blues and rhythm 'n' blues and roots music that pours nonstop from the speakers while I people-watch.  Hey, it's the Lower Haight.  Always a good time.\n\nAnd that's not even mentioning the hip and happening servers, who always treat me like I've just come home for the holidays--even at my curmudgeonliest.

Case in point: Memphis Minnie's. I think it fits solidly at a 3.5 stars, so I had the age-long debate in my head on yelp: does that mean I bring it down to a 3 stars or bump it up to a 4 stars. \n\nI had to go with 3 stars because there wasn't an extra umph that helped bring it to that next level. \n\nThe atmosphere is a standard BBQ place, it's nicely located though parking can be terrible if you don;t have the SF parking god smiling on you that day. You order then sit down and they call your name. \n\nI have to say, the brisket and fried chicken - SO good!!! The brisket would practically fall apart on my fork and melt in my mouth and I felt like I was in heaven. Then when I switched to the fried chicken, it was perfectly crispy and the meat was not dry at all. Definitely get the mac and cheese as a side as it was really good. The hot sausage was pretty good. If I stopped there, I would have left feeling really good about the food here. Alas, I also got the ribs and they were not that good. Very mediocre, weren't falling off the bone tender and were rather pretty dry. I was actually looking forward to eating some yummy ribs the most so the fact that they were not that yummy was a little disappointing. \n\nPro-tip, free onion ring strings if you download the Thanx app on your smartphone.

After that, I had barbecue whenever I could, and Nate's was always the standard bearer. I was so bummed when they closed down several years ago. I visited Cat's Head but it wasn't the same. It sufficed though. \n\nThis weekend, while on tour with The Jim Henson Company, I was staying in the lower Haight and, on a whim, decided to see if there were any closer alternatives to Cat's Head. Then I discovered Memphis Minnie's. This place is amazing and I believe I have a new favorite barbecue place in San Francisco. \n\nI ordered a two meat combo, brisket and pulled pork along with cole slaw and pit beans. The brisket and pulled pork were out of this world. So good.  And the crust on both was the best I've had, and I've eaten a lot of barbecue. The sides were good, the cole slaw was great, really great flavor.   The pitt beans were good too, similar to what I've had before, but still good. \n\nI love the sauce options that Memphis Minnie's provides too. Instead of being a place that is 'only Texas style' or 'only Carolina style,' Minnie's gives you different style sauces to try and they are all great. My favorites were the Carolina Mustard and the Texas Red. \n\nFor dessert, I had a hard choice between the pecan and sweet potato pie. I went with sweet potato and it was amazing.  I'm eager to go back and try the pecan. \n\nThe staff was nice and seemed to care that you really liked the food. While I was there, two older ladies ordered and then realized that they had ordered the wrong thing. The staff had already begun to prepare their original order, but when the error was found, the customer's error mind you, the staff prepared a new plate and boxed up the first plate for the ladies to take with them. Gratis. What place does that? None that I know of. That is service. \n\nMemphis Minnie's, you have a new fan and next time I'm in town, I'll be stopping in.

I sat down to notice that there are what appear to be visitors drawings underneath the clear cover protecting the checkerboard table cloths. This made me feel welcome and tempted to contribute a little doodle myself. \n\nThe food did not take very long and they packaged it in a nice little cardboard box for us. We stopped by a liquor store to grab some white bread and were loving life inside Danny Coyles with our barbecue from Memphis Minnies. The brisket was smoked just right and the sauce combined with white bread and tecate beer had me loving life.\n\nOverall, this place is located in a very fun area and can provide a southern getaway for those homesick for some good barbecue.\n\nPros: \nQuick service\nFree refills\nFun and comfortable dining area\n\nCons:\nParking is sparse", "author": "Frankie Z."}

However, watching the Braves-Giants game last night made me nostalgic for something reminiscent of the South and I couldn't hold off any longer.\n\nI placed an order for their \"Southern Star\" sandwich with a side of mac n' cheese.  First, they should be banned from using the word southern in connection with anything on their menu.  The meat was completely dry; it was so leathery (that's what he said).  They included two sauces with the meal: a \"red sauce\" and a \"mustard sauce\" is how they were described to me.  The \"red sauce\" tasted like a tamarind chutney.  It was terrible.  Tamarind flavors should only appear in Thai and Indian cooking.  The mustard sauce tasted like diluted Grey Poupon.  I thought \"well at least I have mac n' cheese, right?\" Wrong.  The mac n' cheese was dry and tasteless.  \n\nAt least the staff was nice and friendly.  I wanted to like Memphis Minnie's, but I knew it never stood a chance.

Attempting to eat the bun for their burgers and chicken sandwiches actually makes your jaw sore and stiff after an attempt. There's got to be tons of different hamburger buns that they could use instead They also have no condiments other then cheese and grilled onions.

While I love all the other restaurants, I end up going to Memphis Minnie's more than any other place, credit to their quality food and fairly reasonable prices.  I've had BBQ at much cheaper prices, but cheaper alternatives do not come close to the level of Memphis Minnie's.  They really take their food seriously, and you could see that people here are serious about their work.  While the restaurant's name suggests they serve Memphis style barbecue, their menu consists of Texas and St. Louis style items.  \n\nEver since Minnie's became one of my favorite restaurants, I decided to made an effort to try everything on their menu, a goal I still haven't reached, but coming very close.  Note that not all items are available all the time.  ALL their dishes are good, but here is the ranking of my favorite items:\n\n1. Pastrami Sandwich (only available on Wednesdays) ($9)\n2. Memphis Sweet-Smoked Pork ($12)\n3. Texas Beef Brisket ($14)\n4. The Minnie's Burger ($8)\n5. Texas Big Beef Ribs ($14)\n6. St. Louis Style Smoked Pork Ribs ($14)\n7. Tri tip steak ($14)\n8. Rib tips ($9)\n9. Smoked Sausages ($12)\n10. Smoked Turkey Breast (may need to go on Fri/Sat/Sun) ($14) \n11. Smoked Chicken Plate ($12)\n\nSides:\n1. Tart 'n Tangy Slaw\n2. Hand cut fries\n3. Mac & Cheese\n4. Beans\n5. Sweet potatoes\n6. Potato salad\n7. Greens\n\nI recommend ordering their two-way ($15) or three-way ($17) to try a variety of their dishes.\n\nI first tried this place after it was featured in the show \"Check Please --- Bay Area.\" (you can watch all their episodes online http://www.kqed.org/weblog/food/2006/09/check-please-bay-area-season-2-episode.jsp)  \n\nSERVICE:  When I went around 7:00 PM on a Saturday night, the place was packed.  Seats are on first to order basis, which is fair.  I was impressed with their service in that the cashier kept track of when I got my seats and signaled to the cook to prepare the food; avoiding the food to cool down while the I still didn't have seats.\n\nSYSTEM:  This is one of those 'order, pay, and pickup your own food when they call your name' kind of place.  As you enter, cooking area is to the left and tables against the wall on the right.  Form a line along the left side along the kitchen counter where you could see the menu on the wall.  The guy taking the order was nice and informative and wasn't disturbed when I was asking questions.  He informed me that pork ribs, which I thought would be the thing to eat there, was actually the third most popular item on the menu.  People come here to eat Texas Beef Briskets (smoked 18 hours), followed by Texas beef ribs.  Pay immediately after ordering, get your drinks, and find a table.  The cook will call your name when the food is ready.\n\nFOOD:  I really loved their pastrami sandwich.  It's seasoned perfectly, so you don't need to slap on extra mustard.  It's a bit different than NYC style pastrami, but Minnie's makes it excellent in their own way.  I wish they offered it everyday, instead of just on Wednesdays.  Beef brisket, which was not tough at all, had a very tasty smoked taste even without any sauce.  All their food comes without sauce with three types of home made sauces available for use on the table.  The French fries were also very nice.  Cole slaw wasn't smothered in mayo and had this sweet vinegar taste.  \n\nTIP:  I saw the cook preparing to smoke their signature dishes, sweet pork and beef brisket, around 7 pm.  She told me they smoke it until 11 am next day and its best after resting it for about 2 hours.  Which means you might be able to eat their brisket at their peak around 1pm.  \n\nBURGER: You might wonder why someone would order a burger when their smoked items are so good, but frequent diners at Minnie's know that their burger could be the best burger in the city.  Don't look for lettuce, tomatoes, avocado, pickles, or mayo; they want you to enjoy the taste of their hand ground meat grilled to perfection.  Crispy charred outside, juicy inside, needs nothing more than grilled onions and cheese.  You could add ketchup or BBQ sauce, but you might want to first take a bite and notice existent flavors.  Toasted baguette keeps the juice inside and makes it a perfect bun for this kind of burger.  \n\nSUMMARY:  You can keep it under $10/person if you go with sandwiches or go with their platters which are around $14 + tax and drinks.  This may seem a bit on high side for lunch at a non-full service restaurant, but it's actually a good deal when you consider the quality of food you are getting.  For dinner, it's certainly a bargain.", "author": "\u30c8\u30e2 T."}

Before I could attempt to sketch my own, our food was ready.\n\nMy husband and I split a three-way:\n\n- Tri tip: I'm on the fence with this one. It was soft, but not juicy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-02-28", "description": "Let me preface this review with saying I have been on a hunt for decent BBQ in the Bay Area, not just my current residence of SF, but previously in the East Bay. After 9 years in the southern US on a diet steady of excellent BBQ I was about to give up hope. I stopped into Memphis Minnie's this afternoon, and I'm already planning my return. Initial impression, unassuming order at the counter type set up. No servers, no fancy vibe trying to distract from the food, this has classic hole in the wall presence; and I like it. I guess just this week they did away with combo plates/platters and the que and sides are  a-la cart. You order by 1/4, 1/2 or 1lb weights, with sides coming in small/med/large. I was very impressed to see rib tips as an option, cheap ends of pork that for BBQ fans offers great smokey chewy nuggets of meat. I went with 1/4lb of them, and 1/4lb of smoked pulled pork. They have a very extensive offering of meats, and a very comprehensive offering of sides, I went with slaw and beans (as staples of trying a new BBQ place I go with those) My name was called a few minutes later and plate of my food resting on the raised kitchen pass-through. I could tell almost immediately this was real BBQ, the rib tips with a bright pink smoke ring and the pork in beautiful clumps of meat. On the table are 4 sauces, South Carolina Mustard, Memphis, North Carolina vinegar and a super hot which is a more vinegar heavy version of the memphis. I tried a teaspoon of each, and not a single one wasn't good (which makes things tough, because which do I use??) I started with SC and started eating the rib tips by hand, it only took 2 bites to know I had found a place that can smoke meat. Tom told me they use mostly white oak and everything is pure smoke no outside heat source.... real BBQ! Pork was a little shy on smoke/bark, but I'm weird that I like the bark, most just want the moist strands of meat. The pork was the perfect dichotomy of moist/dry/flaky/clumpy..... a blend of the super hot and Memphis sauce was a nice addition. Beans..... perfectly cooked, not mushy, perfectly toothy with great smokey sweetness. Slaw was sweet vinegar based with bell pepper added. It was something different, something special and unique (which I applaud) Prices are very decent, I left feeling/looking 6 months pregnant (which is STUFFED) for $16.50+tip. They have sweet tea, that tastes like sweet tea (BTW) \n\nWrapping up this lengthy review: I have found my spot. I will be a frequent returner. This is authentic smoked BBQ, unpretentiously served and all house made sauces are pretty awesome. I wonder if I can start a tab!?!? This spot, is a bad news for a diet.", "author": "Adam S."}

A huge sign asks you not to sit before ordering.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-08-17", "description": "Holy meat galore!\n\nA long-time lover of all things meat, I was really looking forward to a meat feast at Memphis Minnie's. While it certainly hit the spot in the meat category (not only was I still full when I woke up the next morning, I was craving salad... and I am NOT a salad person), it left something to be desired in the taste department. Perhaps I'm just not a big fan of dry rubs...\n\nWhile I know that a huge part of American BBQ is the sauces, I also feel that great BBQ shouldn't rely on sauces alone. The meat itself should be so well seasoned and marinated that it renders the sauces somewhat unnecessary. This was not the case here. I found myself squirting puddle after puddle of sauces on my plate - not because I thought they were particularly amazing (though the South Caroline mustard and Texas red sauces were pretty good), but because my taste buds were yearning for more flavour.\n\nI shared a Minnie's Taster (3 meats, 2 sides, and a corn muffin) with a friend. We chose the Texas big BEEF RIBS, Memphis sweet SMOKED PORK, their famous Texas beef BRISKET, bbq seasoned FRIES and SWEET POTATOES (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VlNE3m59v836-t3V4ZaOWQ?select=jCvDnrUbN4E6Evg518rsQQ). My favourite was the smoked pork, followed by the tender brisket. The beef ribs were ok and I wonder if I would've liked the pork ribs more. To be honest, all the meats tasted the same to me - that is, they tasted like whatever sauce I doused them with. The only difference was their textures.\n\nI actually enjoyed the sides more than I did the meats. The bbq fries were delicious but extremely greasy; the majority of them were translucent (and soggy) with oil. The sweet potatoes were good, but how can you go wrong with cubed baked sweet potatoes? I also liked the sweet and sour potlikker greens. My favourite dish of the night, hands down, was the amazing MAC & CHEESE (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VlNE3m59v836-t3V4ZaOWQ?select=r977oww6RNTfhdFZrkJa1Q) that we ordered on the side. It was so much better (and cheaper!) than the mac n cheese I had at Wayfare Tavern and Bobo's recently. It was flavourful but not too saucy or rich. I just LOVED it!\n\nThe service was also great. They remembered our names and the owner even came by twice to ask us how we're doing!", "author": "Steph L."}

You have to be serious about BBQ to sit through entire courses on the subject, and you can bet your ass that these guys are. \n\nUnfortunately, I have never consumed the food sober, they are located across the street from my second home, The Toronado, so I get the food to go most of the time and make everyone inside the Toronado hungry when they smell the goodness. \n\nThe best thing on the menu is the Brisket, which I always order by the pound. However, you need to ask what part of the brisket your going to get because sometimes you get a lot of the fat cap. The sauces are mouthwatering, the tangy flavor of the Texas sauce is excellent and brings out the smokey flavor of the meat. The best side is the cornbread because the grainy texture is perfect for scooping up sauce. The mac and cheese noodles are too large and the coleslaw is mayo free so I stay away from those sides. Great place, I need to try it sober one time.", "author": "bart b."}

I love the place itself--it's almost as fun to visit as when it was Spaghetti Western back in the day.  And I love that the staff is friendly and solidly down to earth.  They all seem like interesting people.  I never feel out of place there even though I'm not a Lower Haight hipster.\n\nTheir brisket is absolutely the best.  On my first visit I was surprised to find that their meats are served unsauced, but now I love being able to try several sauces, and I love being able to eat the brisket on its own as well.  So smoky and tender, with a nice crisp edge, and OMG, yum.  It is so flavorful, it doesn't really need sauce on every bite.\n\nRecently I tried their fried chicken sandwich (Wednesday special) and it was very, very good.  It had three generous pieces of perfect fried chicken inside, topped with their slaw.  The slaw is actually pretty plain, and I loved the crunch and the tang but feel the sandwich would have been better with some mayo inside.  It was good with the vinegar sauce and the mustard sauce, so I kept switching sauces between bites to figure out which I liked better.  Verdict:  A draw.\n\nTheir sides are hit-or-miss, for me.  Some I love and some are just OK to me.  You might like different sides than me for different reasons.  One thing I wish they did is put honey and butter out for the cornbread.  That would make a big difference.  I love the bacon brittle for dessert.\n\nI've got to come back and try the pastrami on a Wednesday.", "author": "Lorelei S."}

We stood in line nevertheless and went through the menu. That kept us busy while waiting in line. We ordered the following 2 dishes:\n(a) Meat Two way combo: St. Louis Pork Ribs and Santa Maria Tri-Tip Steak Plate. It comes with 2 sides and I chose potato salad and potlikker greens\n(b) Meat Two way combo: Texas Big beef Ribs and Beef Brisket. 2 sides included Fries and Mac N Cheese\n\nThey ran out of all desserts except for the Banana Pudding so we passed.  We wanted to order th Pecan Pie. \n\nBy the time we ordered, the tables emptied so we decided to eat in and got seats right away. Then it was a wait for the food to come out. A couple right in front of us ordered To Go and they waited just as long... so there is really no shorter wait for take out. We got our food after 20 minutes or so. I must say that the food is overrated. The meats are dry and bland. We ended up pouring tons and tons of sauce (they have 3 for you to choose from) on the meats to get some flavors out of it. Quite disappointed. I've had better BBQ... but their business will probably continue to prosper because there is a niche of good ol' Southern soul food in the Bay Area.

It didn't blow me away like I thought it would (not enough to get that fifth star), but it was still very good. \n\nI decided to grab dinner here on a Friday after the gym. It wasn't that crowded (I've driven by this place when the line was literally out the door) and they were quick with my order. \n\nI decided to go the two-meat combo, which came with two sides. Now I love ribs & brisket as much as the next person, but I decided to go with the sweet pork (which I had before and knew was good) as well as the chicken. Both were excellent. I know that when it comes to BBQ, a lot of people disregard chicken (to some people it might as well be a \"vegetarian\" option), but I love BBQ chicken. The two sides I decided to go with were the seasoned fries and coleslaw (again, I know these aren't the most \"BBQ-like\" options when you also have sweet potatoes, mac & cheese, and greens to choose from, but they sounded good at the time). The fries were a little soggy, but did have good taste. I LOVED the coleslaw! It was tangy (vinegar, not mayonnaise based) and was crisp, with peppers and tomato. The meal also came with a corn muffin, which I thought was eh... \n\nThe quality of the food was good, and when I eat BBQ I expect to pay more than I would with other kinds of food, but for about $17.50 (with tax) I didn't think the portions were great (certainly no leftovers for this hungry boy).

Probably because I don't explore the entire city, but anyways this place is better than Blues BBQ except for the cornbread (Blues cornbread is so moist and just melts in your mouth...and you can totally taste the corn).\n\n My bf and I shared the 3 meat plate (which came with two sides and a cornbread) and it was definitely more than enough for the two of us for less than $20. They also serve beer, wine and saki.  The pulled pork was delicious, and so was the beef brisket, although it was  a little fatty.  The pork ribs were good but they didn't have much meat on them. Mac and cheese was good (not the best I've ever had) and the french fries were good (slightly spicy and sweet seasoning). The sweet potato side was okay (I asked how they were made, and the owner told me exactly how they make them, apple juice and all ha- i was just wondering if they were mashed - they're cubed btw). \n\nBut the owner gets extra points because he said if we didn't like the sweet potatoes that much, we could change our side. While they were cooking it, we decided to switch bc we saw another person's fries, and he gave us an extra side for free. The owner seems pretty awesome and the place just has an awesome vibe. We'll definitely be back.\n\nO- not 5 stars because although the meat was awesome for the most part, the sides were not awesome (they will still really good).

The unassuming joint in the Lower Haight serves up the tastiest brisket, tri-tip, ribs, and other fine BBQ treats in the city. Everything at Memphis Minnie's is slow smoked Southern style--no gas or electric here. All the meats are smoked at least 4 hours (some up to 18 hours) over white oak logs, lending it the authentic taste that Memphis Minnie's is known for. \n\nMemphis Minnie's is usually busy all day, which is a testament to how delicious it's smoked meats really are; however, the food comes out hot and fast. They are known for their Slow Cooked Texas Beef Brisket, but the menu also has an assortment of fine dishes if you aren't a fan of traditional brisket. Popular main dishes are the St. Louis Style Pork Ribs, Santa Maria Tri-Tip Steak Plate, Smoked Chicken Plate, and the Two Way Combo (any two meats) for those who can't make decisions. The Smokehouse Sandwiches are also an excellent choice for lunch or dinner for those with a smaller appetite. \n\nMemphis Minnie's is plain delicious. The meats are smoked to perfection, the sides are super tasty, and they even have creative desserts like the Smoked Pecan Bacon Brittle. Yum!

Ordered the two way combo that comes with two meats (smoked chicken and brisket), 2 sides (beans and seasoned fries) and a corn muffin (they left it off my order! Boo! It happens.) for takeout. \n\nThe food was prepared rather quickly, with the food and the restaurant smelling wonderfully of smoked meat. Once I opened the takeout box, the food was still pretty warm, but some of the fries were soggy from the steam built up in the container and the liquid from the beans. That's okay though, they were still tasty. The chicken is really good. Not only were the thigh and drumstick well cooked, the fat had all but melted off, leaving just a well seasoned, crispy skin. Yum! The brisket was a bit on the salty side, but otherwise very juicy and tender. The order came with a container of the mustard sauce and a container of the Texas BBQ sauce. Both were quite good and would be good on salads, veggies and even a plain broiled chicken breast. \n\nThe utensils were thrown in the container...is that their thing? I've never really seen that before and am not sure I like having it covered in food before I even have a chance to eat it (the food, that is). \n\nHaving spent a couple of years in the South and eaten my share of BBQ, I thought the food was okay, but on the pricey side.

I am a big fan of their beef ribs which are usually done to perfection.   Minnie's barbecues them (smoking them) slowly so if they haven't gotten them early, you can't get them that day -- and the supply of beef ribs is not as reliable as I would wish.  But if they don't have beef ribs, the various forms of pork ribs are wonderful, as is the Wednesday pastrami (available on Wednesday only). \n\nThe ribs are smoked dry -- without sauce, and if you believe that BBQ means sauce, you just haven't tasted Minnie's ribs -- they are wonderful without sauce - and I sometimes eat them this way.  However, on the table are bottles of four made-at-Minnies BBQ sauces: South Carolina Mustard, North Carolina Vinegar, Texas Red Sauce, and Bee Izabob's Breath Spicy Hot Sauce. Texas Red and South Carolina Mustard are my favorites.  The rib plates come with your choice of 2 sides and a corn muffin (southern style definitely and delicious).   \n\nSides include fries (thin and flavorful), greens (so this can be health food), beans (not from a can), mac and cheese, sweet potatoes, and several others I think.  My friend and I usually order two plates and thus have four sides between us ... and they are plenty big to share.  And they have onion strings which you can order a la carte or as a substitute for the two sides (or at least they let us do that when we asked).  \n\nThe food is all delicious.  It is usually big enough that I eat some for lunch and have a nice lite supper on the remains afterwards.  That is, when the flavor doesn't make me forget to stop when I'm no longer hungry.  \n\nThey have traditional soda drinks (refillable from a machine) and sweet tea that should be illegal as it is so addictive.  I know they're other things on the menu but so far I've rarely had them.\n\nHow good is Minnie's -- The food is so good that a good friend (with whom I dine about once a week) and I come here nearly twice a month.

We got there early and were lucky enough to sample everything they had: ribs, brisket, pulled pork, chicken, coleslaw, beans, collard greens, and cornbread! On the side they had three different kinds of sauces. I forgot what they were called specifically, but one was a mustard, another was the Texas Red Sauce, and the last one was a hot version of the red sauce.\n\nWhile in line, we could watch them cook up the chicken and ribs. They hacked into those chicken halves right in front of us! I'm sure these guys are pros, but it kind of scared me to see them be so forceful with a giant butcher knife!\n\nThe brisket was pretty good. I liked the outer crunch and just cut off the fatty layer. The ribs left something to be desired... I felt like it didn't have much flavor and I ended up dipping it into the Texas Red Sauce (which didn't do much for it, either). I also had a little helping of the pulled pork, which was also just okay. The chicken on the other hand was nice and moist! The juices had the right amount of flavor, no sauce needed! The coleslaw was pretty good, as were the beans, and collard greens... Nothing amazing, though. I did enjoy their cornbread. I got a piece with a dollop of their butter on top. It was crunch on the outside, but not too crumbly inside, which is exactly what I like. It was slightly buttery and sweet, but not overpowering. I'm a big fan of cornbread, and this was definitely up to par! My friend tried some of their sweet tea and seemed pretty satisfied with it, but I didn't try any.\n\nAs the crowd grew larger (who wouldn't show up for free food and free beer?), the line ended up backing up. I'm pretty sure these guys underestimated the number of employees that would show up. However, I peeked over there before I left and even though they were definitely moving quickly to get things cooking and on peoples' plates, they looked like they had things under control.\n\nI've passed by their actual restaurant in SF, but never tried it until now.

Lastly, there was the smoked pork which was a little chewier and clearly not as good as the other two meats.\n\nThe fries are super seasoned and salty and just too much. It left my mouth feeling raw after just a few so I stuck to the mac and cheese that was sort of bland but creamy and sprinkled with bread crumbs.

The atmosphere of the joint is pretty cool with wall to wall pig paraphernalia and customer drawings of none other than pigs on the tables. The staff are quick and efficient and got through the lines of people like it was nothing, so although the place may seem crowded when you go, it's usually not too long of a wait. Once you order your food, the staff are quick to see that you get a table.\n\nOn our trip, my Dad and I ordered the sausage, the rib tips, smoked pork and beef brisket. Far and away, the best meat dish there was the beef brisket. It was slow smoked and maintained a lovely, fatty richness that went well with the vinegary, chili accompaniments at the table. The other meats were simply average compared to the brisket. There was a wide range of sides to choose from including Mac and Cheese, Beans, Collared Greens, and Corn Muffins, but again, there was really nothing to write home about. Everything really seemed average and comparable to any other BBQ joint. \n\nThere aren't too many BBQ houses around the neighborhood, so its safe to say Memphis Minnie's can feed the average BBQ fix, but I'm still on a quest to find something a little bit more satisfying.", "author": "Christina N."}

A bottle of \"South Carolina Mustard Sauce\" and a bottle of delectable, sweet, smokey, burn-your-mouth-Habanero-laced BBQ sauce called \"BeezleBob's Breath\", described on the label as \"Stupid Hot\". She tells me she got these sauces from a \"bomb-ass BBQ spot in the Lower Haight called Memphis Minnies\". She visited again in December and brought the \"North Carolina Vinegar Sauce\" from this fine establishment...\n\nAlthough all 3 of these sauces are outstanding, being a \"Food Pyro\" (I love spicy sh*t) I used the \"BBB\" sauce on everything. Pork ribs, beef ribs, chicken, bacon & eggs, sandwiches... I think the kicker was during Christmas, when I marinated a top sirloin roast in it. Even though that roast was one of the last entrees out of the oven, it was the first one gone... with several victims perspiring and asking for more at the same time. \n\nSo this past weekend I finally paid a visit to the source of this infamous sauce. Needless to say, the food was DELICIOUS. I had the \"taster\", where you can order your choice of 3 meats. I opted for the Brisket, Memphis sweet smoked Pork (pulled pork) and Rib tips. I initially ordered the Tri-Tip, but at the last minute changed it up to the rib tips. For my side dishes, I got the Mac & cheese and the potato salad. It also comes with a corn bread muffin. \n\nBoth the Brisket and smoked pork were ridiculously tender... the rib tips - not so much. They weren't horrible, but lets just say I should've stuck with the Tri-Tip. My wife found a new friend in their \"Texas Red sauce\", which she doused her Pulled Pork Sandwich with. (we bought a bottle to take home) The potato salad was a perfect texture, with a little tangyness to it = delicious. The mac & cheese was creamy, cheesy and mmm, mmm good! The corn bread muffin was a little on the dry side but at that point I really didn't care! \n\nOh , I forgot to tell you that we ordered their \"Chili-cheese & Brisket Fries\". WOW. That's all I can say. Just WOW... \n\nOne thing I WISH I WOULD HAVE ORDERED: The St. Louis style Pork Ribs. My son ordered them & couldn't finish his, so... what the hell, right? After about half a swallow, I was convinced that I'm getting a whole slab the next time I go back to Memphis Minnie's. I haven't had that kind of regret since I forgot my camera that time I saw Jessica Alba in a 2 piece bikini at the Kahala Mandarin Hotel... (did I just say that out loud?) Oh well... \n\nSo, with all the praise I've just given this place, you're probably asking yourself: \"Well then why did you only give them 4 stars?\" It's simple. Portion size. Since my dish was $16.95 & included 3 items, I was thinking it would be a HUGE pile smokey BBQ... eh, it was ok. 4 slices of Brisket, about 3/4 cup of pulled pork & 4 rib tips. I hate to sound like a pig but dammit, I was hungry! Then I see some guy with a plate FULL of pork ribs... so again, it's no mystery what I'm getting next time. \n\nBottom line: Eat Here.

Everything we ordered was just delicious. \n\nWe ordered:\n-Texas Beef Briskey (smoked 18 hours!) - $15\n-Two Way Combo with pork and beef ribs - $16\n\nThey both came with 2 sides so we got the mac and cheese and corn bread. The mac and cheese was SO good!! Too bad they come in tiny little sauce cups - it's okay...portion control! The corn bread is forgettable; was kinda dry and you have to ask for butter if you want it.\n\nNote: I made the mistake of asking for a knife for the brisket. The main chef (maybe owner) left the kitchen to come to our table and give me a lengthy lecture on how disappointed he was that I asked for a knife when his brisket is super tender. Damn. Well, at least he knows I won't ever make that mistake again! Haha...all good though..we were joking about it a few minutes later.\n\nThe desserts looked incredible too: Scratch Pecan Pie, Banana Pudding, Fried Peach Pie. OMG.

So how come he's only been here a few times?\n\nMatt has been here three times to be exact, and all three times it has been on a Wednesday. For the restaurant, every Wednesday is Pastrami Wednesdays. For $8.95, you get a Pastrami sandwich with a choice of sides, and another $1.50 for a fountain soda.  The Pastrami was tender, but dry. So Matt added their original Texas Red Sauce to moisten the meat and excite the taste buds. Matt chose fries as his sides. The skinny fries were spiced really well and complimented well with the same Texas Sauce. \n\nMatt enjoyed the Texas Red Sauce so much that he paid an additional $6.50 for a bottle of his own to take home. Another favorite sauce in his condiment section like the Sriracha Hot-sauce, Tapatio Sauce and Dave's Insanity hot-sauce to name a few. As the coined-phrase goes according to Emeril Lagasse, the Texas Red Sauce would taste great on a sole of a shoe.", "author": "Matt G."}

Their sides impressively don't taste oily, but are more tart with vinegar, and definitely remind me of my visits to Memphis and Mississippi.  I had a delicious Southern Star sandwich, and appreciated that it came with two kinds of sauce on the side.  The combination of Southern home-style-ness along with CA ingredients makes Memphis Minnie's one of my two favorite BBQ places I've been to (the other is Tupelo's in Cambridge, MA).  I absolutely love barbecue sauce as a condiment, but Memphis Minnie's makes ingredients shine such that one wouldn't want to douse them in sauce.\n\nThe only down sides to the delivery experience:  they can't deliver sweet tea, and I should have mentioned over the phone that I needed a copy of the receipt since the delivery guy couldn't give me one.", "author": "Sohini R."}

Whether you choose to go here or just order in (you can easily order online from Grubhub), you are in for some good and tasty meaty eats. \n\nThey serve up fall off the bone ribs (Texas style, whatever that means) as well as a smokey, moist, and fatty (thus flavorful) beef brisket. I am partial to the beef brisket which is just sliced slabs of meat. It comes with two good dipping sauces (a BBQ style sauce and a spicy mustard sauce), but I prefer my meat just plain. I'd rather not let the flavor of the sauce overpower the taste of the meat.  \n\nThe sides here good as well. Not a huge fan of their corn bread muffin, which is too dry for my taste. But I really like the sweet potatoes here. This is the perfect sweet (and relatively healthy) complement to any BBQ dish. \n\nIt's hard to hate BBQ unless you have no soul (but you probably have bigger things to worry about like eternal damnation, but let's not go there).

The other slices looked like they had previously had the fat there, but either it was all cooked out or this was an old brisket that had been left to dry, as the meat was dry and flaky...and very much not in a good way.\n\nOther downside, is that the wait can seem to be rather long, which is a little annoying considering that most of this stuff is already cooked and done.

I really like this sandwich. Wish it had more kick. I like pulled chicken, love that bbq flavor! \n\nOh, and can't forget the potato salad between all my bites, tasted nice and light, but too vinegar-ish for my taste. I also had dry corn bread. Yes, DRY corn bread. I enjoyed my pulled spicy chicken sandwich, although it wasn't spicy at all. Whatsoever.  But I will definitely be back here again.", "author": "Kimberly H."}

The brisket was deliciously fatty, and fell right apart on the plate. The sausage was also really delicious, flavorful, and spicy. The fries were OK, kinda like the cajun fries at Five Guys, but not as good. The ribs though, were quite bland, and didn't taste like much of anything except meat (and tough meat at that).\n\nGotta give an extra star though for the service.

Memphis Minnie's truly idolizes the pig. There are pig-themed wall signs, pig-inspired napkin drawings and pig-adorned t-shirts on the walls. In other words, it's a perfect place to pig out. \n\nMy first couple of minutes at this place were pretty awkward. Here's the conversation I had with the cashier right off the bat: \n\nMemphis Minnie's Cashier: \"Welcome! Are you still deciding? You should definitely get some of our country fried chicken. It's so good, it comes with its own prescription for Lipitor.\" \nMe: \"Well, I already take Lipitor, so I won't be needing that.\" \nCashier: [awkward silence] \n\nSince I didn't come to this place to lower my cholesterol level, I decided to go all out. I went for the two-way platter with brisket and pulled pork. Reasonably priced at $15.95, the platter comes with two sides (mac 'n' cheese and sweet potatoes, please) and a cornbread muffin. I complemented the meal with a glass of Diet Coke from the fountain, paid $19.60 all told, grabbed some silverware and sat down. \n\nThe place is really small. We were here at 4 pm, and the place was empty. I bet the lines get pretty long here during the dinner rush. There are about 12 tables in the whole establishment, so they ask that you not \"save\" a table until you order your food. The tables are covered with checkered tablecloths, which, in turn, are covered with plastic protectors (similar to the ones you might find protecting your grandma's couch). I thoroughly enjoyed looking at the customer pig drawings on the napkins displayed under the plastic protector. If I could draw, I would, too, try to get my napkin on display. \n\nIt didn't take long for them to call my name to come to the counter and get my food. I got four thick slices of brisket and a decent sized serving of pulled pork. Next to the meat there were two tiny cups with the sides I ordered. The sides were embarrassingly small. Even my cornbread muffin (DEEEEEElicious, by the way) was laughing at those tiny cups. The brisket and the pulled pork were a little dry, but it was nothing a little BBQ sauce couldn't fix. There were 4 kinds of sauce on the table: vinegar sauce, mustard sauce, regular BBQ sauce and extra hot sauce. The last two were very good. My mac 'n' cheese had a weird flavor, and my sweet potatoes could have used some spice. Bland sweet potatoes are not the best thing in the world. Maybe the small sides were a blessing in disguise.

Good location, found parking pretty easily at 3:00 in the afternoon on a Wednesday. I was very glad that Wednesday happened to be their reuben sandwich special day. Delicious! Big sandwich, lots of very flavorful, melt in your mouth meat. My dining companion had their pork ribs and liked them. Neither one of us was impressed with their crispy fried onion strings - greasy and came out cold. Had their fried peach pie (two pieces) which was very good. Sweet, friendly, hip young people at the counter where you order. Definitely going back for more reubens, maybe with fries this time.

We checked out yelp and a lot of my fellow yelpers recommended Memphis Minnie's. THANK YOU!! We went down there and had some wonderful BBQ that whisked us off to the south. We ordered the beef ribs, which were ab fab. Very smokey flavor, not covered in sauce like some other places do and very authentic. I also ordered the southern star sandwich, which is half beef brisket and half smoked pork. Incredible flavors and cooked to perfection. The prices are pretty good and you get a lot of food for your buck at this spot in the lower height. I'm a huge fan and my gf and I are having dinner there this Wednesday and I am very excited!! Great BBQ in sf is hard to find, so trust me when I say this spot is a must go.\n\nUpdate to 1st review: I went this past Saturday, ordered over the phone to avoid long line & when I arrived I was told to wait at the end of the line, which defeats the purpose of ordering over the phone. I digress. It looks like Memphis Minnie's has a problem with consistency b/c in my 1st review I mentioned how wonderful they are. The 2nd experience was absolutely garbage! I ordered Texas Beef ribs and they were terrible!!!!! One large chuck of fat all the way through & very small amount of edible meat, which was a truly disgusting experience! Three ribs came with the order & I ended up tossing the last one b/c there was way too much fat & gristle for my taste. So, as much as I want to love this place I don't!!!!", "author": "Hector G."}

We made the mistake of believing some of these Yelp reviews (no offense, fellow Yelpers) and word of mouth. Supposedly, Memphis Minnie's is supposed to be good. And to be honest, it smells great when you walk by. But stop in, and the food doesn't come anywhere near the build up. We had dry brisket, greasy collard greens, watery mac n cheese, and the burger (which we read was great) was burned, over seasoned, and terrible. I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt, and hope that we went on an off night... but I can bring myself to go back inside.

We had the brisket, beef ribs, pork ribs, greens, and mac and cheese. The brisket was so fatty and delicious. Super tender and moist (but declines as it cools, so eat it when it's hot!). The beef ribs were also really good. It's hard to find beef ribs that are seasoned and cooked properly. The St. Louis style pork ribs were mediocre and bland (especially when compared to the first two meats); I think it needed some seasoning and a good dose of salt. I would pass on these next time. The greens were super vinegary, and tasted like they were cooked with the Southern Carolina mustard sauce (sidenote: this sauce would make a great salad dressing), and I ate every last bit. The mac and cheese was creamy and serious comfort food, just like God intended.\n\nThe space itself was awkward (it's definitely tight quarters!) and the kitchen, understandably, takes up the majority of the space. \n\nI'll definitely be back here.

It was such a cold night, I really came for the chili, which was just okay. Intrinsically, it was tasty -- only not all that warm nor spicy. My friend had a brisket sandwich and macaroni & cheese ... both of which I tasted and fully approve! They truly do an amazing job with the smoked meats. I wasn't too crazy about picking up my own food (not because I'm lazy, but because you literally have to reach into the chef's window like a food server would, and it was a bit precarious) and parking is a biiiiiiiitch, but the B-Q sauces are quite good (regular, spicy, vinegar-based and mustard options).

The Mac & Cheese was delicious, the Cornbread wasn't bad, the BBQ French Fries were so tasty I forgot to share, and I didn't try the 'Slaw because that junk scares me.  Does it raise a red flag if I'm terrified of mayo, but don't mind eating something that used to have a face?\n\n$33 for two very big meals, cooked quickly and devoured at little tables covered with glass and giant pourable bottles of BBQ Sauce and Mustard. \n\nOh, and before you judge my family for killing, please remember they didn't shoot animals (or people) for sport.

So you may be asking why I am giving it only two stars, well it's because of their rising prices and small side dishes.\n\nI've been coming to this place for almost five years and now my favorite dish (Southern Star) is $10.50.  $10.50!!!!  That's ridiculous.  It seems like everything has been going up in price here.  Well, that's enough of a deterrent for me.  The sandwiches have crossed the economic threshold for what me and my friends are willing to pay.\n\nMy second complaint is the small portions of their sides.  The mac and cheese side is like $5 and it's not even a cups worth.  Beans, potato salad, etc. are all served out of a cup you might expect to find ranch dressing in at a diner.  Not too mention that their pie slices are too small and the rest of the sides (which all look amazing by the way) are way too few in quantity to justify ordering any of them.  Again, I've been coming here for five years and have never once ordered any of the sides (that didn't come included with my meal) individually.  It's just a total rip off for what you get.\n\nAside from that, the BBQ itself is amazing.  The prices and portions are just getting really bad.", "author": "KC F."}

We don't RUIN the meat by slathering it in sauce.\"\n\nOh, um, thanks. Awesome. \n\nMy chicken was good - albeit slightly dry - but as I'm not a big 'sauce' gal, I was appreciative of the fact that it had tons of flavor simply from being smoked. Or whatever they do to it for 8 hours... The firecracker fries were also pretty killer. I love me some sodium, and those things had enough to keep me retaining water for a week.

My husband and I shared a pulled pork sandwich and a plate of brisket and sausage links. The brisket was really tasty and fell apart nicely, but was a little dry. The pulled pork was not that flavorful. The links were scrumptious, especially dipped in the mustard sauce, but it's pretty hard to F up links.\n\nThere are three different sauces to choose from on the table: A red sauce, a vinegar-y sauce, and a mustard sauce. I was partial to the mustard sauce. The vinegar sauce was way too thin to stick to or flavor anything.\n\nThe sides were tasty, and help this place be a three star instead of a two star establishment. The mac and cheese was my absolute favorite. It was very nutmeg-y. The beans were made with burnt ends and tasted smoky and nice. The fries tasted like fries, but were sort of short and skimpy.\n\nThe red checkered vinyl tablecloths were a little sticky, but this is, after all, a BBQ joint and everything should be just a little sticky.\n\nWell, the sauce wasn't thick enough. The fries weren't long enough. How can a place that serves up so much meat be so unsatisfying?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-01-05", "description": "Memphis Minnie's Bar-B-Que Joint & Smoke House bills itself as \"The Home of Swine Dining.\"  This could be because there's plenty of primo pork barbecued here daily (except Monday).  Or perhaps it's a fusion of \"swell\" and \"fine.\"  The slogan is Truth In Advertising either way.\n\nIf you dine in, you'll notice a banner requesting that you not take a seat until you've ordered at the register.  Then you can help yourself to self-service beverages and sit and wait for your name to be called.  Pick up your order back at the counter.  Follow the same protocol for take-out ordering, except you'll have to wait standing up.\n\nI will echo what others have said about the individual plates being pricey.  The food is excellent (see caveats below), but it's a better deal to order your meat (you don't want to be here if you're vegetarian) and sides by the pound if there are several of you.  If it's just you, go for the combination plates which let you taste two or three things.  Then you can tell your friends how much you liked it and bring them back with you to get the deal.\n\nFrom the barbecue, I like the St. Louis ribs (beef), the beef brisket, and  the Memphis pork.  The cole slaw is the kind made with vinegar.  The beans and the mac & cheese are also very good.  I haven't tried the greens.\n\nIf you like burgers, don't miss the Minnie's Maxi Burger with bacon, cheese, and the seasoned fries.\n\nMemphis Minnie's barbecues the meat dry over wood coals.  There is no sauce or rub on it when it is cooked or when it is served.  A selection of sauces is on your table (or packed with your to-go order).  Most of the sauces, while tasty, are more vinegary than the tomato-based sauce many are accustomed to.  That type of sauce is conspicuously missing here.  If that's what you like best, try the Red Sauce.  It's the closest in flavor.\n\nCaveats:  \"Street Parking in the Lower Haight\" could be the title of a horror novel by Stephen King.  Take the Muni  or take a cab, but don't take your car if you can possibly help it.  You may think your friend who said \"I'll find parking and catch up with you\" has vanished into the fog.  Seating is insufficient at peak times.  You may find yourself with a plate of mouthwatering barbecue and nowhere to sit.  Beware of the earlier closing time on Sunday.  If you come close to closing, your order will be packed to go.  Another peril of coming late is that you may wind up with the drier edges of the cuts of meat - this could give you a false impression of what Minnie's food is really like at its best.  The iced tea is \"sweet tea.\"  Diabetics and weight watchers beware.\n\nCome well before closing and consider getting it by-the-pound to go.  Then invite your friends over to your place and make them think you cooked it.", "author": "Charlie G."}

I'd have to say out of all that the pork was far and away the best (especially slathered with some Texas red sauce). The sausage was spicy and about what one would expect. The brisket was good, not great. The mac n cheese was actually really good while the beans, sweet potatoes and rib tips fell short for me. Especially the rib tips which I found pretty bland and dry. Overall I was satisfied, yet not blown away by the meal.\n\nWhile I've only had a small portion of what this place has to offer, I'd still have to say I've yet to find that ONE BBQ joint in the city that makes me wish I could move to the South, marry my cousin and spend my days playin the mouth-organ... but I know its out there.

Anyone who knows BBQ well (or has spent time with BBQ socially..you know how it goes) would tell you that folks tend to be particular regarding which sauce they like, whether they prefer brisket or pork (or chicken or turkey), and to Memphis Minnie's credit, there are plenty of options here, from the sweet to spicier, catering to regional tastes from the Carolinas to Texas and, well, all the way out here to the Bay Area.\n\nMy brisket (I am, unsurprisingly perhaps, a fan of Texas-style brisket) was a little on the dry side, but the sauce was good enough and it came served on bread that was roughly as thick as the doors of my car.

So...offI go in search of the goods to quence the ache. Yes it ached.  \n\nMemphi Minnie's it is. Found parking easily, that's a big plus for sure. It smells so good. Almost reminds me of Black's BBQ in TX (which you can order and they will ship and oh baby..it's worth it).   I decide on the pork rib, beans and potato salad.  I took it to go...which may have been a mistake, but good bbq lasts.   \n\nI get home, and the ribs are looking really dry and overcooked. So either A. they were getting rid of stuff that didn't sell or B. they really do suck at cookin' the ribs...which I just can't imagine.  I got through one rib (there were about 5 or 6, my thought was they'd be good for leftovers) and had to stop. The meat was really too dry and no amount of sauce was going to change that.  VERY DISAPPOINTING.\n\nI have to say the Beans were awesome as was the salad.

The first thing I noticed was the delicious smell of BBQ. Everything is bright and colorful at Memphis Minnie's. Tables on the right and people forming in line for food on the left. Collectibles of pigs adorn the restaurant. The menu is on a chalk board and the choices seem to be endless. I decided on the beef brisket sandie and a corn muffin. He's starving, so he orders a platter- beef brisket, sausage, mac n cheese and potato salad. I secure a table as he places our order and pays for our meal. While waiting for him, I pull out my macbook and check my email. Each table has a clear plastic table cloth and underneath are pictures drawn of pigs on napkins- very cool. There is free wireless here at Memphis Minnie's, I believe its called 'Free Web.\" He joins me at our table and I put my laptop away. Not a moment too soon and his name is called. Our order was up quickly and we were eating. The portions are huge! The beef brisket was cooked perfectly- so juicy melt in your mouth goodness. The corn muffin was oh so good! I had a bite of sausage- OMGoodness that was the BEST. The mac n cheese was okay- slightly on the sweet side (not sure why). The potato salad was exceptionally delish! \n\nBeef Brisket -------------------A-\nSausage------------------------A +\nCorn Muffin--------------------A +\nMac N Cheese---------------B\nPotato Salad-----------------A +\n\nThis place was packed, obviously a local's favorite.

I noticed a sign above the door was we were leaving it read- \"Low Fat = Low Flavor,\" lol, well written! I was stuffed so I didn't try the sweet potato pie- next time!

But she loved her sweet iced tea. Even though my buddies experience at Minnie's wasn't as delicious as mine, I'm still leaving the fifth star in memory of the dirty kitchen hipster who complimented me on my ugliest day since my Bat Mitzvah.\n\n\n\n*********update*********\n\n\n\n\nI don't get many compliments anymore. Sure I get a few from the likes of you Yelpers in email form, but actual spoken word compliments? Not so much.\n\nI used to get me some compliments. Hella compliments back in college when I didn't have an office ass and the swimming pool in the backyard of my $345 rent home insured a nice golden tan. The compliments could have been caused by the over-intoxication of drunken frat boys, pre-striped shirt era....or I may have been getting these compliments because of the short shorts I loved so much that showed just a hint of ass cheek. Whatever the reason, the compliments were nice.\n\nFast forward 5 years to moving day 2007. \n\nSammy is wearing her holy jeans, a sweatshirt I stole from my best friend (yes, if you become my friend you will no doubt lose a sweatshirt. Stealing them is my thing. Get over it), running shoes, no makeup, my hair in a ratty, thrown together bun, and the giant cystic pimple I've been regularly sporting these days. In other words, I was looking fly. \n\nFly Sammy and her parents decide to take a break from organizing her new, very own apartment, and get some grub. And of course, my wannabe hipster, Marinite parents saw Memphis Minnie's on an episode of Check Please and just haaaaad to go there.\n\nSuper duper Fly Sammy and parent patrol enter MM's and are enthusiastically greeted by a dirty real, not Marinite, hipster working behind the counter. I smile at him as we make our way to look at the menu.\n\n\"Hey, you've got a great smile,\" dirty hipster sweetheart tells me. \"I see a lot of smiles, and yours is a great one.\"\n\n\"Hehe, wow, thanks,\" says Sammy the pimple queen who hasn't been complimented since the 90s.\n\nWe order, sit, and eat. The food is fantastic by the way. My dad, who is known to repeat the same sentence over and over, such as \"Wow isn't this picturesque? Look Sam, it's so picturesque\" says about 10 times in a row that his brisket sandwich is the best thing he's ever eaten and would definitely come back here. Mac and Cheese is tasty, but kind of watery for my liking. Pulled chicken sandwich is amazing, slaw is tangy and delicious and I think mom liked her ribs.\n\n\"Hey, did you go to Denver University?\" Most beautiful dirty hipster there ever lived asked me. P.S. the sweatshirt I sold says Denver University on it.\n\n\"Um no, my friend did.\" \n\nWhich launched a whole new conversation about where he was from and how he gets excited when he sees people from Colorado, Wyoming, etc.\n\nBut the man looked at me! He looked at me a few times. And complimented me! He didn't point out my cellulite, no reference to my office ass, steered clear of bringing up my ginormous zit.

No doubt about it, MM's is the closest thing  to eating in the volunteer state that doesn't require buying a ticket or working as a roadie for Willie Nielson.\n\nIf you like Memphis style bar-b-que, everything on the menu is great (seriously, you can not go wrong). If you don't, stick to the burgers, desserts (um, Pecan Pie) or the fried catfish. I personally love their pit-smoked plates. $13 or so buys a  large serving of smoked meat (pork ribs, brisket, turkey, tri-tip,or chicken, to name a few), a corn muffin  and two of their excellent sides like pit smoked beans, Deep South Sweet Potatoes, or Tart 'n Tangy slaw. You'll leave full and very likely with enough leftovers to make a nice lunch the next day.  Expect a tab for two with beer and a split desert to be around $35.00.  You order and pick up at a counter, so service is quick and there's no pressure to tip 20%.  No pressure to tip at all, come to think of it.\n\nIn its singular acknowledgment of San Francisco, MM offers a variety of Sake, together with a good assortment of draft beers available by the glass or pitcher. Personally I don't see \"Kuru No Hana\" or \"Dewa San San\" with Canjun Andouille Sausage, but then again, I've never tried it and whoever thought of bringing this bit of the South to San Francisco obviously  has a flair for successfully mixing the incongruous that shouldn't be lightly dismissed.\n\nParking can be a little tight, but its not too bad -  its never taken me more than ten minutes to circle for a place right in front or park a few blocks down and walk, and usually much less.  Pastrami is available on Wednesdays only. In case you were worried, Memphis Minnie's is a country-music free zone.", "author": "Bill S."}

Anything else? \n(Me) Nope!\n\nOk, moving on....to the other low points..\n\n2. 25min later...I go pick up the food. I get home and those ^&(*$#@ shorted me 8 ribs (and I know this because I called before and asked how many they give you for (or call) a rack) WOW! I mean I pay $46 get 3 sides, a piece of cornbread and 2 desserts and get shorted 8 ribs! \n\n3. The crust for the pies were under cooked. Not good.\n\n4. The I guess you would call it BBQ sauce was not even close to what I would call BBQ sauce. I just could not use it and the honey mustard sauce was ok, but NOTHING special.\n\n5. The Mac & Cheese (which I ordered when I walked in to pick up the food - and oh Steve was so very happy to take my money and no way was so busy I had to be put on hold for all of 8min and hung up on) was mediocre - I could have done WAY better myself.\n\n6. The greens - WAY too sweet - almost rancidy sweet.\n\n7. Potato Salad - bland. Nothing special.\n\n\nAll in all I have to sum it up with this: \nBad service - edible food for the most part - nothing special but the meat on my ribs which gets my desire to give them a 2 - bump to a 3. I don't plan on going there ever again and can't say I could honestly recommend them to anyone.

Pig and pork stuff everywhere, which distracts you as you agonize over the wait for your food.\n\nI ordered the sweet pork, brisket, tri-tip, PORK ribs, and sausage.

I for one disagree whole hearted (get it...hearted) with this \"theory.\" I feel that the greasier and the gooier the BBQ the better for your body! It lubricates the joints, helps the blood to flow easier through said heart and generally tastes good and feels good going down.\n\nSo now having educated everyone on proper BBQ health benefits, let's talk about Memphis Minnie's. Fantasy Football draft 2007, my house Sunday August 26. I am responsible for feeding 8 guys that will be in my house talking about football. I naturally think BBQ! \nI head down to lower Haight and walk in. The gentleman behind the counter asks if he can help me and off we go....\n\nFirst off, I appreciate that they know how good there food is and that they are still happy to be serving me, not acting like I'm the lucky one for being there. I explain the situation, fantasy football draft, bunch of the fellas at the house, we need to eat. The gentleman behind that counter suggested that a pound per 2-3 people is good, so I say let's do 2 pounds per person. What about sides? \"A pint for 2-3 people usually is fine. Will we be doing a pint per person?\" \"You're god damn right we will!\" I finish my order and in ten minutes everything is in a box and they include a stack of plates, napkins and utensils.\n\n\nItems Ordered:\n\nSide\nPit Smoked Beans- Beans with beef? KILLER!\nPotlikker Greens-I love me some greens and these were off the hook!\nMinnie's Macaroni & Cheese- Like mom used to make, very good.\nCorn Bread- Once again, very very good!\n\nThe Goods\nPork Ribs-PHAT\nBeef Ribs- Good\nMemphis Sweet Pork- I wanted rub this all over my naked body it was so good\nTexas Beef Brisket- Also on the naked the body with it's goodness\nSmoked Whole Chicken- Fantastic!\n\nSauces:\nHOT-And this means hot...no f-ing around\nMustard- Very good with the pork\nBBQ- VERY NICE\nVinegar- Once again...very nice!\n\nAll in all, this was a great experience. The service was great for take out, the food tasted incredible and they were fast and helpful.\n\n\nThe next day:\nI now do realize that BBQ may possibly not be so good for the heart. I woke up this morning, gasping for air and holding my chest like Fred Sanford. Was it the BBQ, well, I won't go that far. I also had a few beers to wash said BBQ down, so, I'm not sure it's fair to point fingers.

I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with corn bread and an order of their appetizer ribs.  My buddy ordered the pulled pork and some seasoned fries.  Total came out to around $40, so not too bad for a BBQ place in SF. \n\nIf this review was just based off their pulled pork it would be 4-star worthy.  The pork was tender and the roll they put it on was great.  Butttt......the rest of the food was blah.  It was criminal how bad the ribs were.  You go to a BBQ place and expect at least passable ribs.  These were dry, tough and just plain gross.  It almost looked,felt and tasted like beef jerky.  I know ribs are hard to make but I would be embarrassed to serve these ribs to anyone I wanted to stay friends with.  I got delivery and I know the food won't be as good as eating there, but there is just no excuse for how bad these ribs were.  The cornbread was very dry as well but I'll chalk that up to getting delivery.  I wasn't the biggest fan of their sauces but I know that is more of a personal thing then anything else, my buddy seemed to really like both the basic BBQ sauce and the more mustardy BBQ sauce.  We asked for a ton of sauce on the side and they were not skimpy at all, they probably gave us 10-12 small containers of it, which was great.\n\nOne side note with customer service, I hate to pile on a restaurant when they are trying to do their best but you charge $3 for delivery (the dude rides a bike, I totally get charging money for it) but then I tipped on top of the delivery charge and when I closed the front door I hear the delivery guy say \"three bucks???\".  That kind of rubbed me the wrong way.  You want me to tip you $10 to ride your bike 8 blocks??  If the food was awesome I could overlook a little attitude, but when you deliver mediocre( at best) food, then cut the BS.  \n\nI would go back for the pulled pork in a heart beat but skip everything else that has to do with this place.  Step up your BBQ game Memphis Minnie's.  As one of the only BBQ places in SF I was hoping/wishing you guys would be my go to for some good BBQ but I guess my search continues.", "author": "Mark M."}

I've looked high and low, but finally found something decent in the Lower Haight.  \n\nOn a sunny Saturday afternoon, we wandered in with slow-cooked meat on our minds and were not disappointed.  Two of us split the platter that gives you a choice of three meats, two sides and cornbread. The folks at Minnie's are big proponents of Q paired with sake, which sounds great, but I didn't try it.  I'll give it a shot next time and update the review, but as for this venture, I can assure you that the soda fountain is fully functional and they don't balk at you taking the liberty of freely refilling.\n\nThe food is served up fast, and there is a trio of house sauces on every table.  I had the brisket, pork ribs and some other pork dish.  The brisket took the cake, but the all other meat was nearly as sweet.  The sides were a mixed bag.  The mac and cheese was sub par, and the cornbread didn't thrill me, but whatever they do to season those fries is magical.  Portions are definitely substantial and a good deal for the price.\n\nThe people behind the counter are friendly and fun, crack jokes and don't get impatient when you stand and stare at the menu board for a half-hour.  One gent was so friendly in asking if we were done that we thought he wanted our table, but it turns out, he was just offering the clear off the plates for us.\n\nI'll be honest:  this isn't Memphis and this isn't Kansas City, but it is the best BBQ I have found in the city to date.", "author": "Quinn S."}

Frankly it is rather hard to get good BBQ meats in SF, so MM must have been a shining beacon of meat-hood!

But, that said, the brisket, while a bit too fatty, was quite tasty.  Also, the baked beans were very very yummy... I would go back just for them!\n\nAs mentioned by other reviewers, the place is a mess.

But, like I said, I can't say that the ribs here are bad, just not my style.\n\nMM does have some damn good sandwiches, though. The brisket is a pleaser, in either pork or beef, and on wednesdays, they have a great pastrami sandwich special special. \n\nThe one thing that is not to be missed at MM, though, is their brunch. SO good. The french toast is ridiculous. The brisket omelet is OMFG. Brisket hash is also damn fine. The salmon croquettes are nice, but kind of over seasoned for my taste.

I can't believe that I lived in the city for almost two years, rolling past fillmore and haight all the time, and never stopped in.  After having to go back to Texas and esp. Houston for a year or so, BBQ became a staple, and now I don't see how I could survive the city without Minnie's.\n\nI'll agree that lunch specials are not all that great, but I don't care much about sides, and the place is small.  My girlfriend and I can split a pound of brisket for $13.99, just two dollars more than it would cost in Texas, but it is far more tender and lean.  In The South(tm), BBQ places are bigger and cheaper because they do volume in low-rent shacks and even sometimes cook outdoors.  So, these guys have gotta pay their rent in the haight, and we all knew we were going to lose a few square feet when moving from the South - esp Texas - to the bay area, that apparently includes the BBQ joints.\n\nI like the meat at Minnie's with and without sauce, their Texas Red is pretty good but honestly, they could stand to pick up a case of Stubb's from Austin, which is available here in the city at Whole Foods (hint, hint).  As so many BBQ connoisseur will say, and you may read on some newspaper articles on the tables, it's not about the sauce, it's about the meat, and Minnie's do a good job.  For one, also, if you like to go low carb, sauce is not so great for you, but brisket, grilled chicken, etc.. fit the bill right off the fire.\n\nAs to those who knew what to expect and did not like it, I say give 'em another try.

In a typical moment of San Francisco naivete, we walked into Suppenkuche at 8:30 on a Friday, hungry as all get-out and thinking we could get seated in a reasonable timeframe.  Nope, 1-hour wait.  So now what?  Well, we were gonna go drinking in Lower Haight anyway, so let's hit up Rosamunde's.  Uh-oh, that's got a line out the door, and obviously nowhere to sit.  Hmm.  So I called my lifeline Random J and he recommends Memphis Minnie's.  We take a look in: free tables galore!  What's more, the food was ready in literally 30 seconds.\n\nMake no mistake: this is not the be-all-end-all of BBQ.  In particular, the ribs aren't as moist and tender as they ought to be.  Fortunately there's a ton of interesting sauces you can pour on them to mitigate this, including a spectacular South Carolina mustard sauce.  Another complaint is the tantalizingly small portions of sides.  The mac & cheese and baked beans will definitely leave you hankering for more.\n\nIt's the beverages that really set this place apart, though.  First off, you've got the sweet iced tea.  This was called out in SF mag's Best Of list last month, and it totally earns it.  Ah, iced tea...my old standby at restaurants, until the day I turned 21.  Finally a good reason to start drinking it again.  And then there's the Sake.  Like most people who walk in here, I thought, \"BBQ & Sake?\".  Indeed, they have a board which purports to explain how this works, but it doesn't.  So...I'll order Sake with BBQ just as soon as someone here actually explains to me why I should.  I mean, yes, I like irony, but I'm not daft.\n\nOverall, I'm torn between 4 and 5 stars.  I definitely plan to be back, which usually means 5 stars, but there's obvious room for improvement, so 4 stars it is.  In the meantime I'll roll on out to Johnson's to continue my quest for a suitable SF alternative to Uncle Frank's ridiculously good ribs & brisket down in Mountain View.", "author": "Wes M."}

Yum!\n\nWhat's not missing is Minnie's apparent disregard for good tastes. Im shocked that im saying this, but their ribs resemble the shit found Nate's BBQ: underseasoned, overcooked, hidden by a cataract of their \"famous\" bbq sauce. While it's presumptuous to assume that a bbq house, known for their brisket, serves ribs that fall off the bone, but given the amount of money and hype surrounding minnie's, i expected -- at the very least -- for the ribs to be juicy. Juicy? nope. More like yucky.\n\nThe briskets, however, wasn't as bad as the ribs. Kinda tender, kinda juicy, but way too little in proportions for the amount you're spending. 16 dollars for a dinner? With two measly sides? uh, thanks for ripping me off!\n\nAnd, oh, the sides!

So with all the glowing Yelp reviews, I entered Minnies like a shrine.  I really wanted to like this place.  \n\nI rate BBQ on two things- pork ribs in a nod to the south, and brisket out of respect for the Texan's contribution to the culinary art of 'que.  I threw in some chicken because we're on the west coast here and we can call any meat BBQ.  All were decent, none were outstanding.\n\nThe ribs:  perfect texture, they were succulent and fall off the bone tender.  They had been cooked to absolute perfection.  Unfortunately, they weren't flavored to perfection.  The taste of the smoke came out nicely, but Minnie's needs to do a better job with their rub.  It just didn't penetrate the meat enough to tickle my taste buds.\n\nThe brisket:  disappointing, especially after reading that Gourment magazine once called this brisket the best in the state.  The smoke ring (a pink ring just inside the surface area of the meat, it's formed by the smoking process and  indicates great smoke flavor) was too thin.  The flavor of the smokiness shone through pretty well and the outer edges were charred nicely, but the brisket meat was dry.  Brisket is hard to cook well, but Minnie's has a reputation and I don't feel like I should be getting dry meat there.\n\nThe sauce:  Like all great BBQ joints- Minnie's serves the sauce on the side to showcase the flavor of the meat and allow you to decide how much to add.  I added because the bland pork and dry brisket demanded it.  The traditional sauce was well balanced between the vinegar and the sugar.  The mustard sauce was the bomb!  I smeared it on everything, including...\n\nThe chicken:  surprisingly my favorite dish here.  Well cooked, and a great herb-based rub.  \n\nMinnie's was alright but I was surprised that it has garnered such a following.

Because of this, it's nearly impossible to get a seat--forget about waiting in the restaurant, there's barely a place to stand. Long, long lines!  Insanely drunk foreigners walked away with my food before it was delivered to me, and the waiter offered to remake my food since the freaks manhandled it.  \"uh, yes please?\"\n\nMeat was definitely on the fatty and dry side(oddly enough), but that was ameliorated by copious amounts of their Texas Red sauce.  The sweet tea was great, but they ran out after one glass, and an overly surly and just-plain annoying waiter said \"There's no way I'm going to go through 3 more gallons of sweet tea in 45 minutes\" and refused to give me any more (free refills, ha!).  Still thirsty, I tried three more taps (Coke, Sprite, and Root beer) and they too were out.  \n\nThe restaurant had a definite ambiance, however, I think they felt that in order to get an authentic BBQ house experience, they needed plenty of filth as well.

Since I had already planted the seed of Rosamunde's in the brain of my boyfriend, I felt bad even looking at Memphis Minnie's from the car window because I knew that the first words out of my mouth were going to be something like \"Hmm ... I've never been to Memphis Minnie's before.  Have you?\"  And then I knew he'd suggest we try it if I really wanted to, then we'd have a six minute conversation about which place we should go to ... then we'd end up going to Rosamunde's anyway since that was the plan.\n\nWe went to Rosamunde's and Toronado and inhaled sausage and sucked down pomegranate cider like they were going out of style.  So damn good!  \n\nThen...\n\nAfter Rosamunde's as we were walking back to the car, I asked if he'd wait a sec while I ran up to peer at the menu.  No problem, he said.  Took me a while, so he walked over to the menu to join me.  I then asked if he'd wait a sec while I ran inside to take a look and maybe get a side of macaroni and cheese for a snack later on.  No problem, he said and joined me inside.  \n\nWhen it was my turn at the register, I had to ask about the pastrami sandwich since it happened to be the ONE day per week that they serve it.  The guy said I HAD to get it.  Even though the Rosamunde sausage I had just inhaled a couple minutes before still was working its way down to my stomach, I ordered the pastrami sandwich with a side of macaroni and cheese to go.  \n\nAfter a few minutes of waiting, my meal was ready to go.  I was eager to get home so I could have a taste before everything got cold.  Funny thing is, not one whiff of pastrami or cheese or anything leaked from the bag into the car.  The food didn't smell like anything.  I just figured they did a good job of packing it or something, but when I got home and opened it ... I needed a microscope to locate the slivers of beef (very bland ... didn't even taste like pastrami) hidden between the large pieces of bread.  My macaroni noodles were bloated (although a nice curly shape that I liked), and the sauce was flavorless.  The sauces that they included for me to taste were unlike any BBQ sauce that I've ever had.  Very thin and \"raw\" ... like they needed to be boiled or something to enrich the flavor and thicken up.\n\nThey people who work here were very nice, and it seems that they have a loyal following.  I can't believe that everything they serve is as disappointing as their pastrami was.  Perhaps I should have ordered the ribs despite what the counter guy recommended?\n\nTwo stars.

Just on the food alone I can give this place 4 stars for their BBQ.  The ribs were a bit tough but they still tasted good.  The meat that left the biggest impression on me though was the brisket.  Easily the best brisket I have tasted and I've had BBQ in Kansas City, Atlanta, Austin, and have even attended the National BBQ Championships in Washington DC 3 times.  Someone mentioned to me that if I thought the brisket was good I should make it a point to go early and try their bacon.  My mouth is watering just thinking about how good their bacon tastes.\r\n\r\nI finally ate at Memphis Minnie's for brunch yesterday.  I know that I should have probably tried something that I hadn't eaten already but I couldn't pass up the beef brisket in hash form with two poached eggs and a cornbread biscuit.  I got a side of bacon too!  The brisket has some serious flavor going on.  It's just unreal how much flavor is packed into each bite.  I can't imagine any sane person putting any kind of sauce on the brisket.  With some nice poached eggs on top they are just that much better.  The cornbread was pretty damn good too.   Now the bacon was just great.  This was some real meaty and flavor packed bacon.  It wasn't a slinky strip of fat with tiny meat bits attached.\r\n\r\nOne thing to consider is that they don't have a whole lot of seating so you either want to get there before the crowd comes in or take it home.  Being that I live in the East Bay I'm going to have to make sure I get here early when I come for brunch.  Oh, they have house cured and smoked pastrami on Wednesdays, if I remember correctly.

This go around, I opted for the smoked turkey, which was VERY GOOD.\n\nI think that starting off with quality meat, good aging, bbq-ing technique and ultimately, seasoning and sauce makes ALL the difference when it comes to making tasty southern bbq.  I like that this restaurant  give you CHOICES in what to put on your meat.  My favorite, OF COURSE, is the NC BBQ sauce.  This is what I grew up with.  \n\nOverall, I've been pleased.  I was raised in North Carolina and it takes a LOT to impress me with regards to BBQ.  So, the fact that there is a resto in SF that even offers me an option for some \"down home Southern cookin'\" and for some Que is great.\n\nI haven't been there with enough frequency b/c SF has so many dining options, but I think that this has been a solid place from the two times that I've been there.\n\nI went there with 3 other people (including my boyfriend) and I think that we were all pleased.  \n\nThe bill came out to be around $55 for 4 people w/o tip.  P.S.  Seating can be limited, parking in the area is hard to find, and it can be a long wait if you come around 7-8PM.  They do allow take out orders and Credit Cards are accepted.", "author": "Hiromi N."}

I had seen them on Check Please Bay Area and was excited to hear all the great reviews. I'm a BBQ lover and seek out the best BBQ whenever I can. And since this place is only a few blocks from where I live, even better. Unfortunately, I didn't like it. \n\nFrom the start, I was greeted at the register where you place your order by some dreary guy who seemed miserable and talked like a slow robot. That aside, I ordered my BBQ pork sandwich with coleslaw; I like to put the coleslaw on the sandwich itself. When my order was called I picked up my sandwich. \n\nThe initial appearance looked fine. The bread was probably the best part of the sandwich though. I was quickly disappointed to see that the slaw was vinegar based; I really love the mayo versions better on my sandwich. That aside, the sandwich was served dry so you could choose from 4 sauces that were on the table. I thought that was pretty cool and quickly did a sampling of all four. Unfortunately, I didn't really like them. \n\nThe vinegar based sauce was too wet and just tasted like vinegar. The mustard sauce tasted just like runny generic yellow mustard. And the weirdest one was their standard red BBQ sauce. It was a bit too sweet but even weirder, it had this odd taste of curry! I couldn't really pin point the spice, but it had very aromatic undertones of curry. It was not good! \n\nSo how can you enjoy a BBQ pork sandwich without a good sauce! And with the vinegar cole slaw I just did not enjoy it. I was really torn to get the brisket. It may be better, but the sauces will still suck. Maybe I'll order it to go and use my better BBQ sauces at home.", "author": "Philip D."}

They were one of the branches of excellent Korean style grill \"Hibachi\" (Note: Hibachi is a Japanese word, but the business is run by Koreans. They serve awesome food that isn't available in elsewhere.) \n\nWhen I noticed that \"Hibach\" was gone, I said to myself \"Competition level of eateries in this area must be too high\". So when I walked in Memphis Minnie's, my expectation for their BBQ was more than descent. I had a reason to believe there must have been a note-worthy quality and special preparation behind each item they served. Otherwise, how could they knock \"Hibachi\" out of the block for good? Well, I was in it for a rude awakening. \n\nFor the first time, I dumped my BBQ into a trash bag without going for a second bite. As repeatedly mentioned here by many viewers, ribs was dry, tasteless, cold, and the smell of disgusting fat, instead of savory smell of properly smoked meat, reminded me of a bad cooking procedures. I will not go back to Memphis Minnie's again until they invite a real pit master from a Southern State to reintroduce to them the way to cook BBQ. \n\nFood was very bad and unacceptable, so I did not look into other criteria. \nI still do not understand what made good place go bankrupt and sub-standard neighbor live on.

Do you know what city you're in or did a tornado carry you here while you were sleeping?  \n\nI was raised mostly on Texas style BBQ, and this is different to be sure, but still very good and not exorbitantly priced in my opinion.\n\nThis is San Francisco by the way, so just give thanks that you found some familiar cuisine, (on Haight of all places) and try to enjoy your ribs or what have you.  I don't eat pork, but everything I do eat here (beef ribs, brisket, chicken etc.) is really pretty excellent.  \n\nIt's also nice that you can get a pitcher of beer as well as a flight of sake with your meal.  They have some very tasty varieties and the sake BBQ thing is actually quite delicious.  Just another unique, very un-southern characteristic of this distinctly Californicated BBQ joint.   \n\nYes, the sauces are a bit weird.  So are some of the sides, but the cornbread and sweet potatoes are great.  I don't care much for fries, but theirs are interesting.  The banana pudding, which I generally don't care for at all, is incredible there.\n\nOh, and they'll sell you one rib too.  They won't pour some soda into your hands or break a hundred, but they will sell you just one rib.\n\nI have enjoyed several regional variations of \"authentic\" BBQ, and while this place is definitely non-traditional, I think it still qualifies since the meat is smoked and slow cooked.  It isn't like they bake their ribs or anything.  \n\nThink about it this way; what would I do if I found a falafel cart in the middle of  Dixieland?  Complain because the hummus is too dry and my pita has sesame seeds on it?  \n\nIt's a fucking falafel in Dixieland.\n\nTell you what, if you're nice, I'll fry you up a catfish sandwich at my apartment just up the block.  I'll use an \"authentic\" southern catfish.\n\nIt's a Jewish catfish sandwich though, so it comes with swiss on marbled rye with a kosher dill and a pickled tomato.  \n\nPlus you get your choice of egg, potato or macaroni salad as a side.", "author": "Hebrew K."}

How is it possible for such a dry rib to have meat that falls right off the bone being the biggest one?\n\nI'd almost have to dub this the Reggie Jackson of BBQ places. It swings big, and that means when it connects the ball goes a long way. And when it misses, it falls flat on its face. Unfortunately, what it missed most on when my girlfriend and I went was the meat. The ribs were tender, but very dry, and the flavor was okay but not the best. The brisket was a little dry as well. The cornbread was so overcooked that it was nearly inedible, and the Mac and Cheese didn't have any cheese taste to it, and quite frankly the baked beans were just baked beans.\n\nThere were redeeming factors though--the fries, the banana pudding and the sauces. I made the mistake of ordering a large fries. I say mistake because my girlfriend and I were sad that we couldn't even finish half of them. The seasoning on top was great. And I don't think it would've been possible for me to eat the banana pudding faster. The sauces were the real key, as they almost singlehandedly saved the meat. If they could've covered up the texture and the dryness a little more, this rating may have been higher.\n\nAll in all, I probably will go back if I'm in the City.

At over $8 with tax, this is a modestly sized meal. I agree with others that the side dishes are small, considering ala carte purchases are over $3.  I was disappointed that the sandwich was cold, that the chicken wasn't marinated in BBQ sauce and that there was a mayonnaise like spread on the inside. I couldn't detect any heat in my spicy chicken.

I went to school in the South and drove to every state south of the Mason-Dixon line (and ate something in every single one), so I am a bit particular about my ribs.  Ribs, like most meats, come in three varieties.  Bad, Very Good, and Freakin' Incredible.  There is really no 'mediocre' ribs.\n\nMemphis Minnie's had the right interior decor for a good rib place, namely a bunch of artifacts from other ribs places, but the lack of a proper open flame over or cooker was the first sign that this was not proper BBQ.  I ordered the smoked pork ribs and waited for my meal to come out.\n\nWhen it came out, I was a little disappointed from the get go.  The ribs were dry and sauceless, which is fine for slow cooked and spice rubbed Southern (Carolina) style ribs, but the meat fell off the bone like saucy and more quickly cooked Northern (Carolina) style ribs.  The three sauces on offer, a tiny red BBQ sauce of sorts, an uninspiring mustard sauce, and a simple vinegar sauce did their best to add some zing to the affair, but over all I was left unimpressed.\n\nIf anything, great ribs should leave you looking like a mess, no matter how careful you are.  Northern style ribs soak you in sauce, Southern style ribs coat you with the spice rub.  These ribs just left a hint of grease on my fingers.\n\nSo while the meat was not great, the sides were alright.  The mac and cheese was good enough, as was the potato salad.  The sweet potatoes really didn't do much for me though because there really wasn't much that went into their preparation, served neither candied nor with brown sugar.\n\nOver all, two stars.  One for trying, the other for the decor.  None for the food.", "author": "Eric M."}

In all the BBQ meats tasted all right, but it just wasn't as good as the hype was.\n\nThe three of us each got the two-way combo for $14.95 or $16.22 after tax (choice of two meats, two sides, and a corn bread muffin.)\n\nThey had three sauces: a red bbq, a mustard sauce, and a vinegar base.

It tasted only a bit sweet, and not really smokey.\n\nBeef beef brisket: moist and great beef flavor, but not really a smoke/bbq flavor. Nice thin layer of fat on top for juice. I needed to add sauce to it to make it to my liking.\n\nAndouille sausage: good sausage! It had a bit of spice to it so it had good flavor and texture.\n\nSmoked chicken: smokiness is there, but I found the meat quite dry.\n\n+ Sides\n\nFries: Wow these were tasty! They gave us a mountain of them and they were really well-seasoned. Crispy and not swimming in oil either.\n\nMacaroni & Cheese: swimming in cheese sauce, and super rich, not exactly appetizing, but more of a guilty pleasure.\n\nBaked Beans: pretty standard, tasted how they are supposed to\n\nPotato Salad: Good mix of eggs and mayo and other veges to go with the red potatoes. Consistency was there, but it tasted like regular potato salad.\n\nCollared Greens: I'm not sure if they were supposed to be this way, but the greens tasted pickled, and were too tangy with vinegar to consume. We didn't eat much of it.\n\nColeslaw: too tangy and too sweet. This isn't coleslaw made with mayo. It's made with vinegar so it was wet, sweet, and sour. Didn't finish this either.\n\n+ Conclusion\n\nThey didn't really screw up on anything, but it wasn't really awesome either. The sauces there are too sweet or too tangy for my liking.

We were the first people in the restaurant, so our food was fresh outta the smoker.  I only get brisket at BBQ places and this brisket did not disappoint.  This is legit BBQ, unlike Bo's where they put the \"east bay twist\" on it.  The brisket had a delicious pink smoke ring and a pretty thick layer of fat that kept the meat moist.  You have a choice of the three sauces on the side (S. Carolina mustard, N. Carolina vinegar and Texas red) and they're at the table, so you can put as little or as much on as you'd like.  \n\nI also got the two sides of beans and mac n' cheese.  The beans were to DIE for.  Baked with pieces of brisket (and I'm sure cooked in fat or drippings), these beans were super tasty.  The mac n' cheese wasn't mindblowing, but the thick Velveeta-style sauces was pretty good.  Add a cornbread muffin, and the whole plate was delicious!  The bf had a side of coleslaw and couldn't eat more than a couple bites since it tasted like cucumber vinegar salad.  Gross.  Skip that one for sure.  \n\nThe one downfall that took this down to 4 stars was the guy behind the counter.  He had a chip on his shoulder and acted like we had just stepped into BBQ heaven.  Everything seemed like a chore to him and he had an attitude that you don't expect to find at any restaurant, let alone a laid-back BBQ joint.  \n\nThe place itself was pretty kitschy with pigs and t-shirts and awards all over.

Howevah, the superior taste of the sweet Texas Red Sauce (Rick refers to) remains apparent.  Their sweet texas red sauce has punch, depth, smoothiness and a very subtle heat-- the components of great bbq sauce.  Not to be mistaken for the orangey (Kansas?) sauce (they supply orange & sweet red sauces for your ribs) that needs to cut back about 1/3 of vinegar-- way too astringent.  \n\nAnother miss: though my heart palpitates at the site of the phrase \"handcut fries,\"  MM's bbq fries were a downer.  First, I wish I knew they were SHOESTRING fries 'cause unless it's sweet potato shoestrings, McDonald's or \"pomme frites\"-- I don't believe in shoestring fries.

If it were, I'd be growing in all the wrong places I'm afraid as I absolutely love barbecue and the southern variety side dishes they prepare.\n\nI had the pork ribs, and no knife was needed as the meat came right off. It has a good taste ... but I tossed on the mustard barbecue sauce here and there to sharpen it a bit. The beans were wonderful .. not sure what flavoring is in there, but I knew I wanted more of 'em.  Spiced up french fries were also a delight.  The one disappointment on the plate was a cornbread muffin ... I'm still waiting to find cornbread on the west coast that's worth a dang.\n\nI didn't have any when I visited, but there seems to be quite the selection of sake to help wash down the pork at Memphis Minnie's.\n\nThere's an overload of pig memorabilia in display cases and barbecue restaurant t-shirts on the walls.

I have gone here at least three times. I feel like I went to a slot machine and on the first pull won a jackpot - so even though I don't always win, I still come back and play this slot machine. \n\nThe first time I went here I fell in love. I came with a large group and we got to try almost all the entree on the menu - and it was all good. The meat fell off the bones of the ribs, the sausage was smoky and salty delicious, the brisket was soft and had a great sauce, the chicken was also fall of the bone tender and so tasty, everything - good. The sides were a mixed blessing but who cared after those great main dishes. \n\nI went back with a different group and it was good, but not as great as the first time. Also, no ribs, they all ran out. \n\nNext time, we did have the ribs but it was dry! The brisket was also dry and the sausage...dry (how is this possible?!?)! Now, when the entrees aren't as good, you start to notice the sides. I love mac and cheese and gain much pleasure in trying new mac and cheeses. Minnie's is wet. I'm not sure if this is a southern thing or what, but I don't like it. This was runny almost soupy mac and cheese. Yuck, I want cheesy gooey yummy cheese with cheese flavor on every piece of pasta. Not liquid cheese soup with pasta in it. Potato salad was average. \n\nSo here are am with dry food and average sides. What was the saving grace for this meal. 1. alcohol. 2. the sauces on the table. With the sauces, even though th meat was dry it was a salvageable with the sauces on the table. \n\nDon't expect to sit down. We went on at 3PM on a Sunday and still had to wait. And by the time we left there was a line out the door. The workers are super cool though and won't let anyone sit down with out ordering first. They have crazy eagle eyes that WILL know if you're trying to grab a seat ahead of your turn. If you're against communal seating, I suggest you do take out. I like this since I like to talk to my stranger neighbors (stranger as in someone I have never met, not stranger as is more strange).\n\nBreak down (break down do-wap do-wap):\nFood: 3-5 depending on what day you catch it \nAtmosphere: 2 hard to get a seat but once you do, enjoy it, talk to your neighbor and see what they like. My last neighbor loved her collard greens - I might try it next time\nPrice: 3 It's more than I'd like to pay for BBQ but when it's good it's a bargain. When it's bad, it's not worth it. Regardless always worth the gamble. \n\nFinal: 2.75 (I weigh food higher than the others) -3.75 So a solid 3.25 stars. But could be as good as a 3.75 stars! \n\nOK enough math.\n\nOh!

I wish the portions were a little bigger, because it's good and I want more of it. \n\nMy biggest gripe is the sauces. Memphis Minnie's offers a choice of 3 sauces on the tables. A mustardy sauce, a vinegary sauce, and a more typical bbq sauce. I'm generally skeptical of self-lubricating barbecue situations, but I wish Memphis Minnie's tried harder in the sauce department. The sauces are not only self-serve (which means the meat is not sauced on arrival) but also they're merely adequate.

It seems like they don't spice it up and marinate it long enough before putting it on the pit. The pork ribs I had last night weren't falling-off-the-bone tender like I like 'em, and I've been disappointed in the brisket in the past.\n\nI really, really like the fried catfish, but they're out of it 50% of the time that I try to order it. Sheesh, last night they were out of half the items on the menu. Admittedly, we did waltz in 15 minutes before closing.\n\nAnd the greens. Why oh why do I keep ordering the greens? There's 2 camps when it comes to flavoring greens. One is the vinegar camp, and the other is the pork product camp (bacon, salt pork, ham hock, etc.). I fall solidly into the latter. I keep a big hunk of salt pork in my freezer just for making giant pots of excellent greens. Sadly, Memphis Minnie's is way in the vinegar camp. It's pretty much like eating a cup of vinegar.\n\nThe beans I had last night were awful. Seems like they hadn't been soaked or cooked long enough, and they were crunchy. At least they threw some pork into the pot for those, though.\n\nThey have a new sauce, called \"It's Stupid Hot Sauce\" or something which was really good and REALLY spicy. It salvaged my pork ribs.\n\nThe service is friendly.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-08-13", "description": "Update: After a recent visit I've decided to upgrade the rating to 3 stars. Probably spurred on as much by my lack of good BBQ as anything else. The meat was good, it was smoked properly and had a very generous smoke ring, but it still failed to deliver the succulent tenderness that I'm used to. Still, my ratings criteria is a bit stricter than most. If this place was in Kansas City I'd never have given a second thought to coming back. Their sauces are still their weakest link and part of this seems almost intentional given how the owner is diametrically opposed to my own fierce loyalties as a strong proponent of dry BBQ. Even if you take it to go and put your own sauce on it at home it's just not quite up to the standards or really good BBQ.\n\nMediocre, but perhaps given the environment it might top out at average. So add a star if you're West coast born and raised, but if you're from a place that knows how to do BBQ right and have strong opinions about the proper way to do it then, well, this probably isn't for you.\n\nPersonally the biggest problem for me is that I'm from Kansas City and they just didn't offer an appropriate sauce. All three sauces available are strong vinegar sauces and reflect more of a focus on Carolina style (both mustard and a light tomato sauce are available) bbq than Memphis style. The \"Texas style\" sauce seemed a bit off , but then I've never been as familiar with Texas sauces. What was totally lacking, though, was a thick, rich molasses-laden sauce of the type that really speaks to me as barbecue and without this, well... it just wasn't right.\n\nThe meat itself didn't really live up to much of anything with the ribs failing to be fall-apart tender and without a lot of flavor on their own.\n\nIf you're in the Lower Haight and really need some bbq then maybe stop in and give them a try, but if not... well, it's not worth crossing the city for and it's probably not worth a second trip.", "author": "Mark S."}

Boy, were we hungry when we arrived.\n\nI had the 2 way combo plate, meat # 1 was the St Louis ribs (nice smoke pinkness, very tasty with a combo of their regular Texas BBQ sauce which has a heavy spice content and a healthy dash of their HOT sauce), meat # 2 was the Beef Brisket, this was OMG good and I had plenty but I didn't share this moist and smoky meat.

The outside of Minnie's fits right in with the neighborhood. \n\nMinnie's is small inside but that's cool for BBQ.  The first thing I noticed was how uninviting the guy behind the counter was. I mean the guy was like Joe Friday...no smile, no personality...just the facts. I'm used to walking into restaurants and being greeted with at least a little warmth. \n\nBut anyway onto the BBQ. My friend's hooked a up a couple of appetizer's:BBQ Seasoned Fries and the Beef Brisket Chili. I've got to give it to them for creativity. And the food was pretty good.  Not a complaint from anyone.\n\nBy the time our 4th arrived and we got ready to order the main dishes, a much friendlier guy was working the counter and he recommended the beef brisket. Of course we obliged! We also through in some Smoked Pork RIbs, and Combo plates to get a good tasting of as much as possible.\n\nI have to say the meat was seasoned well and cooked practically to perfection(i.e. moist, tender and not dry). They offer 3 different sauces: one was a tangy mustard type sauce, I think a second one was either KC or St. Louis style and I honestly don't remember the third. They weren't bad just nothing memorable. \n\nAll in all I'd definitely return for another try but I wouldn't go out of my way for a second visit.", "author": "Kevin J."}

A brisket plate with two tiny side dishes shouldn't be costing $17, but that must be the protocol for having an eatery in the lower Haight. Wasn't bad but it definitely didn't meet my standards. The raunchy cashier chick was funny, but that didn't make up for the average food. I'll go back if someone else is buying, so basically I probably won't be back.", "author": "Sherry G."}

They were out of their supposedly 'famous' brisket, out of fries. I got the smoked pork sandwich (I was in a pulled pork mood, but no pulled pork on the menu) w/ mac n' cheese. I don't know why people rave about the mac n' cheese here so much, i thought it was nasTAY, give me kraft's \"the cheesiest\" over minnie's slop (and it did resemble actual slop) anytime. Or maybe it was the fact that I sat at the table facing the bathroom which didn't help make eating any more appetizing... So, lesson here: Don't sit at the tables near the bathroom (the 2 in the back). But when I was there (about 9:40p? on a Tuesday) the place was packed and there was no other choice.\r\n\r\nThe smoked pork sandwich itself was ok, but i had to spit out some gristly parts. I was urged by friends not to make up my mind about this place until I try the brisket. But I know of much better bbq's in the bay area & probably will not go back unless i'm in the neighborhood again & everywhere else is closed. On the plus side, I do like how you get a choice of 3 sauces, in bottles at your table - allowed me to try all 3, alternating between different bites.", "author": "Andrew C."}

We asked what they recommended, and they suggested the brisket, pulled pork and ribs. \n\nThe brisket was fantastic.  Tender, lean, and good rich smoke flavor (I would find it dry for a sandwich, but on the platter it's perfect).  The ribs are simple, and I suspect the slight dryness comes from 1. not being boiled and 2. not being heavily fatted.  As someone who generally doesn't do ribs because I don't like the soggy, fatty texture, I appreciated these.  The pulled pork was a bit too on the dry side for me, but still enjoyable with some sauce (which we mixed together to create one we liked).  \n\nFor sides we had sweet potatoes and mac n' cheese.  The sweet potatoes were cooked to just the right firmness.  I preferred the ones on the top of the dish because they had less contact with the sweet base.  The mac n' cheese was solid, cheesy, with a slight cornmeal texture that I started to really dig after the first bite.  \n\nThe platter was enough to feed the two of us.

There is no hiding of flavor behind a plateful of sauce, if your looking for that try Big Nates or the other place on Grove and Divisadero.\n\nTHE BEEF IS BY FAR THE BEST IN SF., smoked to perfection, very tender and usually cut correctly which is against the grain. However I have had it there once cut incorrectly and probably because the meat cutters are from south of the border (that's how they cut meat down there).\n\nThe pork ribs seem to be hit and miss, but the last time I had them they were off-the-hook (great). Sometimes they don't have that burnt flesh on them and are also a little tough. The pulled pork is done to perfection and the chicken is just so so. The links are andouille which are really not traditional barbeque and tough. I don't eat beef ribs, but my friends say they are great here. \n\nWith both good and bad here the only reason I cannot give them more than 3 stars is the sides and the sauce. The mac n cheese is okay, but the rest are just BLAH and needs to be overhauled. The last time I tried the greens (about 8 yrs ago) they actually put barbeque sauce in them...YUK!...and the sauce sucks...YUK x 2.\n\nAs most barbeque joints go the service is slow, even if you have phoned in, but overall its good eats if you appreciate smoked meats and are not looking for a sauce drenched dinner.\n\nIf you are a sugarholic, try the sweet tea, it's sweeeeeeeet! And they have an eclectic selection of throwback sodas made with PURE CANE SUGAR! But I guess you can only appreciate cane sugar drinks if you're over 40yrs old. So just so you newborns understand the deal, don't get excited because it's NOT cocaine, it's white granulated sugar that soda was made with when it was called soda pop.

So I was listening to T Bone Walker yesterday afternoon, and had a desire to eat some BBQ, who would have figured that?  I looked on Yelp for the best BBQ in town, and this is what they gave me.  It was PACKED.  They had a sake obsession, so I got some beer.  The food took a while, but that's only because there were so many people there before us.  I got the St. Louis style ribs with slaw and sweet potatos.  The slaw was not very good, I can't even describe why.  I think this is entirely subjective (obviously), but there was one shread of cabbage in it.  Weird.  The sweet potatoes tasted like apple sauce (bonus!), and the rib tips were chewy (sign of too-fast cooking), but the rib parts were delicious.  \n\nI'm not giving it 5 because I had to wait, the cole slaw, and the tips of my ribs.

Normally to properly slow cook pork it is cooked in a low oven 12-24 hours (the really good stuff is cooked 24 hours).  This cooks off the fat (which pork shoulder is full of) and flavors the meat.  The pork shoulder they serve here is cooked maybe 3 hours.  It is full of fat, is tough, and has no flavor, (no wait, it tastes like undercooked pork shoulder which tastes like crap unless you drown it in their sauce in which case it will taste like -- surprise -- their sauce).

It's just your regular bbq shack with different \"stupid\" hot sauces on the table. It's a little on the pricey side for that kind of food. The cashier was pretty friendly and nice and I also liked the fact that they served sweet tea there (even though I can just brew some up myself at home). The sweet tea has this nostalgic taste that brings me back home to Mississippi so I like to drink it every once in a while. Also, there's lots of cool piggie decor to look at while you're smacking away and licking your fingers.  So feel free to add your personal touch of piggie artwork to the restaurant's collection. Oh and I thought it was weird that this \"soul food\" joint served Sake too.\n\nNow, on to the food -- I got the fried catfish, tartar sauce, corn muffin and bbq seasoned fries. It also comes with coleslaw, which didn't quite appeal to me so I didn't end up touching it. I thought the corn muffin was a little on the dry side with a butter after taste that I'm not used to. I prefer my cornbread to have the right slight crunch on the outside, moist inside and a little sweet and I add the butter myself. The bbq seasoned fries were tasty, but I kept burping up that taste so that wasn't too good. Haha. The catfish was just okay.. I wouldn't get it again like I normally would at other Southern restaurants. The breading tasted like there were some sort of sand crystals in there. I don't know how else to describe it. Like there's speckles of something super hard in the batter and I can hear noises from my teeth grinding into it. Does anybody know what the heck I am talking about?! \n\nMy other two buddies got some pork ribs, beef brisket & mac cheese. I think if I ever came back to this spot, I would give them ribs a try. They looked pretty moist and you can add those tangy/spicy sauces on it.\n\nThat's all folks!", "author": "Stephanie M."}

Their sides are actually odd rather than good.  Greens are far too vinegary and the mac and cheese is just plain weird.  The BBQ food itself is middling at best and recent visits were suprisingly too dry if you do not use the sauce, which is a killer for those of us who like dry rub ribs.  Either they're having heat/moisture issues with their smokers or the food is not very fresh.  Either way, anyone with time and grill can do better at home.\n\nI've been going here quite awhile and it just seems like the focus has drifted over the last several years.

Well, I can't believe this place has evaded me all these years.  Its some fine ass rib-nibblin' authentic barbeque, right down to the tattooed, snaggle-toothed employees behind the counter.  Better than Brother in Law's, and you don't even need to strap on your glock or wear a bullet-proof.  What's also different about this place is that its really a fusion of Southern and Texas barbeques - two totally distinct styles.  For example, where else could I have ordered a \"two-way combo platter\" with smoked beef brisket and cowboy beans perched next to pulled pork and collard greens?!  I pushed the sides aside and headed straight for the smoked meats which eventually melded all together becoming a plate of tender, succulent diced critter swirling in tangy red sauce.  YEEEEEHAW!  (credit cards accepted with ID.)\r\n\r\nUpdate: I just tried the beef ribs.  These are the ONLY real Texas beef ribs I have EVER had outside the State of Texas.  Bravo!!! And the banana pudding is awesome too.\r\n\r\nUpdate: I hope I'm just in a bad dream.  Last night I went to dinner here and got my usual ribs and brisket.  This is the second time in a row that the ribs seemed of a slightly lower quality meat than when I first came here a few months ago.  I hope they haven't switched distributors and I just got the rare bad rib.\r\n\r\nupdate: hmmmmm. not sure what's going on here. I suspect that they have changed to a different distributor for their ribs.  The quality seems to have dropped off a bit. The ribs are coming out tough.  However, the beef brisket is still top notch, so I will continue to go there.  Also, try the sweet potatoes in an apple sauce broth.", "author": "Rick H."}

I cruised over to Minnie's and waited about 20 minutes in the line that was out the door. Since the place was so crowded I opted to just take my food to go and enjoy it at home.\n\nSince the kitchen is up front I spent my entire time in line drooling over the food that was being made. HUGE racks of ribs were getting smoked up and chopped  and by the time I got to the register I was dying. I ordered the Southern Star which is a beef brisket AND pulled pork sandwich with a side of mac and cheese and an order of their BBQ seasoned fries. The food only took about 10 minutes to be prepared and was reasonably priced. At first bite I was slightly disappointed by the bread used - more of a baguette texture than anything but too chewy, not crisp enough. The meat however was unbelievably tender and flavorful and the two homemade sauces on the side - texas red bbq and mustard sauce were delish. Mac and cheese was also very good, kind of creamy. The fries are hand cut and are very good but they were unbelievably over seasoned to the point where I couldn't even eat them after a few bites.\n\nOverall Minnie's is a cool spot to grab some tasty bbq. I'm not sure I'd recommend running over here if you're visiting SF but it's definitely a great local spot.\n\nUpdate: Just wanted to let you guys know I got a harassing message from a newly created Yelp account about this review.

I have been here so many times I have literally had everything on the menu and have not found anything I would not order agan, although admittedly I am not a fries person.  I have brought several others who think they had found the best Q in this area and have converted them all.  Any bbq place can do ribs but if you want to test a place try their pulled pork and brisket.  Memphis Minnies shines with everything on the menu being extremely strong.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-06-06", "description": "Ever since i moved to the Bay Area from Texas about a year ago i have been on a steady search for a decent BBQ place for when im feeling homesick. The first place i tried, Uncle Frank's in Mountain View, remains my favorite, but this place is definitely seconds (haven't tried Bo's yet).\n\nMy GF and i were planning on going to Bo's last friday night but she got home late and there was no way we were going to make the hour long drive and get there before they closed. With my heart set on having BBQ i remembered reading about Memphis Minnie's and looked them up. They're open till 10, so we hopped in the car and headed up to the City. \n\nThe place was much smaller than i was expecting. Its also pretty kitschy. It doesn't feel like the best texas BBQ joints which are usually out in the middle of nowhere and involve a large woman who calls everyone 'baby', large slabs of meat served on butcher paper (no plates), and a roll of paper towels at ever table. This place feels like it would fit in pretty well in Austin though. And the t-shirts and other memorabilia from some of my favorite BBQ joints back home indicate that they know their history.\n\nSo how was the food?\n\nWe started with the rib appetizer. The ribs were okay, but certainly not the best i've had. They were a little dry (i like wet ribs) and weren't quite fall-off-the-bone tender. Luckily they have 3 sauces to help the dry ribs problem.\n\nAh yes, the three sauces. They do a vinegar based Carolina sauce that was good, but i can't really compare it because i haven't had authentic Carolina vinegar sauce. Next up is the mustard based Carolina sauce that was definitely the star of this trio. Not quite authentic but delicious in its own way. Last up with the tomato based Texas sauce. It was good but a little bit off. Texas sauce is traditionally sweetened with brown sugar (or sometimes honey), not white sugar. While there was brown sugar in the ingredients listed on the bottle, it was definitely sweetened with mostly white sugar. Also, Texas sauce traditionally has much more heat than this. Throw in some crushed red pepper and you might be on to something. See Uncle Franks for a great tomato based sauce with some heat.\n\nNext up we got the pork sandwich with BBQ seasoned fries. The pork was okay but also dry. I loaded it up with the mustard based sauce and it turned out okay, but i feel like i make better BBQ pork sandwiches at home. The fries were pretty incredible though. \n\nLast up was the brisket. With mac and cheese (the GF has a thing for mac and cheese), collard greens, and a corn muffin. Holy crap, the brisket was incredible and after everything else being pretty mediocre caught me completely by surprise. Next time i come here im only getting brisket. It really needs no sauce but a touch of the Texas sauce sets things off just right. I'm pretty unusual in that i am a Texan who loves pork BBQ (thats a Tennessee, Georgia, Kansas, Carolina thing), but i agree with most that brisket is really the way to test a bbq place. It starts out as a tough, fatty, truly disgusting cut of meat, and anyone that can turn it into something delicious knows what they're doing. This was good brisket. The mac and cheese was good but not great. The collard greens were fantastic though. I didn't know anyone was cooking collard greens in the Bay Area. Wes was right though that the sides are ridiculously small. The cornbread muffin was also a bit dry and not sweet enough for my taste.\n\nSpeaking of bread, i know that if there is one place in this glorious country where wheat bread is giving white bread a thrashing, its right here in the Bay Area. You guys (and myself included) love that super dense 9 grain stuff that could kill someone if dropped on their head. I continue to be amazed and you guys' inability to eat white bread with BBQ. Look, i don't think i've had a sandwich on wonder bread since i was in 3rd grade. I love my wheat bread. When it comes to sandwiches for lunch, or toast for breakfast i turn end to a grouch if i get stuck with white bread. But somehow with BBQ it just works. Nothing soaks up that sauce and washing things down like a slice of wonder bread. Why is that so hard? Im not asking you to eat wonderbread all the time, just with BBQ. You can't get cancer from eating like 3 or 4 times a year. Plus you're eating BBQ, are you really going to try and monitor what you're putting into your body? Wheat bread or french baguettes just don't have the right texture. Its got to be white bread.\n\nI'm not really sure whats up with the sake and would advise people to stay away. I see how maybe the flavor contrast would work but it just feels wrong. Instead go for the sweet tea, a southern staple. Its not the best sweet tea, but its not bad for being served out here. \n\nThey make good sauces at Minnie's, but they should get over their fear of putting them on the meat. I'll be coming back, but at the moment Uncle Franks is still the king of Bay Area BBQ", "author": "Travis D."}

I just reviewed B's and wrote plenty about the good and bad points about Minnie's, so I'll make this a little quicker.\n\nI saw Bob Kantor's name on the guest signbook at Snow's in Lexington, TX the very same day I went--it's too bad I didn't get the chance to shake his hand.  \n\nThe brisket at Minnie's is the best in San Francisco.  The meat and the dry rub are excellent.  It's as good as a commercial smoker can produce.  Sometimes the brisket can be a hair dry, but it's usually fantastic: flavorful and moist.\n\nThe sausage at Minnie's is also the best in San Francisco.  I can't stand links, and the andouille is actually reasonably similar to the sausage cooked in Texas.  No complaints: it's the best around.\n\nThe ribs are also good, though I prefer B's.  B's have the perfect rub and the meat just tastes better.  Minnie's ribs can be a little dry.  Baby Blues also has good ribs, but B's wins in this category.  \n\nThe sides at Minnie's are excellent--the mac & cheese, fries, and cornbread are all very good.  Big win for Minnie's.  The sauce is also very good, especially the yellow mustard stuff.  Very distinctive and goes well with the meats and sides.\n\nNow to the major downside at Minnie's: the intangibles.  More specifically, it's very difficult to get a meal there.  They have no takeout register--which means that if you call in in advance, you still might stand in an absurdly long line to get your food, which is just unacceptable.  It's even more unacceptable considering there's no parking at all in the Lower Haight, which inevitably means you have to park illegally to pick up your food (and then risk geting towed for a half hour while you wait in line).  There's no delivery option either, so these problems can be especially troublesome.  The cashiers can also be annoyingly dismissive, the space is pretty cramped and the service just stinks.  A word to the wise at Minnie's: the difference between you and the #2 in the city (the just-opened B's) is now very small.  This is when service becomes a higher priority.  Yesterday I had a decision to make between Minnie's and B's and I chose B's because the food is excellent, it's easier to park/pick up and the owner cares about his customers.", "author": "Damien W."}

The place is pretty poppin as soon as you step foot in the door, I was introduced to someone's back as there was a long line to the cashier.  And the place wasn't very large, so the amount of people that can be seated was pretty minimal.  One thing I did like about the place was how the guy behind the counter will basically yell out to get your queue to a table, and the customers there were pretty nice about following the rules.\n\nI ordered the Texas Beef Brisket with side order of mac n cheese and potato salad.  The sides were very average... I think I've made better mac n cheese and their potato salad, while better than the mac n cheese, was very typical.  The brisket was pretty good, though very dry eating it straight up.  They had these bottles of various BBQ sauces that you can add to the meat, and I think that's the only way to eat the meat here.  I drenched that sucker with the Texas Red Sauce and it made it infinitely better.  It wasn't very spicy, but it did good.  I was able to finish off most of everything on the plate, but I don't know why this place didn't leave a better taste in my mouth.

The sides are good and my one tinny criticism if I have to have one is that the fries are ever-so slightly a tiny bit on heavy side of salty. The flavor of fries with garlic and crispiness are great. I don't like boring  McDonalds=type fries. So I will keep this small. This is one of THE BEST PLACES for barbecue. Price is very reasonable considering what quality of food is, and portions are on the larger side as well.", "author": "Jeff V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2007-06-01", "description": "I'm a regular here, which in light of my following review, either makes me very patient or just a glutton for punishment.  (I'll explain that part at the end.)  In sum: dining at Memphis Minnies is a very inconsistent, very uneven experience.  More often than not, it's just not very good.\n\nAt its best, this place deserves all the superlatives you'll see in the other reviews.  Seriously.  Its brisket, when the brisket has just been roasted, is succulent and wonderful.  The fatty exterior of the cut is charred just right, sealing in the juices.  Similarly, when the sweet-pulled pork is just ready, it's a moist mound of fine barbecue.  The ribs--I'm less a fan of the ribs here, and have fewer good things to say about these-- but that said, when they're done right, others seem to like them.\n\nThe problem is that they're rarely done just right.  You never do get the barbecue here at the peak of perfection.  That legendary brisket--purportedly slow roasted for 18 hours--is, at the time you're ordering, roasted for a whole lot longer than that.  And by the time you get it, it's usually quite dry.  I won't exaggerate and say that it has the consistency of beef jerkey, but it sure looks like beef jerkey--and that is *not* an exaggeration.  And dry brisket, by the way, is not very appetizing (and annoyingly flaky).  \n\nAnd the same goes for their pork, and their ribs, and their tri-tip.  \n\nAnd forget about trying to get a truthful heads-up from the college-aged help behind the counter.  Ask them how their barbecue is that day, and they've got an answer that'll make Ol' Memphis Minnie herself proud: \"it's great.\"  The help is, well, no help at all.\n\nAnyway, I'm a regular at this restaurant because I live around the corner from the place.  This is, for me, one of few neighborhood joints that I go to when I don't feel like cooking, which is often.  So, I've been to this place many, many times (easily more than 20x, probably less than 50x), and I have a strong basis for my opinion.  So take my word for whatever you think it's worth.\n\nThe Bay Area's got a decent amount of barbecue places (mostly in Oakland, but one or two in the city as well), many of which are quite good and very consistent.  If you're looking for good barbecue, go elsewhere.\n\n(One thing: If you must go, and I know it's not cool to do this, but I really do recommend asking to see the cut of meat that you're ordering.  You can tell right away if something's been in the smoker too long.  Also, if the guys behind the counter pull out your ribs and they're wrapped in aluminum foil--which I've seen more often than I can count--just cancel your order and run to Rosamunde's across the street.)\n\nRosamunde's is good all the time.", "author": "Donovan X."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-06-09", "description": "I'm very disappointed. This place has a lot of hype, and I just wasn't impressed. I guess I was expecting something like TJ Robinson's Gingerbread House-quality eating experience and it just was a major fail. I split a Memphis Sweet-Smoked Pork, which was adequate, but dry. Sauce helped, but none of the sauces stood out. The Red sauce had a Thai-Vietnamese-Teriyaki taste that was more strange than delicious, the yellow mustard sauce was also underwhelming. Those two were the most tolerable of the four sauces offered, and every time I tried one, I was convinced that the other sauce might redeem itself. And it didn't. So the meat was dry and the sauces were weird/untasty (and thin/runny). We ordered beans and potato salad for the sides, and our plate came with corn bread. The corn bread was good, if not spectacular. The pieces of meat in the beans were a lovely surprise, and the beans were actually pretty good. I'm not a beans person, and I don't generally appreciate beans, but I have to admit they were very flavorful. The potato salad was fine. I had a sweet tea with my meal-- which tasted strangely fermented in a weird way. Nothing I ate here was amazing, and everything was quite pricey. The portion size of the sides are small. I plan on giving this place another try in the future. Maybe their fried chicken sandwich or beef brisket will blow my mind. I hope so. I lied to my bf about how I felt about the place because I didn't want to hurt his feelings. He seemed to enjoy the food very much. The cooks were very friendly, and the waitresses are very young, loud, and flirtatious. Maybe I should come back to this place when I'm not PMS-ing.", "author": "Christine S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-05-15", "description": "You can't help but to notice the little red building with its windows ablaze and the cartoon like sign featuring a jolly chef toque adorned porker. We actually came across it as if by mistake. After being smacked in the nose by the aroma of wood smoked meat we frantically looked around wondering where the intoxicating BBQ smells were coming from.\n\nWhen you enter you find yourself transported instantly to the Deep South. The smell of barbecue is heavy in the air and there is row of tables occupied by a wide variety of patrons clearly enjoying their meals. There is a small pie case that displays some of the regional desserts, the sauces that they make, and some piggy influenced chachkis, which can be found all around the restaurant.\n\nAt first I found the menu board to be a bit complicated. I don't mean to say I didn't understand what the items on it were; I wasn't sure why some of the items were on it. I guess when I really think about it one item kept distracting me; Premium Sake. As it turns out I am not the first to point out that Sake and barbecue are an odd combination. Their official position on the sake is that there are similarities in the long standing traditions and artisanal approach to both, and besides, the Sake tastes great and so does the barbecue so together they are doubly good. Ok, I'll buy that. Some people drink red wine with fish and white wine with beef, and some people will drink Sake with barbecue.\n\nSince we just happened to end up at Memphis Minnie's and this was not a planned review I was a bit unprepared to order the variety of foods that I would for a typical menu sampling. Since I was with a couple of other people I just let them know that I would be eating off their plates for the sake of the review. They hesitantly agreed.\n\nI ordered the Minnie's Taster; three meats with a choice of two sides. On my plate will be the Texas Big Bones, the 18hour Smoked Texas Brisket, and the Memphis Sweet Smoked Pork. Accompanying those meats will be the Potlikker Greens and the Tart 'n Tangy Slaw. In addition to those I will also be sampling the St. Louis Smoked Pork Ribs. I really had my mind set on the Andouille sausage, alas there was none. In all fairness it does say \"Not All Items Are Available All The Time\" right on the menu board.\n\nI prefer to start with the sides, let's get the supporting cast out of the way so that we can get to the main event. The slaw is crispy and tangy. There are slivers of red onion and bell pepper which compliment the shredded salad. This is not your typical California creamy mayo slaw. The dressing is on this is vinegar based and has a distinct twang to it. There is a sweetness that follows as your taste buds snap back, but it is well balanced and not sugary.\n\nThe Potlikker Greens are prepared in a classic down south manner, with onion and vinegar and slow cooked tender greens. I found these to be quite delicious but a little sweeter than I like. I did put about half of them down before the sweetness got to me.\n\nCenter stage was a battle for the best and quite honestly I find it almost impossible to pick the best of these incredible smoked delicacies. The beef ribs are rich and dark with a zesty bark. The meat comes away from the bones cleanly and they are the most tender beef ribs I have ever experienced. Next, the pork shoulder, buttery soft and smoky with just the right amount of spices. The outside pieces are sweet and sticky from the slow cooking process. No knives are needed here. The beef brisket was juicy and tender. The flavors were mesmerizing and the texture was perfect. There was a quarter inch smoke ring on the tender beef slices. The St. Louis Ribs also came away from the bone cleanly. The outside was crusted with spices and slightly charred meat while inside; the tender pork, pink from smoke was juicy and sweet. I struggled with the idea of putting sauce on this perfectly cooked meat but the variety of sauces on the table was intriguing.\n\nOn the table were three sauces Red, Vinegar, and Mustard sauce. First the Texas Red; Bold, tangy, and sweet, the flavor of ginger and clove stood out. The North Carolina Vinegar Sauce is tangy but not sour. I think the word vinegar in the name of this sauce is a bit misleading. It is fresh and herbal and really wakes up the meat you sprinkle it on. South Carolina mustard sauce is a just little sweet and has a delicate nature. It is a perfect accompaniment for the any of the pork dishes. All of the sauces were balanced and enhanced the meats. They were delicate enough to let the meats natural flavors come through, yet bold enough to stand up to the rich smoky meats that they adorn.\n\nIn Northern California where you find barbecue restaurants with no pits, and heavily sauced meats cooked in ovens, Memphis Minnie's is a whole new world; like walking through a portal to a land where barbecue matters. The meats are perfectly prepared and the sauce is optional if needed at all.", "author": "Ron L."}

Three everyday, off the street type of people who apply to be on the program are invited to share their view about their favorite restaurant.  Each of the other two also patronize the restaurant and give their critiques.  The program is quite informative as the restaurants range from greasy spoons to some pretty upscale places.  Another feature of the show I like is they tell you what to expect to spend per person without drinks.  \n\nMemphis Minnie's received rave reviews so I was disappointed when the food didn't blow me away.  I ordered the St. Louis rib plate which included a sweet corn bread muffin and two sides.  I chose the potlicker greens and the southern sweet potatoes.  The greens were good and the sweet potatoes were ok.  The skimpiness of the portions bothered me somewhat.  The sides amounted to about two tablespoons worth and there were about 4 or 5 ribs on the plate without the tips.  The tips are offered as a separate cut.  The ribs were fairly tasty but a little too dry for my taste.  The meat would just about fall off the bone before you could get it into your mouth.  Minnie's does make excellent sauces which are abundantly available on each table.  My wife had the tri-tip sandwhich.  Interestingly enough, the only thing on her plate was a tri-tip sandwhich, no fries, no cole slaw, nothing.  You would think at $8.95 they would at least put some fries and an ice cream scoop of slaw on the plate.\n\nEver since this place was featured on \"Check Please\" the place has been jammed.

I've tried the place a few times and have always found their meat overcooked to the point of mushiness.  I agree that it's probably perfect for a two-year old, but I prefer more consistency to my meat than Gerber's.\n\nAdditionally, I have not had a good side dish there yet.  The macaroni and cheese is mediocre, the \"southern\" sweet potatoes laughably bad, and the cole slaw only acceptable.\n\nOh, yes, Memphis Minnie's does offer a small variety of barbecue sauces.

What most of us (on the West Coast at least) consider BBQ at home is in fact called grilling which is a different concept (unless you are getting into Santa Maria style than that's a whole other deal).\n\nSo yeah I take my BBQ seriously....\n\nI hadn't been to this place in forever but after feeling a certain grumbling in my gut followed by a sign (ok I was thumbing through Details and I saw huge pornographic pics of meat--the dead coming from animal kind, not the other kind of meat that Details would be prone to show) I realized I had to go out my quest. After a nice stroll I found myself here with partner in crime John H. I remembered the brisket being quite good and that it was! Rich smoky flavor in every soft yummy bite and I was fortunate enough to have gotten it at just the right level of dryness sans sauce. The Memphis style pork that John H got was equally good in terms of richness but not as lean as my brisket (but pork fat tastes so fricken good! Hey I'm a Yelper, it's kind of assumed if you eat meat and you Yelp, you eat bacon. Think about it.) The mac and cheese was surprisingly just as hefty on my belly as my sandwich. If I had had ANY room in my pooch left I would have filled it with their banana pudding concoction.   \n\nKey notes though: This is tough to eat after a night of hard drinking. \n\nAfter all the food is consumed, for the rest of the day, when you burp you will be tasting your meal here.

Easily the best BBQ I have found in CA.  Everything had deep smoke flavor without being over-bearing.  They use CA Oak wood.  IMHO oak is best for Texas-style BBQ.  The beef ribs were both crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  Had to chew around the membrane, but no big deal.  The brisket was really excellent, deep smoke ring but tender and moist.  Not as good as the best joints in Texas (Louie Mueller is my benchmark) but still pretty damn good.  The pork ribs were tender and tasty.  The sides were wonderful.  Never tried greens before, but they were wonderful with both sweet and tangy vinegar notes.  Pit beans were equally good and much less sweet than most versions and had some vinegar kick.

This is the variety of sauce I am accustomed to, and prefer it over any other. The other two sauces seemed less sharp, and one bordered on downright sweet.  Barbecue is quite literally  a matter of taste, and in large part depends on whether you are a 1) meat person, or a 2) sauce person.  Memphis Minnies seems to deliver on either count.

I tried the beef brisket and smoked sausage and the beef was for the most part tender, although the ends of the slices were very dried out.  The sausage was a bit spicy for me but had a good flavor.  The fries were pretty good...freshly cut and \"barbecue\" seasoned with a sugary tint.  The macaroni was an interesting combination of cheese and cornbread.  You get a choice of three barbecue sauces at your table (North Carolina vinegar, red hot sauce and mustard something) and i tried the red sauce.  I felt it was lacking a bit in flavor and it was a bit on the watery side and cold (a bit cooler than room temp), which didn't work well with my hot meat.  I was a little annoyed that the water dispenser that kept giving me pink water and I was also a little disturbed by the alternating honky tonk and zydeco music playing overhead.  Sorry the zydeco just didn't fit with the barbecue to me.  Where are they supposed to be hailing from?  Memphis, Texas, or Louisiana? The servers were nice enough and my food came up in 2 minutes literally.  The meat was good, but I've had a lot better, but this is San Francisco, so ok, I may have to lower my expectations a bit.  (I'm originally from Texas and went to college for 5 years in Memphis if you're wondering).  Like I said a strong 3 rating, but I'm open to changing my rating for better or worse when I go back and try the fried catfish and ribs and try some more sides.\n\n11/5 Update:  Gonna have to knock this one down to a 2.  I've visited 7 times now since I live in the neighborhood and my experiences have been going downhill in quality ever since.  I still think the catfish is tasty, but I ordered a barbecue sandwich this past time and the bread was wrong for the sandwich, the meat was cold, and the barbecue sauces on the side were cold.  Why oh why would you ever serve someone cold meat and cold barbecue sauce, or hot meat and cold barbecue sauce?", "author": "LaSha G."}

Tender, sweet, flavorful meat with a smoky bark on it.  No other place in the bay area comes close to their pulled pork.  Their brisket is good, and he smokes it for 18 hours.  The ribs are great one day and ok the next.  The skinny fries are seasoned and are another highlight here. The pecan pie was sweet and crunchy.  They serve saki?  One of my favorites is the Southern Star,  a french roll with pork on one side and brisket on the other. They also have deep fried egg rolls. Sounds funny but they are tasty.

I had the tri-tip plate with potato salad and mac & cheese for the sides. After I orderded I was shocked to find they even have frito pie (a reason to come back for sure). I easily could have eaten an entire plate of their mac & cheese; it was that good. The place isn't huge however it can accomodate a large group (say 12 people). The atmosphere is pig kitsch with every pig figurine, pig t-shirt, or pig memoribilia available plastered all over the place.", "author": "Don O."}

No service to speak up, but some funny guys behind the counter. The pork is not bad, but not tasty enough on its own, yet I wasn't into their BBQ sauces, so overall didn't provide for the best meal. There are a couple of the standard BBQ sides, but they also are not that great. The cornbread was a little too sweet with out the balancing salt for my taste. Their breakfast menu seems promising, gotta try it sometime. It's not inexpensive, but BBQ rarely is. I just order the meat in pounds and get sides to make my own plate of food. It is a good place if your craving southern BBQ and don't have hours/days to grill your meats.", "author": "B C."}

I love bbq and soul food and am always looking for a new place to call comfort town.\nThis place however did not live up to the hype.\nSides were unbelievably small and not that tasty. There was no fried chicken. I had the spicy pulled chicken sandwich and it was less than  desirable. Dry and not at all seasoned. There was absolutely nothing on the sandwich which would've been fine had the meat been all that it was cracked up to be but in this case not so much. The sauces were alright at best watery and not really all that interesting when it came to taste. I found myself drenching the damn sandwich in the mustard sauce to choke it down.\nIts a bit pricey for what you get and I suggest ordering the tri-tip or pork ribs with like ten sides if your going to check this place out.\nThe one cool thing is that they do have brunch, the atmosphere is delightful...with brightly colored tablecloths and lots of chatchki on the walls to look at. Unfortunately it doesn't distract you from the fact that their BBQ was less than I expected. But hey thats what I get for expecting the best!", "author": "Charlie B."}

Today I had an andouille sausage sandwich and Liz had the Memphis style pork (pulled pork) and both were excellent, as were the sides of cole slaw and potato salad.  There really isn't better BBQ to be had in the Bay Area - at least not that I've found.  Having spent 10 years in Texas and 4+ in Tennessee, I've had my fair share of BBQ.  Though I'm fond of a few places in these far away states, my meals at Memphis Minnie's have been pretty close in comparison.  I've sat with the owner for a while discussing BBQ, and can really appreciate his method for learning the technique of the different styles on offer.  He's travelled to all of these areas on several occasions to understand and emmulate them, and I think he does a hell of a job.  My only complaint on this visit was the consistency of the pork - there wasn't quite enough texture.  I like to have some slightly chewy or at least stringy bits in my pulled pork, and this was fairly soft and pillowy.  Perhaps that's what he was going for.  The flavor is pretty spot on, but the smoky intensity of the pulled pork I've had a hunudred times in Nashville and Memphis was also sort of missing.   Ok, I guess that's two things.\n\nThe andouille was also very good, the only drawback being that it was overly salty.  It was certainly still edible, and enjoyable, but if the salt were turned down a bit it would have been heavenly (and the heat turned up a tad). \n\nI have to add that this is the first time I've tried the sambos there, and I was very impressed.  They arrive as just meat and bread, which looks a bit sparse, but with your three choices of BBQ sauce on the table (Texas style (cumin and tomato driven), South Carolina style (mustard base) and North Carolina style (vinegar base)) you're all set.  The bread is a sweet french roll, and very moist and complimentary to the meat.  I was expecting these to be dry, but the whole combo is very enjoyable.  \n\nTry it!", "author": "Pedro, aka Burgundy M."}

Don't be afraid of the bottles of sauce on the table not sure if these are different around the restaurant we had SC, NC and TX but TX was the hands down favorite with my squad. If you are lucky you ordered some rib tips, spicky pulled chicken, or pulled pork to go along with your ribs, that is if you still have room after hammering a mini-rack of baby back ribs. Taking a back seat to the meat are the sides, I would only get at these if you can't take any more or in my case finish all your que, they were pretty solid, can't really go wrong with southern style mac and cheese.\n Go here, eat, and you decide it hasn't won best BBQ in SF numerous times for nothing... how often will you have ribs, mac&cheese, and sake on purpose.", "author": "Sean W."}

It actually had little flavor at all.\n\nPlaces that take pride in their BBQ usually have a pit man checking on the final product going out.

There wasn't anyone doing much for quality control here, and I imagine you only get lucky if you are there when someone pulls some fresh meat out of the smoker. Otherwise the quality goes down from there.\n \n\nThe worst thing there was their corn muffins. They had an odd smokiness, not like smoke from the bbq, but smoke from the burned on grease that hasn't been cleaned from the pans in a long time. It actually permeated thrughout the muffin, The thick crunchy bits of corn meal are  odd to chew, but likely up to the individual if they like that sort of thing. \n\nThe mac n cheese was not all that memorable.

GOOD to very good... if anything, a bit overcooked (but better than undercooked imho). Flavor, good. Asked for the sauce on the side (finally realized that here in the bay they DROWN bbq in sauce - what are they hiding?!)\nSauce was good, but a bit too sweet, fruity and oddly spiced... but not bad. Can't say the same for the other sauce, the mustardy one.... we didn't like it. Too much like honey mustard dressing.\nNext: brisket. Very good, but a bit fatty ( I can't believe I just said that! Fat is SO my friend! But it's true!) tender and good flavor.\nWings - good, but definitely overcooked. Dry, dry, dry... not easy do that to wings, either!\nSo, the sides: Potato salad was 3* easily. Coleslaw was NOT what I wanted (like it creamy) but it was GREAT, if a bit on the sweet side (like everything). Well, 3 1/2* for sure. Fries...Surprisingly good! 3 1/2*.\ncorn muffins: too sweet, but actually very corny! 3 1/2*.... I sense a trend with this 3 1/2* thing!\nSo, all in all, Memphis Minnie would warrant a return!

The workers were friendly, and suggested I order the briskett sandwich...so I did. \n\nI ordered my meal to go and when it was ready I snatched it up, coated it in several of their sauces and ran out the door. It smelled great soI assumed that nothing could ruin this meal. Upon my first bite into it, I knew something wasn't quite right. The bread was dry, not sweet and moldy or anything, but seemed like it had been frozen and thawed via microwave. How dissapointing. The meat was also incredibly dry. Not cool. The fries, limp and greasy.\n\nI went back downstairs to address the issue at hand and they were closed. So wha did I do? I gave the sandwich to the homeless guy who stays in front of my place. I guarantee you'll see this guy if you come to Lower Haight, he's a staple here in this neighborhood. \n\nAnyway, would I reccomend Memphis Minnies? Hmm....if they kept fresh bread on hand and didn't overcook their briskett, possibly. I'm sick of justifying to myself the dismal condition of the San Francisco restaurants.

I don't think it's quite fair to compare BBQ in a health-conscious state like CA and an even healthier city like San Francisco to (no offense) TX/the South. But Memphis Minnie's is good, for SF. I was a little wary because I'm not a fan of pork and was worried that MM, with a pig as its mascot and Memphis in its name, would only serve pork BBQ. But boy, was I wrong! The menu is diverse, from Andouille sausage (BBQ isn't BBQ without sausage, folks) to chicken to beef brisket to meat by the pound. You aren't allowed to sit before you order but turnover is pretty fast. I would recommend the sweet iced tea - it wasn't too watery or too sweet. I sneaked peeks and what others ordered and the amount of food you get is pretty big for the price. The Boyfriend and I shared the Taster (two or three choices of meat with two sides and a cornbread muffin) and there was no way one person, unless very large or starving, can finish all of that. We had beef brisket, St. Louis cut ribs, Andouille sausage, sweet potatoes and BBQ fries. My favorite was the sausage. The brisket wasn't the best I've had but quite decent. The ribs were tender but a little bland. That's where the sauces come in -  you have your choice of four sauces: Texas red sauce, mustard sauce, vinegar sauce and hot sauce. The hot sauce is located on the counter directly to the right of the register (from your perspective, not the cashier's). There are little cups in which to pour some in and take back to your seat. I liked mixing the Texas red mixed with the hot sauce. Don't be deceived! The first taste of the sauce is very bland with no kick but give it a bit and it'll hit your mouth.

Hailing from Alabama (if you're ever there : Dreamland. You'll never have better ribs.), I'm highly suspect of BBQ places north of the Mason-Dixon line or West of the Mississippi...especially in San Francisco. That said... Memphis Minnie's is amazing.  Its enitre menu is a refreshing taste of home for any Southerner.  And it's an honest sample for anyone who isn't willing to travel 3000 miles for the original.  The first time I wandered in (skeptically), I chatted with the owner.  *Good sign of hospitality--and boding well for a good meal to come--he is always around the restaurant, checking to make sure his diners are satisfied.     I highly recommend the \"melt-in-your-mouth\" pulled pork and the tangy cole slaw (vinegar-based, not mayo).  And if you're not familiar with the 3 different kinds of sauce provided at the table : MIX 'EM!  All 3 tastes go really well together and you can never have too much sauce!

If you can snag a seat you are lucky as it is pretty much standing room for all who order and a thin line of tables along one side of this narrow restaurant.  The food is good for the money and there were a variety of BBQ sauces and condiments. The deep friend peach and pecan pie are pretty decent. The beef brisket is good but a little dry.  The ribs are not impressive to me. My fries were very well seasoned but a little limp. A  place for BBQ but not for service or atmosphere. Definitely a good  choice for take-out in the future.", "author": "Jamie C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-06-18", "description": "So far, I've only had an andouille sausage sandwich and the brisket as main dishes on two different occasions and personally I have to say that both were excellent. I actually liked the fact that the brisket was served dry because often barbecue joints dump way too much sauce on the plate to the point were it drowns out the natural smoked meat flavour and/or disguises the inferiority of the meat. Plus, they had a half dozen different styles of homemade sauce (including mustard, vinegar, and a sauce that was is supposed to be insanely hot but didn't really make me tear up until after about 6 tablespoons) on the table that I had fun mixing up different combinations of them on my plate. The brisket was so tender that I had a hard time keeping it on my fork. The mac and cheese and potato salad side dishes are seasoned and prepared with the same dedication as these their succulent, slow cooked barbecue.  The cornbread was moist and tasty without tasting too sugary like cake.  My only caveats would be their prices and the small portions of the side dishes; barbecue is historically inexpensive food and after spending about $18 on an entree, two side dishes, and a soft drink, I would at least expect the sides to come in breakfast cereal-size bowls instead of small cups that are more suitable for holding condiments. However, with the love that I've tasted in this food, I am intrigued enough to go back and sample the rest of the menu.", "author": "Rick E."}

And, for a while, Memphis Minnies did this for me. The meats are always cooked just right, the sides are excellent, the sauce options let you have some fun, the fries are seasoned well, and even sweet tea!! \nThe first night I attempted this dining establishment, this was my experience: the food was good, the person at the register was kind and answered our questions and even joked around with us (I think he was the owner). I thought I had found my place.\nBut. I went in a couple weeks later, on a Sunday, and had an experience to just knock the good one over. The food was still good, and arrived quickly, but the man at the counter WAS AWFUL. He rushed us through ordering, was rude to every customer in the restaurant, and even put his own staff on edge. There was no pleasant chitchat, but a tense, whispering silence, not only among those working, but hovering over the customers as well. Several people walked out before ordering as a result of his attitude and demeanor. We finished our meals quickly and thought, \"hey, maybe he was having a bad night, we'll give it another try next week.\"\nAnd I did, I brought my mother, who was in town visiting, after she had driven four hours or so through stop and go traffic. I thought this would provide us with the cozy atmosphere I remembered from my first night. EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE. The same man was working the register, and he was just as bad, if not worse. The situation was so stressful and unpleasant that we ended up leaving before our meals were finished. Several people walked out, mid-meal or before ordering. One group even canceled their orders. \nI glanced through reviews and didn't see anything similar to my experience, and was wondering if others had encountered this as well. Memphis Minnie's could be a perfectly decent bay area bbq restaurant, but it won't be getting my business until some serious customer service work is done.", "author": "Brittany B."}

This is going to be the closest thing to true BBQ that the City has to offer, just expect to pay City prices. The food is good in my opinion but there are better BBQ places throughout the Bay Area (See Big Nates or E&J in Oakland). The cornbread muffins are a little dry if you don't get them fresh from the oven (which is rare). One perks of this place is the variety of sauces you can use to spice up our choices (This is really a true sign of  a good BBQ joint in more historically significnt BBQ areas of this country). Beware of the Super Hot Sauce though, it will put a hole in the side of your mouth (among creating other problems) if you don't use it sparingly. The biggest problem here is the seating. There really is no room for a large party or any party of more than four people (I really recommend parties of two max). Parking is a problem as well which is why its best to send someone in with the order, circle the block for a few minutes and then take it home. They take credit cards too which always makes things easier.", "author": "Ryan M."}

It was served on a deli roll instead of the traditional hamburger bun which I supposed was questionable, but ultimately okay, as I wasn't really there for bread anyway. But it was completely devoid of sauce.  At first I thought there must have been some sort of mix up in the kitchen, or this was someone's cruel idea of a joke.  I had to sauce my own sandwich with cold, flavorless, runny BBQ sauce that was sitting in a squeeze bottle on my table.  And there was a disgusting amount of fat in the sandwich.  As someone else mentioned,  properly cooking the pork (slowly and for great duration) will eliminate most of the fat.  I shouldn't see huge globs of white gunk, nor should there be burnt bits on the meat.  Let's not even talk about the off-color macaroni and cheese.   I definitely did not trust this place to cook greens properly.   Another 'Southern' place in the Bay fails to impress, what else is new.", "author": "Karthi X."}
